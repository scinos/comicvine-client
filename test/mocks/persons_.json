        "description":"<h2>Career</h2><p>Joseph Quesada was born on January 12, 1962 and is a comic book editor. Joe Quesada was born in New York to Cuban parents and was raised in Jackson Heights, Queens. He went to the School of Visual Arts, where he earned a BFA in illustration in 1984. Quesada\u2019s art was heavily influenced by Manga, Japanese style artwork, which was shown by his drawings. He and his inking partner <a href=\"/jimmy-palmiotti/26-3068/\">Jimmy Palmiotti</a> made up an inking company called <a href=\"/event-comics/57-651/\">Event Comics</a>. While within this company, Quesada helped co-create some super heroes. One of his most notable creations was <a href=\"/ash/29-41248/\">Ash</a>, a firefighter with superpowers.</p><p>Quesada got his start in the early 90s working for <a href=\"/valiant/57-485/\">Valiant Comics</a> on titles <a href=\"/ninjak/29-4375/\">Ninjak</a> and <a href=\"/solar-man-of-the-atom/49-4607/\">Solar, Man of the Atom</a>. Soon after, he and his inking partner Jimmy Palmiotti created the publishing company, <a href=\"/event-comics/57-651/\">Event Comics</a>. During this time, Quesada also contributed to <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> for comics such as <a href=\"/the-ray/29-2049/\">The Ray</a>.</p><p><b>Marvel Comics</b></p><p>In 1998, Marvel Comics contracted Quesada and Event Comics to work on a new line, <a href=\"/marvel-knights/65-40427/\">Marvel Knights</a>. Using his personal contacts in the field, Quesada brought in names such as <a href=\"/brian-michael-bendis/26-40435/\">Brian Michael Bendis</a>, <a href=\"/david-mack/26-9037/\">Dave Mack</a>, and <a href=\"/garth-ennis/26-40644/\">Garth Ennis</a> to bring an original flair to the properties involved. During this time, Quesada worked with screenwriter/director <a href=\"/kevin-smith/26-42844/\">Kevin Smith</a>, illustrating a new <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> series, intent on bringing the wayward hero back to his roots.</p><p>In 2000, Quesada became editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics after the departure of <a href=\"/bob-harras/26-40985/\">Bob Harras</a>. He is the first artist to become editor-in-chief at <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a>. Quesada's ascension in the ranks occurred simultaneously with that of <a href=\"/bill-jemas/26-55732/\">Bill Jemas</a>, who became Marvel's president. The two worked closely together, and their efforts culminated in the all-new Ultimate line of Marvel Comics that modernized classic heroes such as <a href=\"/ultimate-spider-man/49-7257/\">Spider-Man</a> and the <a href=\"/ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\">X-Men</a> for new, younger readers.</p><p>Quesada also imposed a moratorium on reviving characters who have died over the years and stated that \"dead is dead.\" When asked about comics that revived deceased characters, Quesada stated that the policy wasn't an absolute mandate, but rather a rule of thumb to present to writers so that stories requiring a resurrection of a character wouldn't become frequent or produced without gravity.</p><p>In 2010, Quesada was named Chief Creative Officer of Marvel Entertainment and left his editor-in-chief role in January 2011, being replaced by <a href=\"/axel-alonso/26-23115/\">Axel Alonso</a>.</p>",

She wrote and pencilled the special collector's edition Elfquest ashcan comic book \"Pack Mates\" with children's illustrator Nicole Tadgell.</p><p>Richard Pini used one of Wulff's drawings for the cover of the Elfquest anthology #28, in 1998. The cover was nominated for the 1998 R.A.C. Squiddy award for best cover artist. That same year, Wulff penciled a pin-up of Blair's Hawk and Windblade characters which was inked by Blair and colored by Colin (Chan) Walbridge. The pin-up appeared in issue #1 of Legend of the Elflord. This introduction began a three year collaboration between Blair, Walbridge and Wulff on the titles: <i>Legend of the Elflord</i>, <i>Lynx</i>, <i>Sapphire</i>, <i>Dick Sweeney</i>, <i>Demon Hunter</i>, <i>Dark Island</i> and <i>Sno</i>.</p><p>Wulff primarily lettered the comics and helped with some of the inking. She also did some production work for the Editions Paquet publication of Mutant Aliens by Bill Plympton.</p><p>Wulff exited the comic book industry in 2002. She is currently a freelance writer and artist, who creates and sells comic-style paintings of her original yelodoggie character.</p>",

        "description":"<p><b>Barry Blair</b> was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada circa 1954. He spent most of his young life in China. He filled his school notebooks with sketches of comic book characters and at a very young age, he created the character of Elflord Hawk Ericksson. Barry started doing animation at the age of thirteen for the Canadian television show \"You Can't Do That on Television\"</p><p>A few years later, while working for a heating/cooling company called Aircel, when the owner decided to close up shop, Barry convinced him to invest in starting a comic book publishing company, and Aircel Comics was born. Barry published a plethora of comics under Aircel, including Elflord, Samurai, and adult works such as Leather and Lace and Climaxxx. This company went on to publish notable works like Men in Black that were later made into movies. It was bought by Malibu which was in turn purchased by Marvel.</p><p>Barry has worked with many other artists and writers in the comic industry, and has often teamed up with one or two people for an extended time. He has published work with many comic companies, among them: Malibu, Mad Monkey, Peregrine Entertainment, Davdez, NBM Publishing, Editions Paquet and Warp Graphics. An early sketch of Hawk appeared as fanart in an issue of Elfquest in the 1980's, bringing Barry to the attention of the Pini's. By the early 1990's he was on the staff at Warp where he created art for several titles, among them \"New Blood\", \"Fire Eye\" and \"Blood of Ten Chiefs\". Shortly after the turn of the century, Barry became immersed in the online gaming community and began doing commissioned sketches of characters for players. He is a prolific artist who will leave behind a huge catalog of work.</p><p>Barry died of a brain aneurysm on January 3rd, 2010, which had been misdiagnosed as an ear infection.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Joe emigrated to the U.S. from Israel when he was 5 years old. His American cousin had a bunch of comic books Joe was fascinated by. Since Joe didn't speak the language, he was attracted to the pictures and, like all kids, he drew his own comics. Eventually he wanted to be an artist. At age 11 he attended classes in New York (where he lived) at the Arts Students League. His art teacher was Arthur J. Foster, son of the great Hal Foster (creator/artist of \"Prince Valiant,\" one of the most highly-regarded comic strips in history). </p><p>  Josef's idol at the time was Neal Adams whom he met at a comic book convention when he was 13 years old. Josef asked if he could work at his and Dick Giordano 's new studio, Continuity Associates. About 1971 or 1972 Joe became their assistant.He met and assisted many legendary artists while working there, including Wally Wood, Russ Heath, Gray Morrow, Jim Starlin, Jeff Jones, Bernie Wrightson , and Klaus Janson , among others.Then when Josef was 17 years old, he became a freelance artist and that was 32 years ago. He has worked for every major comics company and has the Guinness record for having inked more pencillers than any other inker--because of his inking \"The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe\" on and off for 20 years. </p><p>Joe is also an award-winning portrait artist and illustrator. </p><p>Examples of Joe's re-creations and commissions can be seen at his gallery at http://www.Comicartfans.com</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Career</h2><h3>Emerging Artist</h3><p>Born in Mexico, Humberto Ramos was trained by Oscar Gonz\u00e1lez Guerrero &amp; Oscar Gonz\u00e1lez Loyo who introduced him to the comic book conventions held in the United States. It was at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-diego-comic-con/34-55786/\">San Diego Comic-Con</a> of 1993 when he was discovered by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/walter-simonson/26-7943/\">Walt Simonson</a> and introduced to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/milestone/57-538/\">Milestone Media</a>. His first published work in America appeared in 1994's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hardware/49-5213/\">Hardware</a>, and a year later he was introduced to a wider audience through the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> title, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/impulse/49-5509/\">Impulse</a>. He followed up his success on Impulse with the first few issues of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildstorm/57-708/\">Wildstorm</a> team <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dv8/49-6537/\">DV8</a>, but left soon after to focus on a new project.</p><h3>Cliffhanger</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"84716\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/84716-31270-humberto-ramos_super.jpg\" title=\"Crimson #13\"><img id=\"84716\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/84716-31270-humberto-ramos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Crimson #13\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Crimson #13</div></div></div></div><p>1998 saw the launch of a new imprint from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jim-lee/26-2399/\">Jim Lee's</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/image/57-513/\">Image</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cliffhanger/57-2287/\">Cliffhanger</a> featured three titles that were created, owned and plotted by their artists. The three artists were <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joe-madureira/26-12292/\">Joe Madureira</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jeff-scott-campbell/26-40772/\">J Scott Campbell</a>, and Humberto Ramos. While Madureira and Campbell were notoriously slow, putting release dated back by moths (sometimes years), with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/battle-chasers/49-9388/\">Battle Chasers</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-girl/49-6841/\">Danger Girl</a> respectively, Ramos' work on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson/49-6320/\">Crimson</a> was rarely late.</p><p>Crimson dealt with themes of Christian mythology, featuring a reincarnated saint, fallen angels, vampires and werewolves. The plot surrounded Alex Elder, a teenaged boy who was transformed into a vampire &amp; became the chosen one to save the world. The series built up to an action packed climax in the 24th issue, while Danger Girl &amp; Battle Chasers were struggling with their 4th or 5th issues.</p><p>Although Crimson finished in early 2001, Ramos soon followed it up with another title a few months later. Out There featured a bunch of high school kids who tried to battle supernatural forces, at a time when shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer were popular. Although not as successful as Crimson, Out There lasted for 18 issues, ending in the summer of 2003.</p><h3>Marvel</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"84734\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/84734-16235-humberto-ramos_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men #194\"><img id=\"84734\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/84734-16235-humberto-ramos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men #194\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men #194</div></div></div></div><p>Much like his Cliffhanger co-creators, Ramos began to do variant covers for other publishers. This gave him more and more work with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-publishing/57-31/\">Marvel</a>, and resulted in him working on the a four-issue story arc ' Death in the Family' in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peter-parker-spider-man/49-9142/\">Peter Parker: Spider-Man</a> with the writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paul-jenkins/26-41631/\">Paul Jenkins</a>. This in turn brought Ramos &amp; Jenkins more work with marvel's web-slinger's new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spectacular-spider-man/49-11069/\">Spectacular Spider-Man</a> series.</p><p>His work with Marvel continued as he enjoyed a successful run on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/49-10809/\">Wolverine</a>, which included the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a> tie-in issues, and later on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/49-10731/\">X-Men</a>. However, his work was included in the popular X-Men cross-over story line <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah CompleX</a> where his art style did not match those of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">Uncanny X-Men</a> artist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/david-finch/26-3226/\">David Finch</a>. The wide difference in styles has brought criticism among some fans.</p><p>Continuing his relationship with Marvel, Ramos completed a run on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/runaways-vol-2/49-11872/\">Runaways</a> with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terry-moore/26-3635/\">Terry Moore</a> and a four-issue story arc '<a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Disassembled</a>' in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-the-initiative/49-18419/\">Avengers: Initiative</a>.</p><p>He is currently the artist for <a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man/49-2127/\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> with Stefano Casselli.He is changing up with him.He is also doing some covers for some of the Marvel books.</p><h3>Other Works</h3><p>Humberto Ramos has enjoyed a successful and on-going working relationship with Marvel, but he has continued to work with other creators and publishers outside of 'The House of Ideas'.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"772533\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/772533-fairycopy001copy_super.jpg\" title=\"Fairy Quest\"><img id=\"772533\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/772533-fairycopy001copy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fairy Quest\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fairy Quest</div></div></div></div><p>After his run on Spider-Man, Ramos teamed-up with Paul Jenkins to work for <a href=\"/dark-horse-comics/57-364/\">Dark Horse Comics</a>. Although Revelations had originally been planned as a Cliffhanger six-issue mini series two years earlier. The series experienced some unfortunate delays.</p><p>Ramos created the Kamikaze series for Wildstorm. However, instead of being the creator and owner (as her had previously been with Cliffhanger &amp; Dark Horse), he left the illustrations to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/francisco-herrera/26-48445/\">Francisco Herrera</a>.</p><p>While working on Wolverine with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marc-guggenheim/26-42339/\">Marc Guggenheim</a>, Ramos was also being published by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/soleil/57-2000/\">Soleil Productions</a>. The French company produced K, a space opera written by the French author Crisse. This has recently been translated &amp; released in English by Marvel, under the name <a href=\"/kookaburra-k/49-29862/\">Kookaburra K</a>, which is a 'Mature Content' flagged title.</p><p>Once again, Ramos has teamed-up with Paul Jenkins to work on a series that the two of them first conceived years ago. Fairy Quest was due for release through Soleil. However due to unforeseen problems the project has moved away from Soliel, and they are currently looking for another publisher for Fairy Quest.</p><p>In the meantime, Humberto Ramos has continued to work with Marvel producing several variant covers, regular humorous covers for <a href=\"/deadpool-team-up/49-29329/\">Deadpool Team-Up</a>, and tweeting with other artists &amp; fans on Twitter.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Eli Katz (April 6, 1926, Riga, Latvia \u2013 January 31, 2000, Miami, Florida, United States) who worked under the name Gil Kane and in a few instances Scott Edwards, was a comic book artist whose career spanned the 1940s to 1990s and every major comics company and character. Kane co-created the modern-day versions of the superheroes <a href=\"/green-lantern/49-2013/\">Green Lantern</a> and <a href=\"/the-atom/49-2051/\">The Atom</a> for <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a>, and co-created <a href=\"/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> with <a href=\"/roy-thomas/26-42067/\">Roy Thomas</a> for <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel Comics</a>. He was involved in such major storylines as a groundbreaking arc in <a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man/49-2127/\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> #96\u201398 (May-July 1971) that, at the behest of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, bucked the then-prevalent <a href=\"/comics-code-authority/12-42382/\">Comics Code Authority</a> to depict drug abuse, and ultimately spurred an update of the Code. Kane additionally pioneered an early graphic novel prototype, His Name is...Savage, in 1968, and a seminal graphic novel, Blackmark, in 1971. In 1997, he was inducted into both <a href=\"/eisner-awards/12-52148/\">the Will Eisner</a> Comic Book Hall of Fame and <a href=\"/harvey-awards/12-55975/\">the Harvey Award</a> Jack Kirby Hall of Fame.</p>",

        "description":"<p>John has been a part of some of the most popular story lines of all time including: <a href=\"/dark-phoenix-saga/39-42183/\">The Dark Phoenix</a> story arc and <a href=\"/days-of-future-past/39-44425/\">Days of Future Past</a> from the X-Men. He also had a memorable run doing the Fantastic Four which included the trial of Reed Richards after he saved the life of Galactus. In the 90's he also had a lengthy stint where he revitalized <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC's</a> flagship character, <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>.</p><p>One of John's favorite things to do when he gets a hold of a series is to do some serious Ret-conning. Every comic he has worked on he has changed aspects of the characters origin or history. Sometimes it works for the better, most of the time it just creates controversy.</p><h2>Biography</h2><p>John Byrne was born July 6, 1950 in Walsall, England where he got his first taste of American superheroes through television programs (The Adventures of Superman). At the age of 8, he -along with his parents Frank and Elsie- moved to Canada where he continued his schooling, though Byrne admits that he was not gifted in the academic world. Also, for 15 years he was married to the actress/photographer Andrea Braun.</p><p>In 1962, John Byrne read <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee's</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby's</a> Fantastic Four #5, his first <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> comic, and in his opinion \"the book had an 'edge' like nothing DC was putting out at the time\". It was only later that Jack Kirby's work would have its full effect on John Byrne who would end up working with many of the characters this man had helped create. Another influence to Byrne, though this time in art style was the comic book artist <a href=\"/neal-adams/26-1768/\">Neal Adams</a>.</p><p>Eight years later, in 1970, John joined the Alberta College of Art and Design, which was located in Calgary. At the school his comic book career began, at first it was when he created Gay Guy (a character meant to parody superheroes and the stereotypical homosexual art student) for the college newspaper. This comic is more remembered however, as in it appeared a prototype for <a href=\"/snowbird/29-8474/\">Snowbird</a>, a character Byrne would create years later. He also had his first published comic book while attending the school, it was called ACA Comix #1 and featured The Death's Head Knight. However, John Byrne left the college in 1973, without actually graduating.</p><p>In August 1974, he began his real work in comics when he illustrated a two-page black-and-white short story in <a href=\"/skywald/57-214/\">Skywald Publications'</a> Nightmare #20. So it was that he eventually became a freelance artist for <a href=\"/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a>, for whom he created his first colored comic, Rog-2000 (a back story in the <a href=\"/e-man/49-2603/\">E-Man</a> series). While working for Charlton, Byrne also did work on series like Emergency!, Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch and Space: 1999. He also co-created Doomsday 1, with <a href=\"/joe-gill/26-51233/\">Joe Gill</a>, it was a science fiction series that took place in a post-apocalyptic world.</p><h2>The Curse</h2><p>Byrne is sometimes believed to possess the power to predict events in our world, when he does his comics, and of course these events are predominantly tragedies.</p><p>Some of the events and corresponding comics include:</p><p>-In Marvel Team-Up (1977) Byrne had a blackout in New York City, a blackout actually did occur the month the comic went on sale...Byrne had drawn it six months earlier</p><p>-Then, in Uncanny X-Men he made a story in which there was a massive earthquake in Japan, and again it happened the month the comic went on sale</p><p>-However, one of the biggest instances was an issue of Wonder Woman, for whose cover was a newspapers headlined \"Princess Diana dies\"...three days after the comic went on the shelves, Princess Diana of Britain died</p><h2>Impact</h2><p>This is a list of some of the comics he has worked on before and how he made an impact on them:</p><p><b>Alpha Flight:</b> <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a> was a team and series that Byrne reluctantly created when Marvel convinced him to create a Canadian superhero team. Originally Alpha Flight was \"merely to survive a fight with the X-Men\" but the book became really popular and sold more than 500,000 first issues. Byrne however never really enjoyed working on the book and thought of the characters as being flat. One of Byrne's biggest impacts on the comic book universe through Alpha Flight was the creation of the homosexual superhero Northstar even though this sexuality was simply hinted at while Byrne worked on the series.</p><p><b>Avengers West Coast:</b> While working on Avengers West Coast (from issues 42-57) Byrne took the story of Vision into his own hands and utterly changed many things about him. First off it turned out that his creation as told by Ultron was a lie. Vision was then changed by Byrne so that he would no longer have emotion and it was revealed his and Wanda's children were simply pieces of <a href=\"/mephisto/29-2635/\">Mephisto's</a> soul. Also, in this short run, Byrne created the Great Lakes Avengers, one of comic's oddest superhero teams.</p><p><b>Captain America:</b> John Byrne once worked on Captain America for nine issues alongside <a href=\"/roger-stern/26-41502/\">Roger Stern</a> and during this time in issue #250 had a story where Captain America was nominated to become President of the United States.</p><p><b>Fantastic Four:</b> However one of Byrne's major works was the Fantastic Four to which he brought forth a second <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age</a>. He went all the way back to the beginning but this time around there were some huge changes. He had <a href=\"/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> replace the <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> as a member of the team while Byrne wrote Thing's solo comic. Alicia Masters was no longer with Ben Grimm and instead hooked up with Johnny Storm. <a href=\"/baxter-building/34-41454/\">The Baxter Building</a> was demolished and in its place was <a href=\"/four-freedoms-plaza/34-42378/\">Four Freedoms Plaza</a>, the new headquarters for the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>. Yet, one of the biggest changes was transforming Invisible Girl into <a href=\"/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>, the most powerful member of the team. Eventually however Byrne left the book allegedly because \"it simply started to get old\" but it has also been mentioned that \"internal office politics\" were part of the reason.</p><p><b>Iron Man:</b> During a short stint, John Byrne wrote for about 20 issues of Iron Man. In that time he featured the super villain <a href=\"/fin-fang-foom/29-8145/\">Fin Fang Foom</a>, returned The Mandarin to his status as a major Iron Man villain and started a second <a href=\"/armorstark-wars/39-55741/\">Armor Wars</a> story arc.</p><p><b>Namor the Sub-Mariner:</b> John Byrne created this series and in it he displayed a different side to Namor, showing him as a business man and the head of Oracle Inc., a company on the surface world. For twenty-five issues Byrne wrote and drew the series bur when new artist Jae Lee came, he utterly transformed the mood and plot line of the book, Byrne quit writing the series after thirty-two issues.</p><p><b>Superman</b>: For a time, Byrne took a break from working at Marvel Comics and instead was hired by DC to do a retcon of the iconic superhero, Superman, which was needed after the Crisis of Infinite Earths storyline. This reworking of the superhero that is supposedly greater than any other in the eyes of the public got the media's attention and so articles were published everywhere including The New York Times. Byrne completely revamped Superman and himself stated that, \"I'm taking Superman back to the basics...it's basically Siegel and Shuster's Superman meets the Fleischer Superman in 1986.\" Kal-El's mighty power was drastically reduced from his Silver Age version but he remained one of the mightiest beings in the DC Universe. Byrne changed the story so the Kents were still alive and often the support of Superman in his adult years. However Byrne got rid of Krypto, the Fortress of Solitude and the fact that Superman ever was Super-boy (which he regrets as it ruins the very idea of the Legion of Super-Heroes). John Byrne also made Clark Kent a man who actually fit in with society and was more of an ordinary human, or at least wished to be one, in his youth believing Earth to be his true home. Finally, Byrne explained how Clark Kent kept his identity secret for both the snapping of photos and his frame. The first was explained as Clark using his super speed to move the molecules of his face at a rapid pace to make it blurry in photos and for the second he possessed a weight training set to make an excuse for his build. This Superman made his debut in The Man of Steel a six issue miniseries describing his origins. Byrne did a lot of work on almost all of Superman's titles, especially in 1988 when it was The Last Son of Krypton's 50th anniversary. He continued this routine for two years but quit as he felt no support, especially since the line of Superman merchandise differed from the version he had remade for the comics.</p><p><b>The Sensational She-Hulk:</b> When requested to do so by his editor, <a href=\"/mark-gruenwald/26-41607/\">Mark Gruenwald</a>, John Byrne began work on a new series in 1989, The Sensational She-Hulk which was supposed to be a huge change from her earlier series, <a href=\"/the-savage-she-hulk/49-3053/\">The Savage She-Hulk</a>. So Byrne made a comic that was meant to be humorous and often had She-Hulk break the \"fourth wall\". He was allegedly fired from the series after eight issues when his ideas were ignored and instead his editor, <a href=\"/bobbie-chase/26-42585/\">Bobbie Chase</a>, was changing his stories so they would fit along with the She-Hulk: Ceremony graphic novel. However, when Byrne got a new editor, <a href=\"/renee-witterstaetter/26-2085/\">Ren\u00e9e Witterstaetter</a> he returned to the series for issues thirty-one to fifty.</p><p><b>The Uncanny X-Men:</b> In December of 1977, John Byrne began working on The X-Men (eventually becomes the Uncanny X-Men) with <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a>. Because of their work together in the series, they have their claim to fame and the series becomes one of the best-selling series in comics. Yet eventually, Byrne and Claremont's relationship got in the way and the fact that Byrne was losing all joy in pursuing the project that he left at issue #143.</p><h2>Creations and Co-Creations</h2><p>John Byrne has created many characters for various companies, here is a chronological list of some of them:</p><p>1- In February of 1978, predating Alpha Flight, John Byrne and Chris Claremont created the character that would eventually lead the team, <a href=\"/guardian/29-5047/\">Guardian</a>.</p><p>2- Byrne single-handedly created <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a>, the Canadian super hero team he was assigned to make.

        "description":"<p>Born in Brooklyn New York, he took a cartooning course at the local YMCA. From there he began working on the syndicated feature Dumb Dora, then he worked on Embarassing Moments and then Just Kids. Whitney Ellsworth began working for <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">National Allied Publishing</a> (which would later be known as DC) in 1934 where he worked as assistant editor. He worked on stories like Billy the Kid, <a href=\"/little-linda/29-63191/\">Little Linda</a> and <a href=\"/more-fun-comics/49-19320/\">More Fun Comics</a> and doing the cover roughs of a number of the early D.C. titles. He briefly left the company around 1936 for a stay in California but returned shortly after. By 1937 he was hired full time at D.C. where he became the editorial director of all D.C. titles until around 1953.</p><p>Ellsworth was the chief guiding force at D.C. for most of the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age</a>, writing, doing cover layouts, art directing, editing and developing new projects. Some of his flagship titles include <a href=\"/superman/49-773/\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"/batman/49-796/\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a>, <a href=\"/adventure-comics/49-3105/\">Adventure Comics</a>, <a href=\"/action-comics/49-18005/\">Action Comics</a>, <a href=\"/green-lantern/49-25944/\">Green Lantern</a>, <a href=\"/all-star-comics/49-2833/\">All-Star Comics</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/49-18525/\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> (just to name a few).</p><p>Definitely his most notable deed at DC was when <a href=\"/batman/49-796/\">Batman</a> #1 was launched a 2 part story featuring an all new villain known as <a href=\"/joker/29-1702/\">The Joker</a> was to battle with Batman and Robin and in the end The Joker was going to die. Whitney Ellsworth felt The Joker character was too note-worthy and made a last minute change to the script and another panel was added to the last page--and although it was crudely drawn (probably by Bob Kane and inked by Sheldon Moldoff)--it portrayed the Joker surviving. This was the single edit that kept the Joker around. To this day Batman is synonymous with the Joker but it would not have been were it not for the Whitney Ellsworth.</p><p>Whitney Ellsworth was also the movie studio liaison for D.C., producing and editing <i>The Adventures of Superman</i> TV series among other projects.</p><p>Ellsworth left D.C. in 1971.</p>",

A self-taught artist, he initially put himself through three years of film school and worked for a time directing TV news before leaving his home state.

His artistic influences include many artists and writers across a broad spectrum of different media, but his favorite is American artist and illustrator N.C. Wyeth.

        "description":"<b>Gary Frank</b> (born 1969) is a British comic book artist and penciller, notable for his work on Midnight Nation and Supreme Power, both written by J. Michael Straczynski. He has also worked with author Peter David on The Incredible Hulk and Supergirl, and had a creator-owned series, Kin Comic, which he wrote himself, published by Top Cow in 2000.<br /><br />In his early career he frequently worked with inker Cam Smith (The Incredible Hulk, Supergirl, Gen 13).<br /><br />On May 10, 2007, having worked several years on a Marvel exclusive contract, Frank signed a new one with DC Comics. He most recently served as the regular series artist on Action Comics with writer Geoff Johns. After the New Krypton story arc, Action Comics became a title headlined by Kryptonian heroes Nightwing and Flamebird. As a result of this, the creative team on Action Comics changed. <br /><br />Frank and Johns will still be working with Superman, however, in a graphic novel format entitled Superman: Secret Origin. The story features what Johns and DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio are calling a \"definitive\" telling of the origin story of Superman, dealing with his life in Smallville, his first adventure with the Legion of Super-Heroes as Superboy, and his arrival in Metropolis and at the Daily Planet. Superman (or Clark), is struggling with being an outsider, and is not sure what to do with his life. Superman: Secret Origin is set to come out in October of 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Frank and Jonhs are also supposed to work on Batman: Earth One. A story, with Bruce Wayne beginning his career as the Dark Knight of Gotham City. &nbsp;",
