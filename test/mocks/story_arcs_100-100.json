        "description":"<h2>Background</h2><p>When the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> had a mental breakdown and destroyed the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> (<a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a>), her brother <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> convinced her to alter reality. In a flash of light the world was changed. Mutants were no longer the minority, hated for the way they were born. Instead, normal humans were subjugated by the powerful mutagenic and super-powered population under the rule of <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>. Everyone lived content in this new world, knowing nothing of their original histories, only aware of this new world that the Scarlet Witch created. Slowly the Earth's heroes were awakened to what actually occurred by <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, the mysterious young mutant named <a href=\"/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a>, and a small band of rebels. Things came to a breaking point during a battle at a celebration at Magneto's palace when the rebel group attacked. After <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>'s eyes were opened to what had actually occurred the world flashed bright white again and the Scarlet Witch changed reality back to how it was with a major exception--over 90% of the world's mutants were now de-powered and a population of mutants that once numbered in the millions now only totalled in the thousands.</p><p>Mutants are an even smaller minority than before. Many are taking the opportunity to target the remaining mutants. Few are aware of what actually occurred during this <a href=\"/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> (referred to commonly as <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a>). Speculation as to the reason for the mass de-powering range from a government conspiracy to an act of God. The once proud and mighty Magneto was one of the many mutants left powerless by his daughter. A being called the <a href=\"/the-collective/29-42938/\">The Collective</a>, composed of the powers of all the de-powered mutants was born, came down from Alaska to locate Magneto. Telling Magneto that the mutant world needed a leader and that they would follow him, the Collective re-powered Magneto. Controlled by the Collective mind, Magneto is forced to battle the Avengers, who were able to remove the Collective from him. Magneto's weak body was taken into <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> custody, but the helicopter he was on exploded in mid-air. He has not been seen since.</p><p>Further reading: <a href=\"/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>, <a href=\"/decimation/39-43626/\">Decimation</a></p><h2>Overview</h2><p>A young <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">Mutant</a> named Landru is dead. He was not a member of a super-powered peace keeping team. His powers were relatively unimportant. His death was not even out of the ordinary. Landru was hit by a motor vehicle and subsequently died. Still with the number of surviving mutants now numbering in the hundreds rather than the millions that once existed, the death of <i>any</i> mutant is a solemn occasion for mutant-kind. Most of the current <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> as well as the members <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> paid a visit to Landru's funeral. Even <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">Sebastian Shaw</a>, concealed by an image inducer, attended to pay his respects. All who attended the funeral understand some of its implications but perhaps more than <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a>. Beast reveals that since the events of <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a> not a single mutant child has been born. It is as if the mutant race was simply removed from the equation.</p><p>Beast has sought help from some of the world's brightest minds including <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, and <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> to no avail. None were able to help discern the root of mutancy's disappearance. Still determined to understand the root cause of mutant-kind's endangerment, and possibly restoring the species, Beast summons the nerve to invite some of the X-Men's greatest adversaries into the picture in hopes that such a team could discover what is happening. He initiates talks with the likes of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>, <a href=\"/arnim-zola/29-14876/\">Arnim Zola</a>, <a href=\"/dr-kavita-rao/29-4446/\">Dr. Kavita Rao</a>, <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>, <a href=\"/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a>, <a href=\"/spiral/29-9722/\">Spiral</a>, <a href=\"/sugar-man/29-3435/\">Sugar Man</a>, <a href=\"/pandemic/29-42336/\">Pandemic</a>, and the <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a> by way of a video conference in hopes that the competition between them would bait at least one of them into giving some form of assistance. Beast offers that in his research he has already discovered several important facets of their race which anyone who helped would become privy to, less some finds which he felt were too dangerous which he \"took off of the table\" by destroying. Contrary to Beast's hopes and expectations interest in teaming up remained low in the group. M.O.D.O.K. said that <a href=\"/aim/65-13497/\">A.I.M</a> had their own plans for exploiting the situation. Still recovering from having his life's work thwarted by the likes of the X-Men, Pandemic offered no assistance and hopes for the extinction of mutants. Always arrogant, Mr. Sinister says that there is nothing scientifically that Beast has to offer him. Despite the mass rejection, Beast finds himself curious at the comments of one--the High Evolutionary--who remarked that he should not attempt to embark on such a journey when starting in the wrong direction.</p><p>Needing elaboration on his earlier comments, Beast embarks on a journey to meet with the High Evolutionary face-to-face in his hidden home high at the top of Wungadore Mountain. With the assistance of a team of locals that he hired (and with his appearance altered by an image inducer) Beast works to scale the mountain. Toward the top they are stopped by the Knights of Wungadore--the High Evolutionary's personal guards, who intend to turn Beast around. After fighting with the Knights and attempting to plead his case the image of the Evolutionary appears before them and commands his servants to allow Beast entrance to his fortress. There Beast pleads his case to the High Evolutionary himself, begging for some assistance in his quest to save mutants from the brink of extinction. Rather than offer assistance, the Evolutionary tries to talk Beast into abandoning his cause as he believes that the Extinction of mutant kind may simply be natural selection in action--regardless of its catalyst. The Evolutionary also divulges that Beast is not the first person to come to him in search of these same answers, but without elaborating on who else has taken up Beast's quest before him the High Evolutionary fades away revealing that Beast was again talking with a image of the Evolutionary as he continued his work elsewhere. The High Evolutionary commands his subjects to escort Beast out of the compound so that he may leave. With little more to go on than before, Beast must seek help elsewhere.</p><p>The next stop in his journey is at the research laboratory of Dr. Kativa Rao. With the scientific help of the extra-terrestrial enemy of the X-Men <a href=\"/ord/29-4445/\">Ord</a> of the Breakworld, Rao had developed a \"cure\" which would permanently remove the mutant <a href=\"/x-gene/12-42328/\">X-Gene</a> from a mutant's genome making them human. Rao had fallen out of favor in the scientific community when it was revealed that her research and data was not her own but was instead provided by Ord. A laughingstock, Rao was now giving what help she could to one of the very mutant that even considered taking her \"cure\". Rao informed Beast that little was to be learned from her data. She informed him that she was done her quest, and that Beast could take anything from her that he needed, although she knew that she had nothing that would help. She revealed a refrigerator which held gene samples taken from thousands of mutants prior to M-Day which were provided to her by Ord. Even these genetic samples no longer contained any trace of the x-gene, just like their previous owners. Beast learns from this that the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> had not only de-powered millions of mutants around the world, save for the few remaining members of the species she eliminated all traces of the mutant x-gene which gave them their unique powers and abilities.</p><p>Hank's next stop was at the rumored Neverland facility, a compound in Canada created by the <a href=\"/weapon-x/65-5018/\">Weapon X</a> program for unethical experiments on mutants as well as eventual termination. This place, as Beast would discover, was not very unlike the camps used by the Nazi's during World War II. All that remained of the facility was the remains of the buildings as well as the impeccable daily records records kept by those in charge. Beast notices evidence of \"the other\" which the High Evolutionary had alluded to having already been there. Not only did this other rifle through the same records which Beast needed, he searched step by step in the same manner that Beast would, only days earlier. There was even evidence of the same search protocols having been used which Beast himself would run. Beast read through the horrific accounts of Neverland--from the experiments conducted, to the prevention of riots, to the collection and final extermination of its inmates as the facility would be closed down. Leaving the buildings to attempt to recover the mass-graves of the once occupants of Neverland Beast is confronted by a face he did not expect to see--the evil and infamous doppelganger of himself from an alternate version of Earth where <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a> ruled--<a href=\"/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a>.</p><p>The Endangered Species Story Arc is slated to kick off June 2007 with the Endangered Species One-Shot and is supposed to continue through October 2007.</p><h2>Related Story Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> - The catalyst that created the <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a>, Endangered Species, and several other story arcs when the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> altered reality and de-powered over 90% of the Earth's mutant population.</p><p><a href=\"/decimation/39-43626/\">Decimation</a> - The events following the House of M, occurring between the House of M and Endangered Species story arcs.</p><p><a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah CompleX</a> - The events that occur after the events of Endangered Species following the first mutant child born since M-Day.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/uncanny-x-men-extremists/49-28512/\">Uncanny X-Men: Extremists</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-endangered-species/49-30728/\">X-Men: Endangered Species</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-exklusiv-/37-291773/\">Marvel Exklusiv #75</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-x-men-/37-275097/\">New X-Men #32</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-x-men-/37-275099/\">New X-Men #33</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-x-men-/37-275100/\">New X-Men #34</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patrulla-x-/37-292810/\">Patrulla-X #28</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patrulla-x-/37-292811/\">Patrulla-X #29</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patrulla-x-/37-292812/\">Patrulla-X #30</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patrulla-x-/37-292813/\">Patrulla-X #31</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor-/37-299395/\">X-Factor #18</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor-/37-299396/\">X-Factor #19</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor-/37-299397/\">X-Factor #20</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor-/37-299398/\">X-Factor #21</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-especie-en-peligro-/37-299655/\">X-Men: Especie en Peligro</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300018/\">X-Men #79</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300019/\">X-Men #80</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300020/\">X-Men #81</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300021/\">X-Men #82</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300022/\">X-Men #83</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300023/\">X-Men #84</a> (Brazil)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300172/\">X-Men #135</a> (France)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300440/\">X-Men #27</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300441/\">X-Men #28</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300442/\">X-Men #29</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300443/\">X-Men #30</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-/37-300444/\">X-Men #31</a> (Spain)</li></ul>",

        "description":"<p>After investigating what appears to be a gang-related murder, Detective Lieutenant David Grey of the LAPD finds that the only witness who comes forward is a young man who grew up with the deceased, he says that the young man laying in a pool of rain water and his own blood only a few yards away was moving illegal drugs for a man named Jaeker, who is under the protection of a group called \u2018The Men\u2019. Just when the informant has mentioned this an unmarked black van screeches to a stop and shines it high-beams at the officer and the young man, surprisingly the van turns away and in the confusion the young man disappears into the night.</p> <p>Back at the station, Grey\u2019s Captain feels that this case is better left alone since gang members killing each other is progress in his book.</p> <p>Sometime later, Grey is called to the scene of a grizzly homicide. The walls and ceiling of an apartment splattered with blood. The remains have been cut apart and placed in various areas of the apartment almost as a bad joke... and a warning to others. He finds the head in the refrigerator with the eyes taken out and scrawled in blood on the back wall says: \u201cTALKS TOO MUCH\u201d. Grey recognizes the head as belonging to the young man who came forward earlier.</p> <p>Grey decides that recent events put Jaeker at the top of his list of suspects for both murders. After looking references to \u2018The Men\u2019 and finding nothing, he looked up Jaeker\u2019s rap sheet and found it was as long as his arm and an out-state-Warrant from Washington. He decided it was time to bring Jaeker in.</p> <p>He led a squad to Jaeker\u2019s apartment building and got about halfway up the stairs when the lights were cut. Grey quickly found that his squad was torn apart and he was alone against a group of goblin-like creatures with wide Joker-like grins, as Jaeker ordered them to kill him. Grey was able to get off a couple shots which sent Jaeker though the window from several stories up. Grey however finds himself tackled. A man appears and reaches into Grey\u2019s chest without breaking the skin and Grey blacks out.</p> <p>David wakes in a hospital to find that he can see through everyone else and no one can hear him except for one woman, Laurel. She says he is in the place in-between and that she is to be his guide until he they find and kill him or until he turns, in which case she\u2019ll kill him, any questions?</p> <p>After refusing to answer any of David\u2019s questions, only repeating what she said earlier, she takes him to see the man who answers questions, but not before seeing the same black van that Grey had seen before a seeming lifetime ago. He thinks back and it all comes back the bodies, the creatures, and the man reaching into his chest, David wonders if she is dead. Laurel says, \u2018No. Almost. But not quite. Not yet.\u2019</p> <p>Shortly, they come to an elderly man named \u2018Laz\u2019, who seems to be looking for something, but is rather mysterious about that it is, Laurel says that Arthur says Laz is looking for his death.</p> <p>Eventually, they come to a run-down part of town; David admits he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s been this way before. They walk into an old factory full of what appears to be vagrants. When they walk in everyone seems to be in awe of Laurel.</p> <p>They find Arthur, who is the one who answers questions, he tells his story as man who fell between the cracks and became part of the In-between, how he just slowly became forgotten and then invisible. When David notes that it\u2019s not the same as what happened to him. Arthur almost looks upon with pity and explains that the Goblin creatures and the Men also known as the Walkers are one and the same, that the Man that David saw reach into his chest is the same man who created the Walkers. He goes on to say that when that man reached into his chest, he took something, David Grey\u2019s soul. He approximately a year before he becomes a Walker himself.</p> <p>Laurel later explains that they must go to New York to get David\u2019s soul back, and they\u2019ll have to walk from L.A. Everyone else at the factory seems excited at the prospect of Laurel taking another on a walk. Laz joins them for a bit and explains in his own way with Laurel\u2019s help that Laz is short for Lazarus who was brought back from the dead by Jesus Christ. Apparently Jesus had requested that Laz wait for his return once he was done having supper with his twelve friends. So Laz waited, and waited, and waited. Eventually he had found that he had fallen through the cracks and was the first to find the In-between.</p> <p>They come to another cell of people who have become part of the In-between whose children were taken by the Walkers, David chooses to help get the children back and with Laurel and Laz\u2019s help he does, during the struggle one of the Walkers recognizes Laurel and calls her by name. It gives Laurel hope for him. Laz stays behind as they continue to New York.</p> <p>Just off a deserted highway they find a group of people huddled around a campfire, they introduce themselves and quickly find that this group is quite paranoid even to the extent that they refuse to leave the confines of the light made by the fire. This disgusts David who chooses to climb over the next rise and discovers that there are dozens of campfires just like the one he left, each with 6 to 8 campers around it, each just as paranoid as the last.</p> <p>One night David dreams of the freedom of being a Walker, terrorizing the people of the In-between, reveling in murder and feeling alive. He wakes up screaming. Laurel seems to know what he dreamt and says that it wasn\u2019t a dream, it was a promise.</p> <p>They quickly find that they are being followed by a Walker, Grey attacks it and Laurel goes to intervene and it says her name again and asks for help. Once the Walker is safely tied up, Laurel explains that this walker was the guy who had gotten his soul taken and taken the walk to New York just before David. The Walker explains that he saved money for his daughter for college and wanted to make sure that his family got the account number and such. Laurel mentions that it breaks the rules and that there will be repercussions, but helps him anyway. The Walker tells Grey that it would probably just be easier for him if he let Laurel kill him before New York. When Laurel asks what he said, Grey says \u2018Nothing\u2019. The Walker is quickly retrieved and slaughtered by his own.</p> <p>Weeks pass and Laurel admits that she keeps her distance from her the people she escorts because every time she sees a Walker it reminds her that she\u2019s failed over and over again. Which makes David question if she\u2019s here for him, or is he here for her. To which for the first time she has no smart-ass comeback.</p> <p>They come north to Chicago, Laurel points out that they probably lost time for it, but David says he just wanted to see the city one last time before\u2026 the truth of the matter is that David\u2019s estranged wife now lives in Chicago. He wanted to see her one last time, even if she couldn\u2019t see him.</p> <p>He enters her apartment and seems to be a ghost to her as she talks on the phone to her mother and then showers. He leaves her a note from a crumpled up piece of paper and a thrown away lipstick which reads: </p> <p>I\u2019M SORRY.</p> <p>FORGIVE ME.</p> <p>FORGET ME.</p> <p>I LOVE YOU.</p> <p>DAVID</p> <p>He returns to Laurel and tells her what happened since he kept her waiting, in her anger she explains that the Walkers are always watching and their job is not to kill David, but to break him, and easy way to do that is to kill and otherwise harm his loved ones. He gets back to her apartment to find her missing. They catch a Walker and they find out that she\u2019s been taken to an empty apartment nearby.</p> <p>David\u2019s wife, Sarah is drugged and manipulated into believing that David has abandoned her even as David and Laurel fight their way into the building. The Walkers attempt to get Sarah to commit suicide as David bursts in and attacks them. Sarah panics and runs out the fire access to the roof.</p> <p>She nearly falls off, but David is able to catch her before and she passes out. Laurel explains that he was able to touch her at all because he\u2019s beginning to tap into his abilities as a Walker to pass between the mundane world and the In-between, the more he uses them the faster they grow.</p> <p>Months later, David has a waking dream of being a Walker and attacks several innocent bystanders, Laurel stops him but only just. They make camp in a warehouse for the night and Laurel asks him if she wants to make it easier on him and simply kill him now, but he shouldn\u2019t answer right away, he has to hear the other side before making his choice. With that she walks out into the snow.</p> <p>Minutes later there is a knock on the door and David is greeted by four Walkers who grab an old radio out of their van. They set the radio down on the floor and set a chair next to it, one of the Walkers hugs him. Finally despite that it is not plugged in a voice comes out of the radio and tells David that everything he believes is a lie.</p> <p>Outside, several yards away, Laurel wants to give up. Inside, the voice offers an example, that if the Walkers wanted to, they could kill David at any time and they choose not to. Now the voice only asks that David touch the dial on the radio as a show of faith, pointing out that Laurel knew the Walkers were coming and let David meet with them anyway, knowing that he trusts her. David does so and finds himself in a very different New York. It seems to be covered in stone and wood instead of glass and steel. There standing higher up on the roof of a building is a blue skinned man with black-holes for irises, he goes on about how creation is a lie since it\u2019s built upon the promise that things will get better, he cites examples of the misery in the world. He goes on to explain that he wishes to expose the creator for the sham that he is. </p> <p>David is transported back to the warehouse and the Walkers leave. Laurel returns in the morning. Telling him not to repeat what \u2018The Other Guy\u2019 said she simply says that he needs to decide if he wants Laurel to end it there or not. David explains how once after Sarah left him, once he realized he had lost her, he put his service revolver to his head. Just as he was about to pull the trigger, a friend called and invited him to a Dodgers game. He had the receiver in one hand and his revolver in the other. He chose the baseball game; he figured that the gun was always there if he changed his mind. He decided to take his chances; just he was now, with the Other Guy and with Laurel. In that moment, Laurel took him in her arms and held him. They walked out of the warehouse together as friends. She added on that she\u2019d have to ask that question a mere two more times.</p> <p>Ten months into their walk the strain of the constant traveling along with his \u2018infection\u2019 was getting to David. They had fought their way through legions of Walkers, it came time for Laurel to ask David a second time if he wanted her to kill him here, and finally David snapped. He brutally attacked Laurel; he moved and acted very much as a Walker would. Laurel is able to talk him back to reality. David profusely apologizes for losing it. Later after he\u2019s recovered, he offers to take the remainder of the walk alone, but Laurel says it isn\u2019t allowed. She adds that no one would be around to talk David back if the madness struck again. He asks what she does when she\u2019s not escorting people to the end of the journey and she simply says that she\u2019s at peace. But unfulfilled. Empty. Waiting. But it\u2019s better than the pain.</p> <p>David stops dead in his tracks and asks who she is really, what is she? She says \u201cI\u2019m something\u2026 you could never understand, David. And I\u2019m very old. And I\u2019m very tired of walking. So let\u2019s walk.\u201d As she sleeps that night in across a campfire from him he watches her. Realizing that she hasn\u2019t smiled or laughed in months and that his company causes her pain. He decides in that moment to strive not to be a burden on her, not to cause her anymore pain than absolutely necessary because he might very well be falling in love with her.</p> <p>In the days that follow, things improve slightly, she actually makes a joke at his expense, but at least it\u2019s a joke. It is just then that in front of them that they see their path filled with Walkers. Evenly spaced along the road in a line. To get passed them David will have to fight and defeat them each one at a time and only call upon Laurel if he absolutely has to for help. Knowing that calling upon Laurel will cause her pain he attempts to go through them without calling upon her at all. He gets pretty far, but in the end he has no other option.</p> <p>Together they make it though, but both are in sore shape at the end. </p> <p>Laurel points out that the worst is not over as a figure approaches from the distance from the direction they are traveling. Laurel tells David that he must talk to him. David rightfully notes that Laurel is afraid of this guy. She quietly excuses herself and goes to a nearby cottage saying only that she\u2019s been down this road before.</p> <p>David walks to meet the figure and is shocked to see an elderly man looking just like him with slight scarring where David has fresh cuts from his all too recent ordeal. When it comes right down to it, David only has one question, he asks if he succeeds in getting his soul back the elder David says no. So David asks what happens to Laurel and the elder says \u2018We kill her after we get to New York.\u2019</p> <p>Back in the cottage, David returns and Laurel says that she never finished asking before, so knowing now what he does about what will happen, does he want her to end it now? He attempts to sidestep the question and explain his feelings for her; she won\u2019t listen and repeats the question. He lets out a quiet \u2018no\u2019 after a bit of thought. As they continue traveling he vows to himself that he won\u2019t allow her to die, no matter what just as they arrive in New York City. </p> <p>New York in the In-between is basically Hell-on-Earth.</p> <p>Everything appears to be made from stone, just as it had in David\u2019s earlier vision. They see Walkers openly selling drugs and causing misery in the In-between and in the real world.</p> <p>The \u2018Other Guy\u2019 meets them not long after they enter the city, and acknowledges that they made it there with almost a week to spare. He greets Laurel and she flinches away from him. David cuts to the chase and demands his soul back, but the Soul Stealer tells him that he has too much to learn before-hand. Without warning a large group of Walkers separate Laurel and David and carry them off to differing areas of the grounds.</p> <p>Laurel seems resigned to her fate as she\u2019s gone though this so many times before, why should this time be any different?</p> <p>David after a brief incarceration is placed in a 2x2x7 box on wheels, so that he can only stand within it. Wrought Iron bars allow him to see 3/4ths of the way around him. The Other Guy simply says the box is to protect David from himself. The Other Guy takes the occasion to explain his side more clearly.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s pretend for the moment, that you\u2019re God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd really, why not? Everybody else does. People who failed Biology 101 and Basic Physics think that they can do as good a job at designing cosmologies and platypuses and comets as the maker of all things. Vanity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut even unskilled labor might produce a better result. At least their hearts would be in the right place.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least it wouldn\u2019t be just one big tragic setup\u2026 A balloon waiting for someone to stick a pin in it and show it for the fraud it is.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cBut I digress. So. You\u2019re God.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow do you like it so far?\u201d</p> <p>David takes the chance to tell him how stupid he finds the situation as Walkers prance past him wearing angelic wings, as they near a large, dark stone pit.</p> <p>The Other Guy continues\u2026</p> <p>\u201cBefore you is the Void. The long Pre-creation hesitation, pregnant with possibilities, waiting to be born. Waiting to be.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut most of all\u2026 silent. The most profound silence imaginable. Not just without sound, but before sound.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2014\u201c</p> <p>\u201c\u2014you are alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd really, who wants to be alone all the time? Especially since time hasn\u2019t been invented yet.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible loneliness beyond description.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd even though you are\u2026 you cannon be\u2026 because there is no place for you to be in.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you create one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you\u2019re alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you can.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause is kills the time you just got around to inventing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet there be light.\u201d</p> <p>A dim light fills the stone pit and reveals Walkers within brandishing various scientific achievements, inventions, and discoveries. Fossils, atomic diagrams, models of the planets\u2026 etc. The Other Guy continues on with his monologue.</p> <p>\u201cYou slammed molecules together and blew them out into the void.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cProtons danced and wave-forms flickered. You ignited suns, nurtured nucleotides and exhaled proteins that would in time birth a Mozart and put knees of Flamingos on backward just for the variety and humor of it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs time passed \u2013 and what a handy little creation that was \u2013 you got better at it. You abandon single-celled creatures and work your way up from Protozoa to Saurians like a sculptor working his way up from a clay dog to a Mona Lisa.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo bad you have to hone your skills by killing all your failures. Even though they were innocent. Even though the fault was not theirs, but in your design. Because everything you create, dies.\u201d</p> <p>Because press releases and pamphlets notwithstanding, you\u2019re not perfect. If you were, you wouldn\u2019t have done all this\u2026 all this\u2026because you were alone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you feared the void.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you had nothing better to do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause you were bored.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou even create others like yourself, but not quite as powerful, because that would be too great a threat. At least you think you created them because one day they were just there, and since you created \u201cthere\u201d in the first place, then you must have created them, but you\u2019ve been so busy working out this whole light-to-nutrient chlorophyll thing that you really can\u2019t remember doing it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut then, neither can they.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou tell them all you\u2019re trying to create a better world. But if you\u2019re as perfect as your biographers maintain, they why didn\u2019t you get it right the first time?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy\u2019d you screw up?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSome of those around you ask just that question. You don\u2019t like questions. Just obedience.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut the questions continue. You try to stop them. You can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then it\u2019s war. A war of misery. A war about misery.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUnderstand: Anyone would get bored doing nothing but designing worlds for eternity. You want to be entertained, and every author needs conflict.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you introduce misery into an equation predicated on what was supposed to be one simple proposition: The hope that tomorrow will be better than today.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHave things gotten better? Are they continuing to get better? Is the promise valid? Or is the promise a lie?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMoney is not the root of all evil. Misery is. Misery starts wars, kills children, destroys souls. Misery proves the universe is uncaring and random and cruel. Misery proves that creation is a lie.\u201d</p> <p>David pointedly asks: \u201cEven if you\u2019re the one causing it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe all cause it. You caused your share. You\u2019ve seen that on the way here. Even with the best intentions, never meaning anyone harm\u2026 you\u2019ve hurt people you loved and turned your back on others.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re still missing the point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re God. Everything that is, you made. So why not just leave misery out of the equation in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist naturally. Nothing does. Everything had to be created. Why go out of your way to create misery?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s what this is about. That\u2019s what the war is about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemoving misery from the equation.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRemoving loneliness. Removing pain. Removing guilt and longing and fear and regret.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd removing those who would profit from it. Those who would feed it. Those who need it to feel they have a purpose.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no Hell. There is no Heaven. No beyond to fear. No final exhalation of stars.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is only the cycle of life and death repeated infinitely.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou come, you go, you come, you go, dying into instantaneous rebirth and birthing into inevitable death. And in all of it, your misery increases. More people, less food, more technology, less privacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBombs and Anthrax and Ebola, terror in the streets, doors locked against neighbors and anonymous crime, against community and each other. Mothers drowning their children because they can\u2019t handle the stress of the very act of creation itself. They understand that what they bring in will know only misery so they end it, end it for themselves, for their children. They get it over with.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTime for the children to return the favor. Time to overturn creation and start again. But how?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou do it be accelerating the misery, revealing it for what it is, the primal flaw in creation\u2019s design. Once there was only Lazarus, the first to fall between the cracks and be forgotten. More have come through every day, and every day that lie stands more and more revealed, the flaw in creation\u2019s design becomes more evident, and finally everyone is on this side of the equation, not on the other side. My side. Not his side.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd then\u2026 then it\u2019s our turn to design a world of our own. A world without guilt, only pleasure. Without pain, only joy. Without limits. Utter absolute freedom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFeel the misery of the world, David Grey. For one second, I\u2019m going to open your mind to the song of pain, the song I have been forced to hear every day and every night to the last syllable of recorded time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFor just one fleeting second, David, feel the totality of the suffering and pain and misery of a world made deliberately flawed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd tell me the truth. Tell me honestly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs this not a world that deserves to be put out of it\u2019s misery?\u201d</p> <p>David experiences the pain, agony, and misery in imagery that is forced into his brain and it drives him insane.</p> <p>Laurel hears David\u2019s cry of pain and she\u2019s knows exactly what has occurred. She looks to a couple of Walkers and they have tears in her their eyes. Prepared she is escorted to the Other Guy who says nothing so she continues on and finds David hunched over like the Walkers, he bears the marks all over his body as well and he looks at her hungrily as she pleads with him to listen and stay in the room with him.</p> <p>David in his insanity and rage remember that killing her is the very last thing he wants so he bolts from the room to protect her. His instinct is to run into the night.</p> <p>The Other Guy has some Walkers prepare \u201cThe Wheel\u201d, a large flat, but round wooden table top, the Walkers reveal metal spikes and Laurel is escorted to it to cleanse herself as David runs free.</p> <p>After her bath, she is given a sparse meal and then she is carried without resistance to \u201cThe Wheel\u201d. David, while running with a pack of Walkers sees a mannequin that reminds him of Laurel. He remembers everything they shared over the past year and realizes that somewhere along the way he fell in love with her, and that he has to help her.</p> <p>He sprints back to the Other Guy\u2019s domicile and finds Laurel nailed to The Wheel. (similar to a crucifixion) The Other Guy says that Laurel will die and there\u2019s nothing David can do to stop it, he can only affect how and why she dies. So he need not bother trying to save her, reminding him that he came for his soul, not for her.</p> <p>The Soul Stealer tells David that he needn\u2019t worry so much over Laurel since she\u2019s not even human anyway he shows David her true form, she appears as an energetic radiating feminine form. He goes to explain that she only comes to Earth when someone has been touched as he had touched David, he also says that every one who works in his service has regained their soul, the markings remain to signify that they are his property. Because without a soul, you belong nowhere. The deadline in important because if you go a year without regaining your soul you would be trapped between the two worlds, not fully in one or the other. Without a soul you are no use to either side, his or God\u2019s, because you cannot choose. His soul is the coin he brings to the bargaining table, they want to make sure you have it in hand when it comes time.</p> <p>So, the choice is this: David can have his soul back and he would retain the markings of a Walker and remain in his service, but he would be whole again, he would live as long as the Other Guy does and when he no longer required his service his life would be his own. Or, He could give his soul to Laurel and end her cycle of pain, for she is not human and quite soulless. But, with a soul she could be born as any human would and live in hope and misery for a lifetime as any other human. But if he gives his soul to her, he will forever be a wanderer, trapped between worlds, the markings would fade, and he would no longer belong to the Other Guy, he would not belong anywhere. Today. Tomorrow. To the end of time itself.</p> <p>Choose.</p> <p>David looks upon the Walkers with disgust and pity. The Other Guy tells David not to perpetuate the lie any further, reminding him how hard he fought to regain his soul.</p> <p>David takes his soul into his hand (it appears as a small blue flame) and looks upon it and looks to the Walkers and then to the Other Guy, then to Laurel.</p> <p>He walks to her as she hang there dying. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Laurel. I came all this way\u2014\u201c she cuts him off. \u201cI know\u2026 I forgive you, David.\u201d He continues. \u201c\u2014but I guess I put you through all this for nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Laurel manages eye contact in her pain. \u201c\u2026Nothing\u2026?\u201d </p> <p>David leans in close and whispers. \u201cI love you.\u201d</p> <p>With that he pushes his soul within her breast and a blue flash of light explodes from her and her angelic form soars up into the sky and shines like a beacon.</p> <p>All over the world, people in the In-between see the sign they have been waiting for, and for the first time experience true hope. Arthur, tears streaming down his face finds that people can see him. The people around the campfires at the beginning of the journey see it and smile. The Walkers look on in awe. And the Other Guy simply looks. He walks over to the rapidly fading body of David who is shivering and wondering why it is so cold. As he fades view the Other Guy simply notes, \u201cWell. I certainly didn\u2019t see that coming.\u201d</p> <p>As Laurel returns to her place of peace she speaks with the voice that originally summoned her a year ago. She wants to make sure that David knew she loved him and that he had a lovely soul. The last thing she says is that she can feel her heart beating.</p> <p>David finds himself in tattered clothes on a street, but no markings. Everyone can see him on both sides of the metaphor. He is recognized as a LAPD Detective who went missing about a year ago.</p> <p>Sarah is at the hospital when he recovers, after he gets over the shock of what happens and doesn\u2019t tell her about Laurel and says that he can only remember walking, she tells him about her experience in Chicago, how she knew he was there and he somehow saved her, though she barely remembers it through a drug induced haze. But she realized that she had to find him. Alive or dead.</p> <p>As they are leaving the hospital there is a newborn baby in a room they pass. The mother mentions that they had already chosen a name for her, but the moment she looked into her eyes she could only name her Laurel.</p> <p>As David and Sarah leave the hospital, David is confronted with some of the people of the In-between who hadn\u2019t crossed over, they ask that he speak for them. He says he\u2019ll try his best.</p> <p>Epilogue</p> <p>Years have passed, David finds himself on the same road where he met himself several years earlier and has the exact same conversation. </p> <p>David walks to meet the figure and is shocked to see an elderly man looking just like him with slight scarring where David has fresh cuts from his all too recent ordeal. When it comes right down to it, David only has one question, he asks if he succeeds in getting his soul back the elder David says no. So David asks what happens to Laurel and the elder says \u2018We kill her after we get to New York.\u2019</p> <p>The elder David walks back to a car waiting for him with Laz behind the wheel. When David asks how that worked exactly, Laz simply says that he has connections. Laz tells David that he should cheer up because he\u2019s a hero. David says that he doesn\u2019t feel very much like a hero. Laz points out that the trouble with being a hero is that you\u2019re expected to make these sacrifices and save people and expect nothing in return. David has helped a lot of people on both sides of the metaphor over the years, given a lot of people hope. While a lot of people have thanked him for it the one person who David cared to hear it from never had the chance to say it.</p> <p>With that he drops off David nowhere near where he picked him up. So David walks to a nearby park and sit and enjoys the weather. After several minutes he hears a voice of a young girl asking if he\u2019s okay. He says he\u2019s okay and looks up to see Laurel as a young teenager wearing a tee-shirt that says \u201cAngel\u201d. Her mother calls her and tells her they\u2019re going to be late. Laurel turns to leave but she stops and smiles at David and simply says \u201cThank you.\u201d</p> <p>David is moved to tears and watches her go. He gets a call on his walkie-talkie asking for assistance. He tells him he\u2019ll be there. And then says \u201cI\u2019ll always be there.\u201d To himself.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>In the Beginning</h2><p>Before Humans were the predominant race on the Earth, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> came to the Earth to implant this new planet with one of their eggs. Advanced beyond what most races can even comprehend Celestials reproduce by locating planets which are still in their infancy, and use the planet simultaneously as a surrogate mother and as a source of nourishment for their young. The planet is given deposits of the ore <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vibranium/18-40919/\">Vibranium</a> which will eventually act as a cancer overtaking the world and its inhabitants and converting energy into nourishment for the egg. The gestation process alone takes thousands of years, and the Celestials have enemy races that would destroy their young. To prevent other races from destroying their young they take the Earth's dominant life-form, an early version of man, and bio-engineer a portion of the population to act as a sentient immune system for the dormant Celestial. From early man the Celestials created the race of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deviants/65-13345/\">Deviants</a>, a race whose aggression was to be suitable to make them defend their planet from any invaders, hostile or otherwise, and by doing so inadvertently protect and maintain the Celestial Egg. The Deviants, however, contained far too much aggression. They became a destructive race, endangering the balance and the safety of the Egg. In order to maintain balance and prevent the Deviants from destroying the planet, the Celestials created the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eternals/65-13344/\">Eternals</a>, a race who would be engineered to become the antithesis of the Deviant life-forms on Earth.</p><p>The Celestials saw that the conflict between the Eternals and Deviants would mean the mutually assured destruction of both races leaving the Egg once again unprotected. The Celestials would then tamper with the remainder of the Human race, not to create another race immediatly, but this time to plant a genetic seed within the growing human race. The purpose of this \"Celestial Seed\" within the Human race would be two-fold. First of all the human race would blossom and evolve in a pre-determined pattern to suit the Celestials needs. This process of development would follow the natural course of Human evolution, allowing Humans to live and grow isolated from the conflict of the Eternals and Deviants. It wouldn't be until after the Eternals and Deviants had outlived their usefulness when the seed implanted within the race would bloom, allowing humans to pick up the job of being the Egg's primary defense against the outside world. The second thing that this genetic seed would do is influence the actions of the human race such that individual members would fulfill a much greater roll in the protection of the egg than any one could understand. The implications of this are far-reaching because this seed could have bearing on every act and decision made by any humans on Earth. In the mountains high above the still-evolving human race, Eternals would be seen as gods and worshipped, while the Deviants below would be feared as devils and demons. The Celestials would make an agreement with the remaining life-forms of the Earth that would grow to be worshipped as other gods of the Human race not to interfere.</p><p>The first enemy of the Celestials to show interest in the Human race would be the alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/12-43140/\">Kree</a>. Taking a small subset of the population for genetic research, the Kree would work to enhance and speed up the evolution of Humans in order to create a new race of living weapons for use against the Celestials, the Inhumans. Not desiring to be pawns of the Kree, the Inhumans grew powerful and became independent of their creators. Living in the sanctuary of their hidden city of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/attilan/34-44155/\">Attilan</a>, the Inhumans would remain Isolated from the Human race for much of their development.</p><p>Along with the inhabitants of Earth which were designed to protect the Celestial Egg, the Celestials would appoint a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-watchers/65-11523/\">The Watchers</a> to keep watch over the planet and record the events which occur. The Watchers had entered into an agreement with the Celestials long ago, and remained tasked with the duty of watching the planets which house Celestial Eggs. The watcher of Earth <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watcher/29-7120/\">Watcher</a>, would be stationed on the Earth's moon where he could observe, only interfering in order to maintain the Celestial's greater plans for the Earth.</p><p>As the Human race would grow and develop, variations on would slowly begin to crop up. Often triggered by outside influence such as secret formulas, genetic manipulation, or radiation various individuals would develop powers and abilities that would set themselves apart from the rest of their species. These mutations and evolutionary jumps would not be the result of accident or nature as man would come to believe, but the triggering of the Celestial Seed whose germination inside individual humans would manifest as the powers and abilities of some of these individuals. Some of the manifestations of the awakened Celestial seed within mankind would include <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> created by a scientist during World War II whose mutation was triggered by a secret formula developed to create super soldiers, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> whose mutation was triggered by cosmic radiation, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> whose mutation was triggered by the bite of a radioactive spider, the Incredible <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> whose mutation was triggered by gama radiation, and finally <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant/12-40656/\">Mutant</a> whose mutation was seemingly the natural course of the species' evolution. Humans would regard these changes as acts of god or science, remaining ignorant to the Celestial's plans and tampering.</p><h2>Inhuman Earth</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>'s brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maximus/29-3447/\">Maximus</a> creates a weapon based on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">Terrigen Mists</a> to turn the population of Earth into a super-powered population that he could rule as king. The Inhuman Royal Family was trapped with the exception of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lockjaw/29-3534/\">Lockjaw</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>, and Black Bolt. Maximus killed Lockjaw sending his brother into a rage that caused him to kill Maximus. It was around this time the Inhuman population began to grow tired of hiding from the less powerful human race within the walls of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/attilan/34-44155/\">Attilan</a>. Ignoring the warnings posed by the Royal Council that they could not survive the pollutant and pathogen saturated environment of the Earth, the Inhumans left the sanctuary of Attilan to live amongst the humans. Mistaken for mutants the Inhumans were persecuted and murdered. Weakened and sick from the Earth's contaminated atmosphere, the once powerful Inhumans were unable to fight back. Black Bolt and the rest of the Royal Family were preparing to leave the Earth for good, but Black Bolt could not leave his people under these conditions. Setting off Maximus' weapon, the Terrigen Mists were released into the Earth's atmosphere. Mixing with the contaminants and pollutants that already existed in the atmosphere the Terrigen Mists were transformed into a form that was not harmful to humans and simultaneously altered the Earth's atmospheric pollution safe for the Inhuman population of Earth. The new Terrigen Mist-altered atmosphere of Earth would mutate the human population of the Earth granting everyone super-powers as well as enhancing the mutations of the Inhuman population. Most likely having some idea of the purpose of the Earth's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-watchers/65-11523/\">The Watchers</a>, before setting off Maximus' bomb Black Bolt snuck into the home of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watcher/29-7120/\">Watcher</a> to blind him. Blinded, Uatu would not be able to see or record the events that transpired around the mutation of the Earth's population or any other events in his sector for the next ten years. Human Mutants and other previously super-powered individuals would have already had their Celestial Seed germinated and would be spared further mutation by the Terrigen Mists.</p><p>Meanwhile <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a> was using the Earth's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vibranium/18-40919/\">Vibranium</a> deposits to develop a network of power centers to solve the Earth's energy problems. He had hoped to use vibranium convert certain minerals native to the Earth into sound energy which could be relayed around the Earth through receptive towers. A problem with one of his reactors would create a chain reaction of explosions around the world. The mutation of the Earth's population would be blamed on Richards' experiments (and Reed would be particularly hard on himself). Reed believed that the fallout of the explosions was instantly beamed around the world thought the network of transmission towers which were already in operation.</p><h2>Fall of the Heroes</h2><p>In the years after the release of the Terrigen Mists the lives of the world's original super-heroes would change dramatically. With global food shortages on the rise, the sea was turned to for a food source. The United Nations would meet concerning the food supply, but would exclude <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> believing that he would voice against using the oceans to feed the mainland countries. Knowing that controlling the world's food supply would mean controlling the world, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> approached an angry Namor and convinced him to help attack the United Nations. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> would be the first to respond to the threat. Against Captain America's warnings <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a> attempted to subdue Namor and who broke his neck. Seeing his uncle killed pushed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a> over the edge. Franklin told Namor that he wanted him to burn and never stop. The entire left half of Namor's body would burst into flames that even diving back into the ocean could not extinguish. The Fantastic Four would then turn on Doom, blaming him for Johnny's death. Doom started to tell Reed that he knew what actually caused the mutations and that he had a cure. Before Doom could explain himself to Reed, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> chased after Doom. A nearby explosion killed both Doom and Sue, leaving Reed to never know what Doom actually meant.</p><p>After Sue's death Reed became reclusive and eccentric. Not only was his wife gone, but he continued to blame himself for not only the grotesque mutation of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> but of the entire world. Trying to discover the secret Doom hinted to, Reed chose to move into Doom's castle in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a>. So that Doom's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doombots/29-11924/\">Doombots</a> would not see him as an intruder Reed chose to don one of Doom's old costumes. Unknowing of what happened to their leader, Reed continued to act as ruler of Latveria in Doom's stead. The superstitious Latverian population would come to believe that something was wrong with their leader, but never to understand the truth. Obsessed only with curing the world, Reed stopped using his powers.</p><p>Reed's leaving the Fantastic Four caused the group to break up completely. Ben Grimm would go on to marry his long-time girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alicia-masters/29-4337/\">Alicia Masters</a>, whose Terrigen Mist mutation would allow her animate her sculptures, creating mindless clay servants. Together the two would have two boys: Buzz and Chuck, both with mutations that resemble their father's. The family would take up a quite life in New York.</p><p>The Fantastic Four would not be the only super-heroes that felt the toll of time. The Hulk would marry <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/betty-banner/29-10870/\">Betty Banner</a> and she would die of radiation poisoning from exposure to the Hulk's enemies. While they radiated the gamma energy that created them, the Hulk would continue absorbing energy. This would account for the many forms that the Hulk. As Hulk continued to absorb ambient gamma energy the Celestial Seed within him began to seek independence from its host, something that had never occurred before. Banner's physical form would result in two separate entities similar to his psyche. The human side of his personality created the form of a child-like version of Bruce known as Banner. Banner retained Bruce's intelligence and personality, but was blind. The Hulk aspect of his personality took a form resembling the original Hulk, but while large and green took a more ape-like appearance. This form of the Hulk had no mind or soul of its own. Banner controlled Hulk's actions, but was also dependent on the Hulk because the blind Banner saw through the Hulk's eyes. Banner would ride the Hulk and symbolic of the pair's relationship all of Bruce's life the pair would be inseparable.</p><p>Captain America would finally defeat and kill his archenemy the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a>, and after doing so believed himself unfit to continue being a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and left the team. The years have not been kind to Steve Rogers (often still referred to as \"Cap\" by former friends and teammates). He has become older, bitter, and angry. Still acting as a vigilante, Cap's is often viewed as a relic and having lost some of his sanity. Cap's costume has broken down over the years with only his pants and boots remaining. Still using his shield as a weapon and draped in an old American flag, Cap is somewhere between a hero and a joke.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a> would join the NYPD. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> no longer saw any reason to protect a population that could just as easily protect itself and quit being Spider-Man (Mary Jane had died). His former secret identity is no longer a secret. At some point his daughter May acquired the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/symbiote/12-42358/\">Symbiote</a> and would take his place as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-girl/29-3365/\">Spider-Girl</a>. May believed that she was now in control of Venom but Peter was skeptical causing even more strain in their relationship. The original Daredevil is no where to be found in this alternate future. In his stead is a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> who is a circus performer. Daredevil is unable to be hurt. Either feeling no pain or enjoying pain, he allows himself to be shot, stabbed, blown up, crushed, or anything else he believes will please his audiences. Working with a group of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant/12-40656/\">Mutant</a>, they entertain night after night always seeking larger audiences and grander spectacles.</p><p>Benny Beckley (the son of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/comet-man/29-10953/\">Comet Man</a>) would manifest his powers around the time of the release of the Terrigen Mists. He became a powerful telepath capable of controlling the actions (by controlling the mind) of anyone he comes near. The manifestation of Beckley's powers would create a wave of pure psychic energy that killed all of the world's telepaths including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>. He would go on to call himself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-skull/29-10954/\">The Skull</a> and adopt a red variation on the Punisher's symbol.</p><p>With Professor Xavier gone the X-Men are broken up. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> was thought to have lost her powers before the manifestation of the Skull which saved her from the psychic fallout of the Skull's powers. In reality Jean had died when the Skull manifested his powers and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> took over her identity. Pryor married Wolverine and the two live together. Have adopted a rather sedentary lifestyle they have become overweight and unhappy together. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> has attempted to adopt a more normal life, lamenting losing Jean to Wolverine. His brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a> as well as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a> have joined the space pirate team of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">Starjammers</a> with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsair/29-7591/\">Corsair</a> and continually attempt to convince Scott to leave the Earth with them. Never wanting to leave Jean alone on Earth, Scott remains. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> has become stuck in his ice form. Now in danger of melting in warmer climates, Iceman lives in relative solitude at the north pole where he can remain in sub-zero temperatures. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> lost his fortune and had adopted a life of philanthropy becoming a \"guardian angel\". His vast wealth and position of power was always a constant worry for Warren, and ironically it took him losing everything he once valued to find happiness for the first time. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> left America and is married to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>. The two rule over Africa. The Black Panther had mutated into a humanoid panther after exposure to the Terrigen Mists. Beast is now a member of Storm and the Black Panther's court. Other than his fur turning white, there appears to be little difference between his current and future self.</p><p>Besides Cap <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> are some of the few surviving members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>. Thor's brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> had tricked their father <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/odin/29-3507/\">Odin</a> into believing that Thor needed a punishment to humble him, and Odin turned Thor into a Woman. Thor remains on Earth because leaving for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> to show Odin what really happened would mean leaving the Earth unprotected and vulnerable to Loki's trickery. Iron Man has locked himself away in a sterilized environment. He is permanently connected to his machinery. With the other Avengers dead, Stark has built robotic homages to his fallen comrades known as the Iron Avengers. The team he commands consists of the Vision and robotic versions of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>. An alien plague known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hydra/65-3480/\">Hydra</a> has also overcome sections of New York. Where the Hydra of modern time is simply an annoyance to many heroes, the Hydra alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/symbiote/12-42358/\">Symbiote</a> attaches itself to its hosts and controls their minds, linking them to a de-centralized hive-mind. Cap's former partner the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a> is one of the many that are controlled by Hydra. Along with protecting New York from conventional threats, the Iron Avengers are tasked with the duty of containing the Hydra infection by destroying the infected when they are found.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a> has become the emperor of Japan, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> has become ruler of Russia. With worldwide food shortages, Russia has become an important entity providing a large percentage of the world's food. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/29-7477/\">Captain Britain</a> rules England and has been entrusted with the care of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> son. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">Green Goblin</a> has become the President of America. He has reached an agreement with Tony Stark to use the Iron Avengers for enforcement.</p><h2>A New Watcher</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watcher/29-7120/\">Watcher</a> has been blinded for approximately ten years. He has not witnessed or recorded any of the events since Black Bolt secretly blinded him and released the Terrigen Mists into the Earths atmosphere. Knowing that his job must be done by someone, the Watcher teleports the robot Aaron Stack (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/machine-man/29-7242/\">Machine Man</a>) to his home on the moon. While doing so, he took away Aaron's face and appearance by making his exterior transparent revealing the mechanical workings of his inner body. The Watcher's hope is to break Aaron's spirit. Aaron has lived his life as a man--with programming created by his father Able designed to replicate the flaws, emotions, and curiosity of a human. The Watcher knows that in order to do the job of a Watcher one must lose their emotional attachments to those that he watches or he cannot succeed in his job. Being seen only through a large screen, the Watcher explains to Stack that his job is to record all events on Earth and that since someone needs to do his job he has located Aaron, the only person on Earth capable of watching everything at once. He refers to Aaron as his model number X-51 to try to further impart upon him that he is not a man and is only a machine. Uatu explains to Aaron a brief version of the history of the Earth carefully leaving out certain facts about the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> that he believes an emotional X-51 is not prepared to handle. Without divulging the existence of the celestial egg, he leads X-51 to believe that the evolution of mankind based on the Celestial seed within man was not to protect the Earth, but to instead guide human evolution to the point where humans will evolve into Celestials themselves.</p><p>After showing X-51 how to operate the Watcher's machinery, X-51 begins to simultaneously piece together for the Watcher the events that transpired since the release of the Terrigen Mists by viewing all electronic data saved on the history of the Earth and to watch and record events as they continue to transpire in the present.</p><h2>Rise of the Skull</h2><p>X-51 moves his attention to Cap and the Skull. Capable to control the minds of anyone that comes in contact with him <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-skull/29-10954/\">The Skull</a> is able to build up an army. Anyone that threatens his safety or reign simply becomes another pawn. He has fashioned a throne out of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a>'s body and armor which his servants move for him. At some point even Namor had become one of his slaves. Still in a permanent state of flame, Namor is forced to collect food from the oceans to feed the Skull's army. Other important members include the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-maiden/29-10968/\">Iron Maiden</a> and Spiders-Man. Iron Maiden was involved in an accident with a silver acid compound. The compound coated her body and along with enhanced strength and flight she is able to turn her body into any form of weapon she desires including blast weapons. She acts as the Skull's primary body guard. Spiders-Man gained his powers by the Terrigen Mists. His appearance is similar to that of Spider-Man's old costume, and he wears a tattered cloak to hide his disfigured appearance. Spiders-Man has the power to weave web-like illusions casting whatever he wants someone to see-from their dreams come true to their worst nightmares.</p><p>While fighting Hydra in New York with his partner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wyatt-wingfoot/29-10275/\">Wyatt Wingfoot</a>, Cap discovers a shard of fabric with the Skull's symbol on it. Horrified that someone else has taken the mantle of the Red Skull, Cap sets out to locate the Skull and to take him down. When he finds the Skull's camp he sees first hand the magnitude of the Skull's domination over the people. The Skull has taken the will of an army of former super-heroes and villains that are forced to do his bidding. Wyatt finds that he is unable to move under his own free will any longer as the Skull has taken over his body. The Skull calls out Cap, and Cap begins to try to talk the Skull down. The Skull explains to Cap that he is helping the people he is taking over by giving them some purpose. Rather than taking over control of Cap the Skull does not see him as worth using. Instead he has his army beat Cap physically and pelt him with rocks. More depressed and ready to give up than ever, Cap contemplates giving up hope.</p><h2>Back to Earth</h2><p>While Cap is trying to uncover the secret of the Skull, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> are just returning from a venture into deep space. The Inhumans have discovered some disconcerting information about the possible future of the Earth. They have located a planet far from our own that was destroyed along with all of its inhabitants. They identified survivors of this planet which they were unable to save. These survivors were being killed by a cancerous infection of an alloy that can be found in certain areas on the Earth--<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vibranium/18-40919/\">Vibranium</a>. Upon returning to the Earth, they seek out a man who they believe is intelligent enough to help them find what is the problem--<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>. They first find the apartment of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> and family. Ben and Alicia serve the Inhuman royalty dinner while Ben explains to them the events that occurred in their absence including the downfall of Mr. Fantastic. Ben remarks that Reed just doesn't feel like a hero anymore. After learning what has become of Richards, the Inhumans travel to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>'s castle in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a> where Reed explains to them what happened to the human population in their absence. They use the head adorning horn of the deceased Royal Family member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lockjaw/29-3534/\">Lockjaw</a> to teleport around the world instantaneously. He explains of how his experiments with vibranium as an energy source ended in a catastrophic series of explosions and how it was this disaster that caused the mutation of the Earth's population.</p><p>The Inhumans listen to Reed's story, unknowing that it was their king <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a> who detonated Maximus' device who altered the Earth's population rather than Reed's experiments. Because this is her first exposure to the Mists <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luna/29-10962/\">Luna</a>, daughter of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a> begins to mutate and change. The rest of the Royal family had already mutated farther than originally. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>'s prehensile hair now covers most of her face. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karnak/29-10975/\">Karnak</a> has become smaller in stature and withered. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gorgon/29-4330/\">Gorgon</a> has taken on even more animal appearances including fur, an elongated snout, and horns. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/triton/29-11428/\">Triton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a> have evolved in appearance and power as well. Triton is now longer and more snake like looking more like a sea monster than ever. The Inhumans explain their discovery of the vibranium destroyed planet to Reed, along with the discovery of that planet's life forms who resemble the Earth's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eternals/65-13344/\">Eternals</a> both genetically and otherwise. After dwelling on Reed's story the Inhumans discuss Richards' hypothesis, and Karnak voices concern. Karnak's power is to discern flaws, physical or otherwise in opponents, structures, and anything else he comes in contact with. He states that Reed's hypothesis on how his doomed experiment caused the entire population to change was perfect-too perfect. Any such sequence of events must have some small flaw in it. Reed's explanation contained no such flaw and therefore was unbelievable.</p><p>The Inhumans desire to locate the members of their population on Earth now that they have returned. Reed comes up with an answer in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a> technology. Cerebro was once calibrated and used by Xavier to view a population and to help sort out which are humans and which are Inhuman based on their genetic signals. Reed believed that since the entire population was now mutant that all it would take would be to reverse the calibration of Cerebro to locate anyone who was not mutant, and would therefore be Inhuman. Reed borrows Lockjaw's horn from the Inhumans to locate Cerebro and make the modifications necessary to locate their people. As Reed leaves the Doombots believe the Inhumans to be invaders and begin to attack. Meanwhile Reed first teleports to the ruins of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> in Westchester where he locates the Cerebro helmet, and then to New York to the home of his friend and former treammate Ben Grimm.</p><h2>New X-Men</h2><p>A confused and lonely Cap sits while the Skull's army prepares around him. He contemplates his position and how perhaps things are as futile as the Skull says. Cap's salvation comes just soon enough in the form of the circus performer, the Daredevil. Cap is reluctant to accept Daredevil's assistance against the Skull. First he is skeptical of Daredevil as he is a performer that seeks to have his audience blow him up and shoot him. Secondly, Cap explains to Daredevil that his history with partners is not good as all of his past partners have been either killed or taken over. Daredevil explains that this is the reason he wants to join Cap's cause. Joining forces with Cap, Cap sends Daredevil's mutant circus performers to New York to locate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> for training in the use of their powers for combat.</p><p>The mutants find Cyclops in Central Park. They launch an attack on an unknowing Cyclops in order to prove to their possible mentor that they already know how to fight. The experienced former X-Men leader is able to easily take down the team including an illusion caster, a giant, a Beast-like acrobat, a flying mermaid, and a two-headed man. Defeated, they explain their intentions to Cyclops and that it was Captain America that sent them to him for training. Wanting to help out his old friend, Cyclops agrees to train the mutants and begins their training in an impromptu <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a> in an abandoned warehouse. Scott outfits the team in X-Men like uniforms for their training, asks to be called Mr. S, and begins their training as their new leader.</p><h2>Learning the Truth</h2><p>Back in New York Ben guides Reed to a back room where he had stored many of his machines from his tenure as Mr. Fantastic. When Professor Xavier was alive Reed had mapped out his brain, and needed the schematics that he had stored. When he found the scan of Xavier's brain Reed realized that it was a certain enlarged region of the Professor's brain which allowed him to access his telepathy. Using his ability to stretch for the first time in years Reed stretches his brain to match the schematics of Xavier's to create his own telepathic abilities. Now that Reed is able to use the Cerebro helmet as Xavier once did he goes outside to test out his modifications to the helmet and himself. Richards uses the helmet on the general public. To his immense surprise where the Inhumans it locates where supposed to be few, all of the Earth's mutated population was registering as Inhuman. The people of Earth had not been turned into Mutants, they were somehow turned into Inhumans.</p><h2>The Search for Mar-Vell</h2><p>Banner had been having strange dreams involving the nature of the universe, and the deceased hero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a>. He had remembered that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> had once told him that everything had a realm, including death. Banner hoped that Strange could guide him to the realm of death in order to ask Marvel personally about the dreams he had been having. Upon reaching Doctor Strange's house he found Strange's student and lover <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clea/29-2216/\">Clea</a>. Clea told Banner that while Strange's body is still living, his soul has been lost to him. She said that despite her resources, she has not been able to find any magic that could bring Strange's soul back to him or find out exactly what had happened to him. Doctor Strange's faithful friend and servant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wong/29-2215/\">Wong</a> now served Clea, aiding her as the current sorcerer supreme. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> had also agreed to accompany Banner on his quest as a protector from whatever Banner and Hulk would face in the realm of death.</p><p>It is noteworthy, that after Mar-Vell and his army of sorts defeat Death itself, (leaving no death or rest for the suffering in hospitals and such), Mar-Vell decides to restore Death itself, but remains alive himself, and when asked where he is going after the story's climatic finale, the character replies \"Someplace better\" in a physical form on the plane of the living.</p><h2>Issue Checklist</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-x/49-6354/\">Earth X</a> #0</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-x/49-6354/\">Earth X</a> #\u00bd</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-x/49-6354/\">Earth X</a> #1-12</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-x/49-6354/\">Earth X</a> #X</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-x/49-6354/\">Earth X</a> Sketchbook</li></ul><h2>Related Story-Archs</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/universe-x/39-44816/\">Universe X</a> - Story-arch that occurs after the events of Earth X and chronicles the next chapter in the history of Earth.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradise-x/39-44817/\">Paradise X</a> - Final installment of the Earth X series.

        "description":"<p>The Formation of the Fear Lords</p><p>=======</p><p>Beginning in <a href=\"/doctor-strange-sorcerer-supreme/49-4049/\">Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme</a> issue 31, the <a href=\"/dweller-in-darkness/29-13999/\">Dweller In Darkness</a> is seen sitting at a table in his Halls of Fear with what is soon recognized as the <a href=\"/fear-lords/65-28159/\">Fear Lords</a>.  He explains to them that he has summoned them, <a href=\"/kkallakku/29-44282/\">Kkallakku</a>, <a href=\"/nox/29-27793/\">Nox</a>, <a href=\"/nightmare/29-2646/\">Nightmare</a>, D'Spayre, the <a href=\"/lurking-unknown/29-27818/\">Lurking Unknown</a>, and <a href=\"/straw-man/29-44252/\">Straw Man</a>, because they are the greatest inducers of fear the universe has known.  He then explains his plan to them, that they are to take over the planet earth!  The members, save for the Lurking Unknown, then passed around their backgrounds, and told of their defeats at the hands of various earth heroes, such as <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>.  When all was said and done, Straw Man warned the others against going after earth, claiming that he saw it as a home, when he in fact was a guardian of earth mortals.  After making his warning, Straw Man exited the Halls of Fear.</p><p>Straw Man's Betrayal</p><p>=======</p><p>After leaving the Halls of Fear, Straw Man proceede to inform Dr. Strange of the Fear Lords' imminant strike.  When Straw Man finished telling Dr. Strange and <a href=\"/clea/29-2216/\">Clea</a> of the plot, the Lurking Unknown set fire to Straw Man, incinerating his physical body near instantly.  Although it seemed Straw Man was dead, his spiritual essence had in fact been transported back into his painted dimension.  Although the Lurking Fear was truly in his element of fear, Dr. Strange and Clea still proved to be too much for him, and defeated him quickly.</p><p>One Down...</p><p>=======</p><p>After the Lurking Unknown's defeat, we see the Dweller In Darkness thinking to himself, pondering over his next movement of action, now that his plan was underway and, as he stated, \"One down.\"  Nox then attacked the city near Dr. Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum.  Using the citizens' fear, she resurrected her two god-sons, <a href=\"/deimos/29-27796/\">Deimos</a> and <a href=\"/phobos/29-27794/\">Phobos</a>.  Kkallakku then took advantage of the fear that Nox was causing and attacked with his <a href=\"/fear-eaters/29-27797/\">Fear Eaters</a>.  Dr. Strange had encountered the Kkallakki before, and knew their strengths and weaknesses.  Using his knowledge of the alien race, he cast a spell to draw the fear of all the people into himself, and lured the Fear Eaters, along with Kkallakku, into a portal to another dimension.  After they were through, he utilized his dimension-distorted minimal size to sneak past the Fear Eaters and back through the portal, where, on the other side, he sealed it shut, trapping the Fear Eaters on the other side.  In the meantime, Clea and <a href=\"/rintrah/29-14794/\">Rintrah</a> broke free from the clutches of Deimos and Phobos, and dispatched of them.  Nox, again distressed by the deaths of her sons, escaped through a dimensional portal.  Afterwards, we again see the Dweller In Darkness speaking to himself, saying \"That's another two down, now to get rid of Nightmare and D'Spayre...\",  but this time, Nightmare was listening to the Dweller.  Dr. Strange was also listening, thus the Dweller's plans of secrecy were destroyed.</p><p>D'Spayre's Game</p><p>=======</p><p>D'Spayre went to Nightmare, believing his power was greater than that of the Dweller, and offered his assistance to him.  The two the began their reign of terror over the citizens of earth.  The Dweller In Darkness saw this as a challenge to prove who was more powerful, and began instilling his own fear into the mortals.  But when the three Fear Lords put all of their efoort into the Fear, the humans began to forget their fear and know only despair.  When this happened, Nightmare and the Dweller began to lose their power, and D'Spayre grew in power to a near omnipotent state.  Realizing what had happened, the Dweller and Nightmare escaped.  Gathering their strength, Dr. Strange, Rintrah, Clea, <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a>, and the reincarnated Straw Man attacked D'Spayre.  Their courage proved to be too much for D'Spayre, and the last Fear Lord faded into nothingness, thus ending the reign of the Great Fear.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Background</h2><p>Led by <a href=\"/annihilus/29-10964/\">Annihilus</a>, the Annihilation Wave spread throughout space. Annihilus believed that our universe was growing while <a href=\"/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">The Negative Zone</a> was shrinking. He saw this encroaching upon Negative Zone space as an invasion of his territory by our universe, and saw conquest and destruction as his only option. Composed of Annihilus' Negative Zone armies, the Wave spread and threatened to destroy everything in its path. Leading the remaining <a href=\"/kree/12-43140/\">Kree</a> armies, several of the universes greatest heroes sought to put an end to Annihilus' path of destruction. Opposing forces included <a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/29-6807/\">Drax The Destroyer</a>, <a href=\"/nova/29-2105/\">Nova</a>, <a href=\"/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a>, <a href=\"/gamora/29-6806/\">Gamora</a>, <a href=\"/phyla/29-40922/\">Phyla</a>, <a href=\"/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a>, and <a href=\"/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>. Also opposing the wave were <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a> as well as current and former <a href=\"/heralds-of-galactus/65-40462/\">Heralds of Galactus</a>: <a href=\"/stardust/29-7491/\">Stardust</a>, <a href=\"/air-walker/29-7126/\">Air-Walker</a>, <a href=\"/terrax/29-2106/\">Terrax</a>, <a href=\"/morg/29-7122/\">Morg</a>, <a href=\"/firelord/29-7108/\">Firelord</a>, and <a href=\"/red-shift/29-40878/\">Red Shift</a>.</p><p>Along the way <a href=\"/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> joined Annihilus cause, but only out of curiosity of how it would affect the outcome. Annihilus began by trying to capture the heralds of Galactus to study the <a href=\"/power-cosmic/12-41039/\">Power Cosmic</a> that they possessed, drawing them as well as their former master into the war. Recently freed from the prison Galactus had put them in long ago, <a href=\"/aegis/29-42607/\">Aegis</a> and <a href=\"/tenebrous/29-42608/\">Tenebrous</a> were able to defeat Galactus and the Silver Surfer. With Galactus and the Surfer incapacitated, Thanos was able to study Galactus' technology and biology to design equipment which would harness the Power Cosmic which Galactus' body collected when he consumed planets. Keeping Galactus weak by starving his body of the cosmic energy required to sustain him, Galactus and the surfer were kept in a state of stasis while helping build up massive stores of Cosmic Energy. Thanos was able to transform Galactus' very body into a living weapon, generating blasts of cosmic energy powerful enough to destroy entire planets.</p><p>It was at this point when a captured <a href=\"/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> had read Annihilus' mind and informed Thanos that Annihilus planned not only for conquest, but the destruction of everything in all Universe so that he may rule over everything that is (which is nothing). Knowing of the impending treachery, Thanos prepared to activate a fail-safe which was keyed into his own power level to release Galactus. Before Thanos was able to release Galactus, Drax ripped out Thanos' heart, killing him. After freeing the Silver Surfer, the Surfer was able to generate enough energy to break Galactus' bonds. Freed from Annihilus, Galactus went on a rampage destroying all of the Annihilation Wave forces in the vacinity.</p><p>With his forces crippled, Annihilus was confronted by Phyla, Quill, and Nova. With the Nova Corps destroyed and the power of the entire Corps at his disposal, Nova was still not as powerful as Annihilus who now possessed Quasar's <a href=\"/quantum-bands/18-42361/\">Quantum Bands</a>. Phyla attempted to prevent Nova's death and grabbed Annihilus' arms, touching the Quantum Bands. Annihilus easily threw Phyla away, but offered an alternate choice the Quantum Bands chose Phyla and left Annihilus for her. Weakened, Nova killed Annihilus by reaching inside his throat and ripping out his insides.</p><p>In the wake of the Annihilation, there is much to rebuild. The once mighty Kree empire is left with its defenses crippled, and the Supreme Intelligence is now dead. The Kree now fall under the leadership of Ronin. Phyla-Vell now possesses the Quantum Bands and has taken over Wendell Vaughn's place as the new Quasar. The Silver Surfer has become Galactus' herald once again along with Stardust, both being needed to quench Galactus' now insatiable hunger. Quill is in charge of helping to rebuild the Kree defense networks. Choosing to forgo rebuilding the Nova Corps until later, Richard Rider still possesses the full power of the Nova Corps and is flying from world to world attempting to answer distress calls from all corners of the universe. Despite Annihilus' death his remaining broken forces are now spread throughout the galaxy. Many generals from the Annihilation Wave are now ruling over their own planets as a result of the treaty struck between Ronan's Kree empire and the remainder of Annihilus' army. Seeking retribution, Terrax flies between planets controlled by Annihilus' officers to put them out of power.</p><h2>Related Story-Arcs</h2><p><a href=\"/annihilation/39-41287/\">Annihilation</a> - The events of the Annihilation precede and set the stage for the Annihilation Conquest story-arch.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/annihilation-conquest-book-one/49-30613/\">Annihilation: Conquest, Book One</a></li><li><a href=\"/annihilation-conquest-book-two/49-30615/\">Annihilation: Conquest, Book Two</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-your-universe-volume-4/37-201641/\">Marvel: Your Universe Vol. 4</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-your-universe-volume-5/37-201643/\">Marvel: Your Universe Vol. 5</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-your-universe-volume-6/37-201644/\">Marvel: Your Universe Vol. 6</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/blockbusters-of-the-marvel-universe/49-38679/\">Blockbusters of the Marvel Universe</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-your-universe-saga/49-22924/\">Marvel: Your Universe Saga</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova-/37-292622/\">Nova #1</a> (Spain)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-crossover-annihilation-conquest-prologo/37-315479/\">Marvel Crossover #48</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-crossover-annihilation-conquest-1-di-5/37-316030/\">Marvel Crossover #49</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-crossover-annihilation-conquest-2-di-5/37-316036/\">Marvel Crossover #50</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-crossover-annihilation-conquest-3-di-5/37-316209/\">Marvel Crossover #51</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-crossover-annihilation-conquest-4-di-5/37-316210/\">Marvel Crossover #52</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-crossover-annihilation-conquest-5-di-5-di-5/37-316211/\">Marvel Crossover #53</a></li></ul>",

Determined to go out with a bang, he uses a venom to \"jokerize\" other inmates, making them insane and bear a physical resemblance to his own white skin, green hair, and wide smile. A riot breaks out in the Slab and Black Canary, Nightwing, and Batman move in to put it down while Dina Bell and Shilo Norman are trapped inside. The Joker prompts Black Mass to suck the prison into a black hole while he and the other villains escape. Blue Beetle narrowly rescues Black Canary, Batman, and Nightwing while Dina and Shilo are not as lucky. Barbara Gordon feels remorseful for being absent on a date with Dick Grayson (Nightwing) while the riot first broke out and begins to wish she could kill the Joker for the pain he's caused in her life.</p> <p>Chaos soon spreads throughout the entire DC Universe and war is declared against the Joker by President Lex Luthor. While JLA searches for him, the Joker hides out on Easter Island and sends his minions to capture Harley Quinn so he can impregnate her and produce an heir. Harley is eventually rescued by Spoiler, Batgirl, and Power Girl. Harley is upset that the Joker had tried to do this without marrying her first.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Joker grows disgruntled at the lack of creativity behind his minions' havoc, realizing that \"every other crisis\" involves red skies and crazy weather. With the assistance of Stormfront and Mr. 104, the Joker poisons the atmosphere and creates \"crazy rain\", spreading his laughing toxin across the world. His next plan is the assassination of President Luthor.</p> <p>While the \"jokerized\" villains are being rounded up, Kirk Langstrom discovers that the venom they are affected with is also deadly and works to produce an antidote with the reluctant help of Harley Quinn. Black Canary also discovers that the Joker's CAT scans were modified and that doctors lied to him about his death with the hope that it would cause him to lead a more sane life.</p> <p>Inside the Slab, Shilo and Dina are struggling to find a way to get themselves and the prison back to earth. They initially try to find Black Mass to reverse the gravity well with the help of Mister Mind, however Dina accidentally shoots Black Mass during a run-in with the Maneaters. They eventually resort to killing Multi-Man over and over until he is able to reanimate Black Mass who then sends them back to earth.</p> <p>Huntress is sent to Arkham Asylum to find Robin, who disappeared into the building and stopped sending out reports. After encountering Killer Croc, she finds what appears to be Robin's remains. Nightwing, enraged over Robin's death, goes to face the Joker one-on-one and beats him to near-death until the Bat family, Robin included, arrives on the scene much to Nightwing's surprise. The Joker is revived and returned to prison where he is put in a windowless, doorless cell (with out an audience to entertain. The jokerized villains are finally returned to their normal selves and all is well, until the next crisis that is.&nbsp;<br /></p><h2>Collected Edition</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/batman-the-jokers-last-laugh/49-32211/\">Batman: The Joker's Last Laugh</a></li></ul>",

        "description":"<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The Skrull are invading Earth. Key figures within the Marvel Universe may have been replaced by Skrull sleeper agents. A possible Skrull invasion is on the horizon, whose seeds were planted during the Kree/Skrull war. The question is...</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> remain in hiding after the conclusion of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>. The current roster consists of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a>, revived by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>, had approached the group wanting to join. Cage was skeptical of his alive-again teammate, but decided to allow him to join. When the team heard that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronin/29-41928/\">Ronin</a> was captured by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hand/65-1800/\">The Hand</a> under the rule of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a>, the New Avengers flew to Japan to rescue her. Maya had been in Japan keeping tabs on Elektra and the hand as well as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-samurai/29-3174/\">Silver Samurai</a>, hoping to try to solve the conflicts between the Hand and the Clan Yashida. Maya was killed, and resurrected by the Hand (as is their normal routine) with the intention of making her an assassin.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"259395\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/259395-49456-elektra_super.gif\" title=\"Skrull Elektra\"><img id=\"259395\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/259395-49456-elektra_medium.gif\" alt=\"Skrull Elektra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Skrull Elektra</div></div></div></div><p>When the Secret Avengers reached Japan they engaged in a fight with Elektra and the Hand. Brainwashed by the Hand, Maya initially fought on the side of the Hand, resulting in Doctor Strange getting stabbed. At the end of the battle Maya turned on the hand, stabbing Elektra through the stomach. As Elektra died her features shifted into that of a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrull/12-43139/\">Skrull</a>.</p><p>The team takes the body back to the United States with them. The flight back is ominous, each of them examining the reasons behind the appearance of this Skrull, and its intention (the intentions of the Skrulls are typically not good). Serious questions begin to be raised. Who among the Earth's population is actually a Skrull? Who among their very ranks could be a Skrull? Is this an isolated incident, or is there something more sinister at work? The skills and magic of the Hand, the powerful magics of Doctor Strange, Spider-Man's Spidey Sense, and even Wolverine's enhanced senses were all unable to detect that this Skrull was not actually Elektra. Spider-Woman suggests that this runs even deeper and that the Skrulls may have orchestrated events which have recently damaged the relationship and credibility within the Earth's Superhero community, specifically the events of the Civil War may have been triggered by the Skrulls. Spider-Woman wonders if <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> could have been replaced by a Skrull, explaining his behavior during the Civil War. She expresses the desire to her teammates to take the Skrull body directly to Iron Man to determine by his reaction if he is a Skrull or not.</p><p>Other members of the team do not like this plan, but they have little time to debate. For unknown reasons, while flying back over the States their plane begins to lose altitude. Knowing that she can fly, Wolverine throws Spider-Woman out of the plane to attempt to balance the load. The plane goes down and crashes. Spider-Woman tries to get to the Skrull body to take it to Stark, but Wolverine cuts her off. She knocks him out with a powerful venom blast, and leaves with the Skrull corpse for Stark Tower.</p><p>Spider-Woman presents the Skrull body to Tony Stark, who wishes to keep it secret for the time. He arranges for another meeting with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illuminati/65-40421/\">Illuminati</a>, a powerful group of superheroes that had clandestinely steered major past events within the Marvel Universe. Not only had the heroes of Earth come into battle on several occasions with the Skrulls, the Illuminati had as well. They had initially formed after the Kree-Skrull War, and had threatened the Skrulls that any more attacks would start a war. The members were even taken prisoner by the Skrulls and studied individually. They were able to escape back to Earth.</p><p>Iron Man brought the Skrull body to the Illuminati meeting. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, Iron Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> were all present. Along with the a fore mentioned techniques and powers that the Skrull were able to evade, Iron Man also noted that its Skrull origin was completely undetectable to his own technology. He also notes to the group that this infiltration may have been a result of what they had done to the Skrull Empire when they had initially formed. Before they could decide what to do Black Bolt reveals to the others that he was a Skrull and launches an attack. The Skrull Black Bolt uses Black Bolt's power against Namor and unleashes a powerful scream. Namor is able to kill the Skrull, but before the team can recover two more arrive. One seemingly has the powers of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> while the other is a copy of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>. Doctor Strange is able to teleport the team to safety, and Iron Man blows up the remaining two Skrulls. Professor Xavier identified during the battle that the Skrull Black Bolt was also able undetected by Professor Xavier's telepathy. The team departs once again, not knowing who they can trust.</p><h3>Invasion</h3><p>Tony Stark has to figure out how to handle this secret invasion. He summons Medusa and Crystal and talks to them with the Black Bolt Skrull corpse in between. Medusa demands an explanation, Tony not knowing much about himself all he tells them is that an invasion is rising and problems will arrive. Medusa then takes the body and leaves to the moon.</p><p>Stark arranges for Mr. Fantastic and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> to study the Skrull-Elektra body at a secret Stark Laboratory. He doesn't know who he can trust, even the Richards or Pym, and he must discover why the Skrulls are completely undetectable to psychics, technology, magic, and enhanced senses, and any other ability. Hank and Reed begin work to uncover the Skrull secrets.</p><p>Meanwhile on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sword/65-41666/\">SWORD</a> satellite headquarters known as The Peak, commanding officer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> and recently arrived Agent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abigail-brand/29-4441/\">Abigail Brand</a> witness an unidentified Skrull transport spacecraft entering Earth's atmosphere and about to crash-land in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>. They contact Stark, who leaves Richards and Pym to work on the Skrull body to determine how they are both completely undetectable and able to copy the powers of Earth's superheroes. Stark flies off to locate the other members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a> to investigate the crash site.</p><p>Susan Richards had been in Vancouver in a conference. There she was surprised by her husband Reed. She later discovered that he was a Skrull and he was there to capture the Invisible Woman using powers like her.</p><p>Medusa arrives to the Inhumans with the Skrull corpse and suggests that the Inhumans take care of this matter. The Inhuman king raises the question of who can be trusted. Crystal then doubts if maybe Iron man was right about a war coming and problems arising.</p><p>While Stark is attempting to arrange for the Mighty Avengers to all meet for the flight, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a> contacts the Secret Avengers to let them know that they can get there before Stark can. Cage calls <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak/29-1474/\">Cloak</a> for a favor, and has him teleport the group to the Avengers tower to take the Avengers <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quinjet/18-41412/\">Quinjet</a>. Only <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> was there at the time, and the team is easily able to take her down. With a mode of transportation, they fly for the Savage Land.</p><p>Once in the Savage Land, the Quinjet is damaged by a dinosaur, and crash lands in the top of a tree. The group exits and notices that the building where they had their first battle as the Avengers was destroyed. Next they come upon the crash-landed Skrull craft. Before they get a chance to open it, Iron Man and the Mighty Avengers arrive. In direct defiance to Stark's wishes, Cage rips the door off of the Skrull craft. A light on the craft turns from red to green, and Skrull sleeper agents around the world are activated.</p><p>On The Peak, Dugan's eyes glow green and he says \"He loves you...\" before he detonates the space station. From the Avengers Tower, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a> uploads a Skrull Virus into Stark's armor causing it to go haywire, and also says \"He loves you...\". Using Stark's Extremis link to the world's satellite system, the virus takes control of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helicarrier/18-40700/\">Helicarrier</a> which begins to go down. Systems in Stark enterprises plants, Stark satellites orbiting the planet, and the maximum security prison for superhumans known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-raft/34-50736/\">The Raft</a> are each compromised. Prisoners within The Raft are able to escape once again. Another maximum security penitentiary known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-cube/34-41062/\">The Cube</a> is also under siege by its inmates. There is an explosion at Thunderbolts Mountain as someone who appears to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a> arrives. At the public headquarters of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, a Skrull version of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> sets off a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">The Negative Zone</a> gateway which sucks half of the tower into the Negative Zone.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"419626\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02_super.jpg\" title=\"Heroes\"><img id=\"419626\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7495/419626-Secret_Invasion_02_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heroes</div></div></div></div><p>Back in the savage land, individuals purporting to be several of Earth's superheroes emerge from the Skrull ship. These heroes were: Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Phoenix, Emma Frost, Beast, Mockingbird, Captain America, Hawkeye, Wolverine, Thor, Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, Ms. Marvel, Invisible Woman and Vision. Wanting to know who the members of the two teams of Avengers are. Back at the Stark Industries secret location, Reed Richards finally discovers the way that the Skrulls were able to make themselves undetectable. He is about to share this information with Hank Pym who takes out a Skrull weapon and fires at Richards, causing him to lose control of his elastic powers and sending his body all over the room. This Pym impostor changes into a Skrull and tells Richards that \"He even loves you\".</p><p>While in the Savage Land the heroes that came out of the ship and the Avengers (and Secret Avengers) face each other. Ares makes note that this is only to distract them but they still face off in an epic battle. While they all fight the Avenger Ms. Marvel took the injured Tony out of the battle field. The Sentry tries to talk to Vision but the Vision transforms into his \"evil self\" and blames him for these events. Ronin then takes Hawkeye's bow and arrow and shoots Beast, Emma Frost and tries to shoot Captain America but fails. Cap was able to shield his attack making Hawkeye doubt if he really is Steve Rogers. Then a T-Rex arrives into the scene and kills two of the Spider-Man and Hawkeye from the Skrull ship. Carol takes Shell Head to the base where the New Avengers first joined forces and Iron Man then said he was going to make another Iron Man suit from the material he had around and sent Danvers to the mainland. Luke Cage and Wolverine see the dead Spidey and conclude that all of the heroes from the ship are Skrulls. The they see Mockingbird crying over the death of the Hawkeye Skrull. She claimed to be the real thing and before Wolverine can hurt her Ronin stops him. He asks her what happened on October 12th. She answers: \"I-I had a miscarriage. We didn't tell anyone. Me and my husband. We figured his birthday would have been October 12th\". This proves to Clint that she is in fact the real deal. They kiss and Ronin tell Wolverine to trust him. Mockingbird mentions that she thinks that Captain America is also the real deal since he's the one who brought them back to earth.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"381810\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><img id=\"381810\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15530/381810-58596-secret-invasion_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Invasion begins\" /><div class=\"item-caption\">The Invasion begins</div></div></div></div><p>Back in Manhattan the Young Avengers watch as the Baxter Building eats itself up.

Noh-Varr then enters the war claiming earth in the name of Mar-Vell.</p><p>Hawkeye is injured in the battle and the Vision takes her to safety while Ronin picks up his old bow and arrow. He takes out three Super-Skrulls and then shoots an arrow through Veranke's neck, exiting through her cheek. Although it seems she's dead, she's not. However Crito-Noll activates the formula he gave the Wasp several days ago and she begins to grow large. Skrull Jarvis then states that it doesn't matter if the Skrulls live or die just as long as 'God's' will is done. Janet begins to emit purple energy and entraps the heroes, villains and Skrulls in the energy.</p><p>Janet Pym is now the massive weapon that no one will survive. Thor pops in and makes her disappear just while dying. The Skrull Queen is still alive and as she is about to be killed by Wolverine, Norman Osborn gets the kill shot. The shot would become \"the shot heard 'round the world' due to all news networks covering the event. Iron Man and Thor go into space and take down a Skrull ship which uncovers all of the replaced people by Skrulls. Including Spider-Woman, Invisible Woman, Yellowjacket and Jarvis which makes Jessica Jones realize her baby is with a Skrull. When she goes back she can't find the baby nor the Skrull. Nick Fury leaves in a hurry when Dugan wanted to say hi.</p><p>The president, after this, takes down SHIELD and makes Norman Osborn leader of the Thunderbolts initiative leaving all of SHIELD's old responsibilities to him. Stark Enterprises are no longer a resource for weapons and Tony and Maria Hill are now unemployed.</p><p>Then <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">Norman Osborn</a> heads to the basement of Avengers Tower where he finds the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">Hood</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Dr. Doom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> and tells them: \"Okay.

        "description":"<p>\"Authoritative Action,\" takes place directly after the \"Unthinkable\" Story Arc in the main Fantastic Four book. After returning his family to their home after the ghastly events they had to endure because of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>. Reed felt guilty and wanted nothing more than to protect his family at all costs. His face now disfigured and his spirit broken he decided to make sure that Doom could hurt no one else if ever returned from Hell. Taking advice for Johnny to let out some aggression on Doom on a past self, he steals a lock of Doom's hair only to return to the regular timeline and begin his work</p><p>At first his work seems to be obsessive but we eventually find out that Reed had been using Doom's hairs a means to tweak his DNA and allow the team access to his castle in Latveria. He convinces the rest of the group to come to Latveria without ever revealing his true purposes. Upon reaching the sovereign nation, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, are immediately harassed by the populace and with good reason. For most of his tenure as the monarch of Latveria, he had been feeding his people lies about his arch-enemies, and now seeing them in the flesh caused anger and resentment.</p><p>The team ignored them and headed to Castle Doom, where Reed did the unthinkable. Taking off his Fantastic Four suit shirt, he placed it on a flagpole and thus claimed Latveria his own. The team was aghast even if they never outright said it. During their time in the castle, the team made sure to deactivate and destroy most of Doom's weaponry's fearing that if another person or country got their hands on it, the results would be disastrous. </p><p>At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D and the government were getting word of this supposed coup that involve the Fantastic Four and sent messages to Reed to leave or it would be seen as treachery. Reed ignored the messages, and hid them from his teammates as they slowly brought to light all of Dooms horrors into the Latveria. The people were horrified and slowly they began to accept the Fantastic Four. They treated them with respect and wanted nothing more than for them to be independent and for the first time in a long time the Latverians could breathe easily.</p><p>However, as a result of Reed constantly ignoring the messages from SHIELD and the UN, both organizations were forced to act upon this seeming treachory. However Nick Fury tried to preempt the actions for as long as he could. Unfortunately, they didn't have enough time and Nick was forced to send his men in to take down the Fantastic Four as traitors. Reed finally came clean with the team and told them of the impending plan to strike them with missiles and he convinced the team to leave.</p><p>In reality, Reed had been constructing a prison for Doom, to make sure he would never escape and hurt his family. In order to do that however, he'd had to sacrifice his family and stay with Doom in the makeshift prison. Reed said it best, Reed would be Warden and Doom would be prisoner. But things didn't go as planned. The rest of the team caught up to Nick Fury who told them the truth and the team hurried back to the castle to try to stop or help Reed. Before the portal could close the image of Sue, Johnny, and Ben are seen and Doom takes his chance to escape. </p><p>He transferred his soul into the Invisible Woman taking over her powers, even remarking on how he always knew Sue was the most powerful of the team, and he carried out a devastating attack using her powers, killing SHIELD agents. Nick Fury had seen it all so he knew it wasn't Sue's doing. When Johnny got close enough to Sue, he switch between the two and took control over Johnny, before finally taking over Ben, determined to use his brute strength to bring down everyone in sight. Ben managed to come back long enough to beg Reed to kill him, with tears in his eyes And with reluctance Reed accepted, mortally wounding his best friend in the process. The next stories would lead into the \"Hereafter Arc.\"</p>",

        "description":"<p>The first arc to follow Waid's \"Imaginauts\" arc was the \"Unthinkable\" arc. This arc would pave the way for the next two crucial arcs, in this triple threat, <a href=\"/authoritative-action/39-47419/\">Authoritative Action</a>\" and the \"Hereafter Arc\" all in the main Fantastic Four comic. </p><p>\"Unthinkable\" deals with the ramifications of Doom's delivery of <a href=\"/valeria-richards/29-2470/\">Valeria Richards. </a>Unknown to the team, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> used the opportunity to cast a spell on the baby to make her into his magical familiar. The <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> had no idea of this until Valeria seemingly spoke her first word, \"Doom\".  In that instance Doom carried out a devastating blow on the team. A trio of demons, whom Doom made a deal with, kidnapped <a href=\"/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin </a>and took him to hell.</p><p>In the struggle, both Reed and Johnny tried in vain to rescue Franklin but the demons were too powerful. They sent a barrage of demon fire towards the Human Torch and thus burnt him in the process. A surprised Johnny exclaiming how he'd never been burnt since he got his powers. At the same time, Sue and Ben were rushing towards Reed's lab to tell him of what just happened to Valeria, then learn what happened to Franklin. Understandably distraught and seeing a connection between Valeria's first word and the sudden attack they deduce that Doom was behind the attacks.</p><p>They travel to Latveria hoping to find Franklin and fix what was wrong with Valeria. As they headed into Latveria Doom had placed several Doombots and copies of himself, to trick the team. The Doombots were easily taken care of. When Sue finally thought she'd gotten Doom, she attacked him with a devastating attack, only to realize too late it wasn't the right Doom. Doom was hiding and finally made himself known. He cast his magic on the team and then teleports baby Valeria into his arms, seemingly winning this encounter with the team.</p><p>He takes them back to his castle where he uses his magic to have the team suffer through painful versions of their team member's powers, and trying to demoralize them in a different way. He gave Johnny, Reed's signature stretching powers and tried stretching him to his limits. At the same time, he gave Sue a painful version of Johnny's flame power. Ben was forced to fight monster after monster. But he left the most \"cruel\" fate for Reed. Both Doom and Reed realized that Reed's understanding of magic has always been flawed. So Doom stuck him in a library filled only with magical literature making Reed feel useless.</p><p>As Reed sits in the room one of the magical books topples over and he notices a message written in flames that says \"Science is everything.\" He opened the book to find the astral projection of <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> who had been imprisoned by Doom. Together, Dr. Strange tried in vain to teach Reed magic. To help understand and let go of his analytical mind while practicing magic. Reed feeling useless, was going to give up until he realized something that would help him develop a bit of innate magical abilities. He swallows his pride and admits not to understand it and he uses that to fuel him. He manages to escape and returns to Castle Doom. He defeats Doom and rescues his teammates. </p><p>The team quickly hurries to find Franklin, seeing him in Hell in the middle of the group of demons who had taken him. Franklin had escaped momentarily before but had been found again. The team battled the demons, and later find that Doom hadn't been completely defeated. Once again, Reed puts an end to Doom, this time the Demon taking possession of Doom for the fact that he didn't come through with his part of the deal (delivering Franklin) and he's thrust into Hell. But before he leaves, he badly scars Reed's face. <br /></p><p>This arc would led into the actions of the next arc, \"<a href=\"/authoritative-action/39-47419/\">Authoritative Action</a>\".</p>",

It deals with the reemergence of the underground superhero team New Warriors in the public eye.

The team, made up of mutants who were depowered on <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a>, are a mystery to the public at large as well as to each other.  This arc unravels the identity of Night Thrasher, who was believed to be killed in the Stamford tragedy as well as the new identities of some notable former mutants, including former X-Men Jubilee (now going by Wondra) and Chamber (now known as Decibel).</p><p>The group also tries to recruit former New X-Man Sofia Mantega (formerly known as Wind Dancer), though their attempts are unsuccessful as the very cautious teen is weary of committing to a new family after being tore from her former life after the events of M-Day.</p><p>When the group encounters the Zodiac, an inadequately trained member falls prey to inexperience.

        "description":"<h2>Chapter One:Coffin</h2><p>The story opens with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elongated-man/29-4437/\">Elongated Man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firehawk/29-3418/\">Firehawk</a> on stakeout while waiting for criminals to show up. Firehawk asks Elongated Man how he met his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sue-dibny/29-1790/\">wife</a>, prompting Elongated Man then tells the tale. Ralph mentions how for each of his upcoming birthdays, Sue would give him a surprise mystery which Ralph would have to solve. While in truth he was always able to solve every mystery, he pretended he couldn't to make his wife happy. Meanwhile, Sue is wrapping Ralph's birthday present; inside is a positive pregnancy test that shows she's positive. All of a sudden, she hears a noise and thinking its <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-arrow/29-5936/\">Ollie</a>. She goes to inspect it. Back at the stakeout, the villain <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bolt/29-5932/\">Bolt</a> appears and a shoot out ensues between him and the sellers. Before Ralph and Firehawk can intervene, Ralph receives an emergency call from Sue and rushes home. Unfortunately, he is too late and finds Sue's burnt corpse in the rain. Ralph's body begins to slump as he holds his wife in his arms as he cries. An hour later, Green Arrow and his son <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/connor-hawke/29-14257/\">Connor Hawke</a> are having a sparring match while being coached by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\">Justice Society</a>-member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildcat/29-7645/\">Wildcat</a>. Connor is able to land a punch on Ollie that was so fast Ollie could barely see it, making him proud of his son. The moment is interrupted by Conner's com link spreading the news of Sue's death. At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tim-drake/29-9290/\">Tim Drake</a> returns from a mission as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a> and is greeted by his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-drake/29-6852/\">father</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"420872\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/420872-sue%20dibny_super.jpg\" title=\"Ralph holds his wife\"><img id=\"420872\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/420872-sue%20dibny_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph holds his wife\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ralph holds his wife</div></div></div></div><p>who tells Tim he was worried.The two then overhear the news that Sue Dibny has been murdered. Four hours later, Green Arrow arrives at the crime scene and discovers that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> has already checked but found nothing. Ollie brings in other heroes to help investigate the area such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-miracle/29-5703/\">Mr.Miracle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/animal-man/29-22707/\">Animal Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ray-palmer/29-34685/\">the Atom</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/metal-men/65-5712/\">Metal Men</a>. 48 hours later, the superheroes gather at Sue Dibny's funeral. Ralph attempts to make a speech, but cannot bring himself to do it and literally cannot hold himself together. The next speaker is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Diana</a> and after she's done all the heroes leave to find somebody on a suspect list. After all the heroes have left, Green Arrow, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zatanna/29-5691/\">Zatanna</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-canary/29-1689/\">Black Canary</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkman/29-8337/\">Hawkman</a> and the Atom meet with Ralph. Ralph turns to them with a face of great anger and says</p><p>\"Help me find Dr.Light!!\".</p><h2>Chapter Two:House of Lies</h2><p>Nine minutes before the present time, Ray Palmer meets with his ex-wife <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-loring/29-22036/\">Jean Loring</a>, Ray gives Jean a crossbow that once belonged to Hawkman in order for her to protect herself after Sue Dibny's recent murder. Following where the heroes left of at the previous chapter, Ralph Dibny, aka Elongated Man, is getting ready with the others to capture <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-light/29-3583/\">Dr. Light</a>, who is suspected for the murder of Sue Dibny. Before they can leave, Hawkman finds out that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a> are secretly listening to their conversation and the two heroes confront the others for their secrecy pertaining to Dr.Light. The heroes are reluctant to say anything until Wally threatens to bring in Batman and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>. With this, Ralph tells Wally and Kyle as the heroes go in pursuit of Dr.Light that once, the villain Dr.Light had teleported into their <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-watchtower/34-41469/\">Watchtower</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-moon/34-42072/\">Moon</a> while the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League</a> was out fighting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hector-hammond/29-10210/\">Hector Hammond</a>. Instead of finding the League, Light found Sue Dibny and blinded her eyes with his powers and proceeded to rape her. The Justice League arrive and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Barry</a> is the first to attack Light, the other heroes attacking soon after. Light is taken down by Elongated Man who hits him with Hawkman's mace after seeing what he did to his wife. Upon hearing this story, Wally is shocked as Dr.Light always seemed a moron when fought during Wally's time as a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/teen-titans/65-19081/\">Teen Titan</a>. Green Arrow then reveals that there is a reason for that. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/merlyn/29-2532/\">Merlyn</a> arrives at a meeting point for the supervillains. All of a sudden, a frightened Dr.Light teleports in and begs to hire somebody. Elsewhere, Green Arrow reveals that the team took a vote to mindwipe Dr.Light, as he threatened that he would go after Sue again. Green Arrow, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a>, and Black Canary had voted against and Zatanna, Hawkman, and Atom voted for it. The vote came down to Barry Allen who voted for it, being a particularly sore subject as less than six months before, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iris-allen-west/29-9977/\">Iris</a> had died. The story is interrupted by Dr.Light who teleports into the building. Ralph is the first to confront him, but is caught in an explosion caused by Dr.Light's hired assassin <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathstroke/29-3588/\">Deathstroke</a>, the Terminator. Elsewhere, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-midnight/29-47757/\">Dr. Midnight</a> is finished with the autopsy of Sue Dibny and concludes that the murderer was not Dr. Light.</p><h2>Chapter Three:Serial Killer</h2><p>The heroes' plan to capture Dr.Light has become more difficult as Light has hired Deathstroke to protect him. Flash is the first to attack Deathstroke, but the assassin activates bombs planted around him forcing Flash to attack him from behind. Deathstroke sees this coming and stabs the speedster, twisting the blade, so Flash is to wounded to get up.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"987491\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/987491-262092_165881_deathstroke_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Protected by the Terminator\"><img id=\"987491\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/987491-262092_165881_deathstroke_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Protected by the Terminator\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Protected by the Terminator</div></div></div></div><p>Deathstroke then attacks Zatanna by hitting her below her ribcage causing her to continuously vomit and prevent her from casting any spells. Hawkman is next to attack Deathstroke, but Deathstroke simply back flips over him, cutting off his wingstraps causing Hawkman to hit the ground hard. Green Arrow takes his shot at Deathstroke, but the assassain deflects the arrows with his sword and cuts the tips of the remaining arrows, making Green Arrow's arsenal useless. Black Canary attempts to use her sonic scream, but Deathstroke performs another flip over her as he wraps a bag over her head so that she cannot open her mouth or breath. Ollie attempts to help her while Deathstroke uses a laser pointer to hit a shrunken Atom. The pointers protons and electrons force him to grow back to normal and collide with a recovering Hawkman. Kyle Rayner is the last one standing, but before he can attack, Deathstroke breaks his fingers and attempts to use the ring for himself, but fails. Ollie, who doesn't want to take the chance, jumps behind Deathstroke and stabs him in his eye socket. Deathstroke loses his temper and punches Ollie, only to be jumped by the rest of the League. Upon seeing this brawl, Dr.Light is hit by a memory that reminds him of the mindwipe. In a fit of rage stemming from what he remembered, Light creates a big flash and gets away along with Deathstroke. After the battle is over, Superman arrives and asks what has happened, to which they tell him the lie that Ralph just wanted the first shot at Light. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/george-harkness/29-29992/\">Captain Boomerang</a> talks to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/calculator/29-2545/\">Calculator</a> in order to find a job. The Calculator tells him that no one is willing to hire him anymore, since he became more and more of a joke. Simultaneously, Tim Drake returns to his home and his father sees the bruise on his face. As he goes to get some ice, he leaves Tim feeling guilty over the worry he puts his father through. Meanwhile, Jean Loring is attacked by an unknown assailant who ties a rope around her neck to hang her.</p><h2>Chapter Four: Who Benefits</h2><p>Jean Loring is being hung from her door. As she screams for help her ex-husband Ray Palmer, aka the Atom, arrives just in time to save her by riding through the phone lines and breaking the rope at microscopic size. As Jean lays unconscious, Ray, who is not a religious man, prays for the first time in a long time for Jean to be safe. Jean wakes up and opens her eyes to him saying \"Just like the old days\". Green Arrow, Mr.Miracle and Superman arrive at the apartment to investigate and Superman finds that the rope was tied in bowline knot. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oracle/29-5368/\">Oracle</a> investigates previous villains with that M.O and finds a villain named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/slipknot/29-4859/\">Slipknot</a> who is currently in prison. Soon after, Wonder Woman and Green Arrow go to see Slipknot who is now part of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kobra/65-55793/\">Kobra</a> Organization. Wonder Woman uses her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lasso-of-truth/18-41435/\">magic lasso</a> on him, only to find out that he doesn't know anything. Green Arrow and Black Canary call Superman who is at his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kent-farm/34-56265/\">parents farm</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/smallville/34-55733/\">Smallville</a>.

Meanwhile, Green Arrow goes to the graveyard to meet Hal Jordan who is now the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spectre/29-2361/\">Spectre</a>. Hal reveals that he knows who's behind this but can't tell Ollie due to the powers he has to answer to. Hal then makes Ollie promise that he'll find who's responsible and make them pay.

Owen later is approached by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-cold/29-2392/\">Captain Cold</a> to offer him the mantle of Captain Boomerang which he accepts. Green Arrow is on patrol when he sees Deathstrokes reflection but when he turns around finds a note telling him that they\u00b4re not finished. Wally arrives to talk to Ollie revealing that during the fight with Light and Deathstroke he saw lights visions that involved the presence of Batman as well when Batman wasn't mentioned before this. Green Arrow reveals that Batman caught their mindwipe of Dr.Light and was outraged by this. Having no choice, the seven voted to mindwipe Batman as well. Wally upon hearing this is outraged and asks if Bruce knows this to which Ollie responds that \"Batman is a detective, he always has a clue\". Meanwhile, Batman tracks down the Calculator as he suspects that the Calculator sent Jack Drake the note. The Calculator reveals to Merlyn over the com that he did not send Captain Boomerang to his death but he doesn't know who did either and that he was played as well. Batman who discovers this then returns to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> to piece it all together. He then solves it and tells the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a> to find Ray Palmer's location. Elsewhere, Dr.Midnight discovers that the cause of Sue Dibnys death was tiny foot prints made in her brain by somebody who could shrink to subatomic size. It dawns on Batman who the only suspect capable of doing this and tries to get a hold of Ray. At that moment, Ray is with his ex-wife Jean Loring who have rekindled their relationship. As Jean smiles at him, Ray turns off the lights.</p><h2>Chapter Seven:The Hero's Life</h2><p>Dr. Midnight leaves the examining room where he tells Wildcat that he thinks Ray Palmer killed Sue Dibny, but Batman disagrees. Ray Palmer is with his wife Jean where the two are reliving their relationship. All of a sudden, Jean asks Ray if they found out who wrote that \"Protect yourself\" note to Jack Drake. Ray tells her that he doesnt know when it occurs to him that the information about the note was never revealed, meaning Jean couldn't have possibly known that there was a note. Ray begins to yell at Jean asking her how she knew about it in which she says she must have heared it on the news. Ray tells her he knows that she\u00b4s lying because Batman removed the note before anyone had even seen it. Ray then figures out what had happened. Jean used one of his old Atom costumes that he put away and used the power it contained to shrink down to subatomic size, explaining why there was no sign of any entry or clues as Jean Entered through the phone line. She then entered through the phone, into Sue's ear and into her brain Jean revealed what really happened. She goes on to explain that she wasn't sure of how to use the suit and increased her size too much causing an infarction, killing Sue. Jean was scared and didn't want to go</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"422591\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/422591-8identitycrisis_super.jpg\" title=\"A mad Jean\"><img id=\"422591\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/422591-8identitycrisis_medium.jpg\" alt=\"A mad Jean\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A mad Jean</div></div></div></div><p>to jail so she burned Sue down with a flamethrower she had shrunk just in case. She explained that she did not intend to kill her but scare everyone into thinking that someone was going after the heroes' loved ones and that Ray would come back to her. Jean later on used the suit to shrink down and hang herself to throw off suspicion which also led Ray to save her, which she was hoping for. Jean later revealed that killing Jack Drake was an accident. She hired a scrub assassin like Boomerang thinking that he would easily fail. She then sent Jack the gun hoping that he would kill Boomerang and the crime would be solved. Jean continues to defend her actions saying it was out of love for Ray and her wanting it to be \"like the old days\". Seeing Jeans face Ray realizes she is crazy and thus brings her to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arkham-asylum/34-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a>. After admitting Jean, Ray shrinks down until he disappears as he cannot deal with the fact that he indirectly played a part in the murder of Sue Dibny and Jack Drake. The next few weeks continue as the heroes attempt to move on. Nobody has heard from Ray, Tim Drake has also disappeared as he is crying in bed over the loss of his father, Firehawk tells her father that she has quit being a superhero and Ollie tells Ralph that it helps if he talks to Sue because \"she can hear every word.\"</p><p>Ollie later meets with Wally, where Wally tells him he is still disturbed about them mindwiping Batman. Despite this, Wally tells Ollie that he would like to have dinner with him and Clark just like they used to do with Barry Allen in which Ollie agrees with a smile. The story then closes with Ralph who is about to go to bed, and talking to his wife as Ollie suggested. Ralph then turns of the lights and says \"Goodnight Sue....I love you too.\"</p><h2>Collected Edition</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis/49-34002/\">Identity Crisis</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-1-special-edition/49-32495/\">Identity Crisis Special Edition</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wizard-the-comics-magazine-/37-155667/\">Wizard: The Comics Magazine #158</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-superman-/37-284210/\">Batman &amp; Superman #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-superman-/37-284211/\">Batman &amp; Superman #2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-superman-/37-284212/\">Batman &amp; Superman #3</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-superman-/37-284213/\">Batman &amp; Superman #4</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286235/\">Crise de Identidade #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286236/\">Crise de Identidade #2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286237/\">Crise de Identidade #3</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286238/\">Crise de Identidade #4</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286239/\">Crise de Identidade #5</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286240/\">Crise de Identidade #6</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crise-de-identidade-/37-286241/\">Crise de Identidade #7</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-/37-289761/\">Identity Crisis #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-/37-289762/\">Identity Crisis #2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-/37-289763/\">Identity Crisis #3</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-/37-289764/\">Identity Crisis #4</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-/37-289765/\">Identity Crisis #5</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/identity-crisis-/37-289766/\">Identity Crisis #6</a></li><li>Identity Crisis #7</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/liga-da-justica-/37-290577/\">Liga da Justi\u00e7a #38</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/liga-da-justica-/37-290578/\">Liga da Justi\u00e7a #39</a></li></ul>",

        "description":"<p>These events unfold in an eight-issue limited series, <a href=\"../49-19262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Death of the New Gods</a> as well as other DC titles. Jim Starlin description of this project is as follows: \"I sort of think of this project as putting an ending to Jack's 'New Gods' saga. Since Kirby's initial run on the characters others have presented them with mixed results. Looking back I'd say at least half of the past New Gods series have done more harm than good. So for me, Death of the New Gods is half honoring Jack Kirby, half mercy killing.\"</p><p>He plans on killing them all, but one will survive and die a good death.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>On Earth, several of the <a href=\"../../new-gods/65-40647/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Gods</a>, including <a href=\"../../black-racer/29-10032/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Racer</a> and <a href=\"../../lightray/29-5317/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightray</a> are found dead with a bloody hole in their chests. Big Barda is soon among the victims, killed quickly in her kitchen while Scott is in the next room. An investigation by the Justice League into her death reveals very little, despite the best efforts of <a href=\"../../batman/29-1699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"../../green-lantern/12-41148/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern</a> (<a href=\"../../hal-jordan/29-11202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hal Jordan</a>) and <a href=\"../../zatanna/29-5691/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zatanna</a>. Mister MIracle darkens the colors of his costume to mourn his wife and travels with <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a> to New Genesis to bury Barda.</p><p>On arrival, they learn that the killer has been striking on New Genesis and that the current Highfather, <a href=\"../../takion/29-2364/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Takion</a>, has been mysteriously cut off from the source. Himon wishes to investigate the Source Wall, while Orion, believing that Darkseid is the culprit, wants to strike at Apokolips. Darkseid's minions, however, have also been victims of the god-killer. Superman warns Orion to wait for all the facts before accusing Darkseid. Orion interprets this as an insult to his honor and fights the Man of Steel. The fight, however, is short lived, as <a href=\"../../metron/29-3616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metron</a> arrives, interrupting their melee. His investigation shows that it could not be Darkseid that was responsible, as he does not have the power to kill in such a fashion. Mister Miracle contemplates using the <a href=\"../../anti-life-equation/12-42524/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Life Equation</a> to resurrect Barda, despite his vow to never use it. Superman overhears him discussing it with Orion, who then asks Superman to keep an eye on Miracle Man after he leaves.</p><p>The three then journey to Apokolips where they immediately battle Darkseid's forces. When they finally confronte him (without Superman, as he is unconscious), Darkseid tries to stop them with his partial knowledge of the Anti-Life Equation. Mister Miracle, however, has full knowledge and stops him. Darkseid then tells them that there is no hope and that he has come to terms with his inevitable death, as they should theirs.</p><p>On their return to New Genesis, they learn that Takion is dead, killed while he and Himon investigated the Source Wall. The next suspects are the <a href=\"../../forever-people/65-25939/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forever People</a>. However, when Superman, Orion and Mister Miracle arrive, they, too, are all dead, killed in the same manner as the others. Mister Miracle then uses the Anti-Life Equation, the first time in front of Superman, to reanimate their corpses to tell of their murder. While they tell of the circumstances of their deaths, they are unable to reveal the killer's identity. Their corpses then disintegrate under Mister Miracle's efforts to force them to reveal a name. Superman and Orion suspected that they had given one clue, that their visitor was the person they least expected. They reason this was the <a href=\"../../infinity-man/29-27485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinity Man</a>, as he only exists in this dimension by trading places with the Forever People. They do not inform Mister Miracle of their suspicions, as he becomes increasingly erratic.</p><p>New Genesis is then attacked by <a href=\"../../kalibak/29-4680/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kalibak</a> and <a href=\"../../mantis/29-13559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mantis</a>. Mister Miracle is almost killed by Kalibak, but Superman and Orion manage to intervene. Mister Miracle is now convinced that Orion is the mysterious killer, and his sudden disappearance, as well as Kalibak's and Mantis's equally sudden deaths, appears to confirm it. Superman and an increasingly unstable Mister Miracle then go to confront Orion on an asteroid where he was seen waiting.</p><p>When they arrive, Mister Miracle allows the Anti-Life Equation to take over and attacks Orion and Superman. Orion, under the compulsion of the Anti-Life Equation, tells Mister Miracle that he was there acting as bait for the real killer. They tell Orion they would leave him to wait, but in reality they simply move to another part of the asteroid field to watch over Orion. Orion confronts the killer head on, but Superman and Mister Miracle are unable to see who it is. After the encounter, all that was left of Orion was his helmet. Mister Miracle and Superman then take Orion's helmet to the <a href=\"../../source-wall/34-42569/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source Wall</a>, where they discovere a second wall with the statues of those killed by the god-killer. Superman wonders why Himon has made no mention of it, when he appears behind them. Superman blasts him with his heat vision, revealing that it was, in fact, the Infinity Man, as he had suspected. Mister Miracle attacks as well, but the Infinity Man is powered by the <a href=\"../../the-source/12-48870/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a>. Superman is imprisoned by the Source and is forced to watch with Metron, who refuses to intervene. Mister Miracle ruptures the Source Wall in an effort to gain more power, but this allows the Source to combine with it's dark opposite, it's goal all along. Mister Miracle is no longer able to use the Anti-Life Equation and, with Metron, becomes the last victims of the Source's god killing.</p><p><b>A list of casualties:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/knockout/29-17771/\">Knockout</a>: Birds of Prey #109</li><li><a href=\"/speed-queen/29-48055/\">Speed Queen</a>: Outsiders -

        "description":"<h2>Background</h2><p>After suffering a psychotic break and destroying the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> created a new reality (referred to as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>) where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant/12-40656/\">Mutant</a> ruled and humans were the downtrodden minority. When this did not work, she reverted reality back, this time eliminating over 90% of the mutant population, turning them into humans.</p><p>Trying to find a way to undo what the Scarlet Witch had done to the mutant population, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> embarked on a quest to discover how to restore the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-gene/12-42328/\">X-Gene</a> to those who lost their powers on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a>. He discovered that all traces of the X-Gene were eliminated from those individuals that lost their powers, including any samples of genetic material of de-powered. Adding to this failure, no mutants have been born since M-Day, making mutant kind an endangered species.</p><h2>Chapter 1</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> locates the birth of a new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant/12-40656/\">Mutant</a> in the small town of Cooperstown, Alaska. This birth marks a milestone because it is the first mutant child born since the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> de-powered over 90% of the worlds mutant population on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a>. The instant loss of millions of mutants made mutant kind an endangered species, the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-gene/12-42328/\">X-Gene</a> being \"erased\" from those who were de-powered (including all stored samples of mutant DNA), as well as no other mutant children having been born since.</p><p>The birth of the mutant occured while Professor X was discussing the mutant crisis with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> and searching out all current mutants with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a>. The psychic feedback resulting from the mutants birth overloaded both Professor X's brain as well as Cerebro, frying the powerful computer. It also caused a power surge within the mansion which caused all lights within the mansion to explode and power to be lost. An event of such importance would surely get the attention of others, and Xavier quickly gathered a small group of experienced X-Men to travel to Alaska in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blackbird/18-41920/\">Blackbird</a>. The team consisted of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>. When they arrived in Cooperstown they found the town burning and virtually all of its inhabitants either dead or wounded.</p><p>While trying to rescue the remaining inhabitants and piece together exactly what had transpired the X-Men found the dead bodies of several <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purifiers/65-14915/\">Purifiers</a> as well as the shattered body of the <a href=\"/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauder</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prism/29-9736/\">Prism</a>. Emma Frost scanned the mind of one of the survivors to discover that the Purafiers had been dispatched to kill all children of the town in order to make sure that they had killed the new mutant. Sinister's Marauders, including former X-Men <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a> stopped the Purafiers and left to locate the new mutant. It was then that the X-Men learned that the new mutant was just born rather than a teenager. This confusion is expected as mutant powers typically manifest around puberty, not from birth. The X-Men departed Alaska to plan their next move, not knowing that the geneticaly-engineered mutant hunting monster <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a> just arrived in Cooperstown. Predator X was created to hunt and feed upon powerful mutants, and it is hungy for the new child.</p><h2>Chapter 2</h2><p>Back at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> Cyclops reminds Professor X who is now leading the X-Men, and puts Xavier to work with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> to try to discover why the mutant's powers manifested at birth rather than as a teenager. Cyclops has already dispatched a small group of X-Men to locate a group of former <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/acolytes/65-9730/\">Acolytes</a> to try to discover the location of the Marauders and retrieve the mutant baby from them, and sent Emma Frost to retrieve <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madrox/29-7910/\">Madrox</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a> for their own missions. Having temporary erased Madrox's resentment towards the X-Men and desire not to work with them, Madrox and the others agreed to come along. Since losing his powers on M-Day, Rictor would scan as a normal human. For this reason Cyclops wants Rictor to infiltrate the Purifiers to determine their motivation. Madrox and Layla Miller are to locate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a> for details on their own mission.</p><h2>Chapter 3</h2><p>Rictor employs the assistance of his team <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> in order to make his way among the Purifier ranks. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a> attacks some members outside of one of their New York hideouts. The innocent human passerby Joaquin Murrieta (Rictor) happens upon the scene as Rahne is escaping, and fires several fake shots into her chest. Rahne escapes in the bed of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siryn/29-3181/\">Siryn</a>'s truck. Expressing a dislike of mutants, Rictor is invited in by one of the Purifiers who is impressed with how he handled himself. Inside Rictor is told to remain still at gunpoint while the guards scan him for mutant signatures. When he shows no signs of mutancy, the Purifiers invite him through a secret door, surprising Rictor with the size of one of their \"smaller\" weapons caches.</p><p>Meanwhile, Madrox and Layla Miller arrive at Forge's home to prepare for their mission. Forge had discovered that the problem mutants were experiencing was not limited to their own timeline, all other divergent timestreams and alternate futures that his machinery could access had shown that mutants have ceased to be. Since the birth of the new mutant two new timelines have emerged, and it was Madrox's job to create dupes to send to those futures for investigation. While Forge is sending the second dupe into the future, Layla rushes into the transport beam, sending both on a one-way trip. The original Madrox tries to fight Forge over what happened, but quickly falls unconscious.</p><p>Finally, having extracted information as to the location of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amelia-voght/29-14868/\">Amelia Voght</a>, the X-Men that were sent after the Acolytes traveled to the hospital that she worked at in Santa Cruz. In order to catch her by surprise, Wolverine stepped in front of a moving ambulance. With his healing factor having fixed most of his injuries by the time he got to the hospital, he catches Voght off guard and she turned into a living mist and tried to escape through a hospital vent. Storm caught her in a breeze, and prevented her from running away. The Acolytes had kept close ties with the Marauders, and of the remaining Acolytes she would know where to find them. Unhappily, Amelia provides them information on where they can find the Marauders.</p><h2>Chapter 4</h2><p>After sending two dupes to the future Jamie Madrox is still unconscious with brain functions working overtime. Forge explains what is happening to Cyclops, and becomes angry that Scott seems fine with sacraficing Madrox to discover what is going on. Cyclops contends that they are all dying out as mutant kind is becoming extinct.</p><p>The X-Men have traveled to Antarctica to locate the Marauders and the mutant baby. Knowing that the X-Men would soon figure out where they are, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> decided to step up their plans and vacate their Antarctic base. They are preparing to leave when the X-Men break into their base.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/surge/29-40509/\">Surge</a> discovers that the Purifiers were part of the attacks. She is angry that they have been left out of the loop and that the young team has been left out of the action. She decides that she is going to lead her team to attack the Purifiers and takes the information to them. Despite Cyclops desire to protect the team, the Purifiers have already killed many students of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>, and they want to take out the Purifiers permanently. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mercury/29-15078/\">Mercury</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anole/29-40458/\">Anole</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prodigy/29-40475/\">Prodigy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-23/29-3560/\">X-23</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/armor/29-4442/\">Armor</a> agree to go along, but most decide to go primarily to help the mutant baby and not for Revenge. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dust/29-4555/\">Dust</a> does not wish to go because she had seen too much bloodshed lately, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a> says that if he goes he would kill all of them, and so he also stays behind.</p><p>In the Washington Purafier base, Rictor is let in on their operations. He discovers that there are hundreds off churches and members located all over the globe. He discovers that the purifiers don't have the mutant baby and believes his mission to be over until he learns who the Purifiers have teamed up with: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-deathstrike/29-8470/\">Lady Deathstrike</a>. After the New X-Men arrive Rictor runs into Anole. They both explain what is going on. The New X-Men do battle with the Purifiers before anyone knows what has happened Deathstrike stabs Hellion through the back and chest.</p><h2>Chapter 5</h2><p>In the future, Layla Miller and Madrox are scoping out a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-containment-center-sheepshead-bay-brooklyn/34-56868/\">mutant internment camp</a>. There are no mutants in public view, and they are trying to figure out what happened to all of them. Meanwhile in the present, the X-Men have ambushed Sinister and the marauders. Emma Frost is located at the mansion, but is with them telepathically, coordinating their actions and keeping Sinister out of their minds. As battle insues the X-Men ask sinister and Gambit where they have the baby. Sinister contends that they are trying to mislead him and Gambit is confused that they don't know where the child is.</p><p>In Washington the New X-Men continue to fight the Reavers and Lady Deathstrike. It is unknown whether Hellion is still alive. As the fight continues to get worse for the young mutants, Pixie utters a spell which teleports all of them away, scattering them between Washington and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>. The telepathic noise generated by Pixie causes Emma Frost to break her focus from the battle. Seizing this opportunity, sinister locks her out of the battle, eliminating any edge that the few X-Men had against the Marauders. The battle becomes more intense, and both Wolverine and Nightcrawler are severely injured. Nightcrawler is barely able to teleport them away from the battle, and only manages to isolate them in the vast ice.</p><p>Back at the mansion the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a> of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinel-squad-one/65-41743/\">Sentinel Squad ONE</a> begin to attack the X-Men who remained behind.

Until now he was presumed dead, and he now carried with him what could be the last hope of mutantkind--the only mutant born since M-Day.</p><h2>Chapter 6</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> make their way over Antarctica, rushing back to the Mansion. Wolverine's healing factor has kicked in, slowly and painfully healing his wounds. Although Storm managed to make it out relatively unscathed, both Nightcrawler and Colossus are severely injured, with Nightcrawler unconscious and bleeding out. They realize now that Cable has the mutant child, and were able to inform the others of the development before losing radio contact with the others.</p><p>Back at the mansion the remaining X-Men and New X-Men are currently battling the out of control sentinels. All of the telepaths in the mansion have been rendered unconscious.

Iceman arrives back at the mansion in one of the X-Men's jets with the wounded New X-Men, allowing X-23 to join the fight. Dust breaks into one of the sentinels, discovering that what is inside is no longer human. The Sentinel robots as well as their human drivers have been co-opted by some of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a>'s remaining nano-sentinel bots, which have been re-programmed to exterminate all mutants. X-23 manages to take out one of the robots, and both of the sentinels are decommissioned, however one of the former pilots manages to escape.</p><p>In the wake of the attack many are injured, and the mansion's lead healer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a> was taken out by falling debris during the battle. All signs point to Cable causing the destruction of the mansion, and no-one can even guess what his motivation for kidnapping the child is. Cyclops realizes that at this point drastic measures must be taken in order to prevent their destruction. He confides in Wolverine that they need a team that will be able to get things done in ways that the X-Men do not operate. He instructs Wolverine to assemble a team which he is to lead consisting of</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hepzibah/29-13868/\">Hepzibah</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warpath/29-2158/\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-23/29-3560/\">X-23</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>. Not only are all of them willing to do what needs to be done to locate and bring in Cable, but all are expert trackers (particularly Caliban whose mutant power allows him to locate other mutants).

As the car crashes, Predator X emerges, and all we see is Peepers screaming.</p><p>In the future, Jamie and Layla manage to lure guards out of the Mutant Camp, by making Layla lie on the floor. When they first get a reading from her, it says she isn\u2019t a mutant, but suddenly it flashes, saying she is one. She opens her eyes, telling them it flickers on and off like that, and multiple Jamie\u2019s appear and beat the guards up. Jamie tries to get information from the guards, but they refuse to talk.</p><p>Back in Alaska, X-Force sneak into the hospital where the baby was, but unlike the rest, Warpath just knocks the guard out and walks in.

As the other members of X-Force continue to follow Cable, a Purifier goes to shoot Warpath, but Caliban jumps in the way, getting killed in the process. Warpath throws one of his knives at the gunman, piercing him through the head. As Warpath grieves over Caliban, Wolverine shouts at him to stay on target, but he doesn\u2019t listen. X-23 takes down Deathstrike, and leaves her, possibly for dead. As Wolverine catches up with Cable, he jumps out of the way, realizing he was heading for the Blackbird, which he flies out over Wolverine.</p><h2>Chapter 9</h2><p>Jamie and Layla, are shaved and cleaned as they\u2019re taken into the Camp.</p><p>As the X-Men approach X-Force\u2019s location, Emma tells the X-Men and X-Factor that Cable\u2019s gone, asking do they want the bad news now.

Rogue slaps Mystique, and tells her that this has to be the last time.</p><p>Back to the battle, Hepzibah throws several explosives at Predator X, and it spits some sort of acid at her in return, wounding her. Malice continuously punches Pixie, and as she taunts her, Pixie turns around and stabs her with her Soul Dagger. While Emma and Exodus continue to battle mentally, it\u2019s revealed to be a distraction, and Dust was able to take him down by entering his body through his mouth and nose. In another part of the battle, Xavier manages to convince Cable to give Cyclops the baby.</p><p>Back underneath the battle, Rogue grabs Mystique\u2019s face.</p><p>Heqzibah is hurt even more when she is hit by Predator X\u2019s tail.

Rogue walks off, telling Gambit not to follow her.</p><p>Back above, Cyclops gives the baby back to Cable. As he does, Bishop stands up and shoots at Cable, only to hit Xavier in the head.

In X-men Legacy it is revealed that his body was taken and revived by the Acolytes.</p><p>Cyclops takes command as the leader of the X-Men. The Xavier Institute was destroyed during the events of Messiah Complex. He says the X-Men are no more, but it is most likely he meant this as some kind of symbolism due to the fact that they will no longer be lead by Xavier. Cyclops continues to run operations for all teams.</p><p>Cyclops reforms the X-Force black-ops team to deal with the largest threats to mutantkind by any means necessary. The team is lead by Wolverine and consists of him, Warpath, X-23, and Wolfsbane.

This is in service of a larger plot for mass destruction of the human race, as he renders all forms of communication useless. The JLA survives the assault and rallies to thwart his plans, but are shaken by the breach of trust by Batman.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><p><a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Bruce Wayne</a> goes to visit his parents grave and finds it missing. He then goes out to find their bodies. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra's Al Ghul</a> is at his lair, he is angry that one of his men had fed an endangered creature with chocolate and killed it. He reveals he has a giant zoo of animals that were thought to be extinct. He begins to talk about a plan that will destroy the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">JLA</a>. <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">J'onn J'onzz</a> is flying over a forest when <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/29-4917/\">Talia Al Ghul</a> and a group of men shoots at him. Struck by the missile, J'onn is perplexed that it had no explosive payload, but is quickly alarmed when he sees microscopic vision that there is a cloud of tiny nanobots swarming. Suddenly, he finds himself engulfed in flame, his greatest vulnerability.</p><p>A while later, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"/wally-west/29-23879/\">Flash</a> respond to a ferocious forest fire. They race each other to the site and a figure on fire seemingly attacks them. After using a whirlwind to deprive the fire of oxygen, they realize that it was J'onn. Meanwhile, at the UN building the Atlanteans and humans argue for peace when <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a> and <a href=\"/plastic-man/29-6270/\">Plastic Man</a> disrupt the meeting because they had received a tip about a terrorist attack. They find the terrorists and they fire a gas grenade at Aquaman while the other fires a flash freeze beam at Plastic man and he is completely frozen. One of the terrorists cracks Plastic Man's frozen figure with a hammer and smashed him to pieces. Aquaman is rendered terrified of water and denies water he needs to survive.</p><p>J'onn is taken to the <a href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/34-41469/\">Watchtower</a> where he is placed in a tube filled with water to keep him from catching fire in contact with air. Plastic Man meanwhile is being defrosted and <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> calls Batman, who is hijacking a helicopter. Superman warns that the Justice League is being attacked but Batman says he's busy. Wonder Woman and Flash decide to go over to <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a>'s (Green Lantern) apartment because he hasn't responded yet. Superman goes over to the <a href=\"/daily-planet/34-55695/\">Daily Planet</a>. Ra's, meanwhile, activates his Tower of Babel and all written words become unreadable. No one is able to read anything. Superman was first to notice this and he tries to control whatever is happening. Wonder Woman and Flash are unaware of this as they go Kyle's apartment in civilian clothes. They arrive only to find that Kyle was now blind.</p><p>Aquaman is trying to figure out how they found J'onn and him and attacked them. Although he is barely conscious, he has that 'Eureka' moment and figures out that the attackers were using the Leagues own tracking devices. He tries to warn them but before they could the bad guys attack them. Aquaman contacts his base in <a href=\"/atlantis/34-41030/\">Atlantis</a> and asks them to bring something for him. Wonder Woman and Flash change into their costumes and fight the mysterious attackers. Wonder Woman is hit by a ray gun and she thinks that she sees someone as powerful as her attack her. Flash is hit by a velocity bullet and he is vibrating non stop.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"271691\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12524/271691-57182-jla-tower-of-babel_super.jpg\" title=\"JLA incapacitated\"><img id=\"271691\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12524/271691-57182-jla-tower-of-babel_medium.jpg\" alt=\"JLA incapacitated\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">JLA incapacitated</div></div></div></div><p>Meanwhile, Batman invades Ra's lair he arrives and finds that his parent's bodies are hung over a <a href=\"/lazarus-pit/18-40817/\">Lazarus Pit</a>. Ra's offers Batman a chance to resurrect his parents. Batman refuses and Ra's says he knew that it was the decision he would make. He then takes out a <a href=\"/red-kryptonite/18-56333/\">red kryptonite</a> sample and Batman looks on horrified. Talia meanwhile arrives at Kyle's apartment, Kyle goes berserk and Talia helps in stopping him. Talia alludes to a mysterious designer of the traps, J'onn bursts into the room and is wearing an Atlantean suit filled with water. He tries to get things under control but Talia knew his powers were limited because of the suit, she hurls <a href=\"/wonder-womans-tiara/18-51489/\">Wonder Woman's Tiara</a> and cuts off a part of the suit. J'onn begins to catch fire again but Superman arrives after putting a force field over Metropolis. Talia still looks confident and she takes out a piece of red kryptonite, Superman begins to feel weak but suddenly his skin becomes transparent and absorbing sunlight suddenly becomes painful to him.</p><p>Batman, meanwhile is still at the Himalayas in Ra's base trying to get away. He manages to get out of the base as Ra's men chase him across the mountain. Batman shouts through the communicator that he was the one who designed the League's traps, the signals trackers and they were all his.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"271690\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12524/271690-121775-jla-tower-of-babel_super.jpg\" title='\"I did this to you!\"'><img id=\"271690\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12524/271690-121775-jla-tower-of-babel_medium.jpg\" alt='\"I did this to you!\"' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\"I did this to you!\"</div></div></div></div><p>He says that Ra's has stolen his equipment to incapacitate them. Ra's meanwhile is calmly sitting in a room, as the scientists prepares to do something. Batman still running says there are ways to counter the traps but before he could tell them Ra's presses a button and Aquaman couldn't understand what he was saying.</p><p>Batman is cornered at a mountain peak, he jumps off the mountain and the henchmen assumes he is dead. Aquaman tries to teleport Superman and the others but he falls unconscious and an awakened Plastic Man teleports them back to the Watchtower. Talia returns to her father's base and she begins to question her father's motives. Ra's Al Ghul tries to reassure her, then one of the men arrive and says that Batman has perished in the mountain side. Talia slaps the man in anger and walks away. The man walks away and into the shadows and he is revealed to be Batman in disguise. Aquaman wakes up in a desert and finds himself very comfortable there, but he is actually in a water tank and the desert is only an illusion J'onn is projecting into his mind. J'onn uses his x-ray vision to guide Plastic Man's finger as he tries to remove the nanobot in Wonder Woman's brain,while Superman is trying to burn off his excess power. He had become so powerful that he can hear a grasshopper's heart beating in Brazil. J'onn figures out that Kyle's blindness is actually a post hypnotic suggestion and when he takes off his <a href=\"/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">Power Ring</a> he begins to see again. They were also able to get vibration bullet off Flash. Even on the moon Superman can hear the world panicking as fires and riots burn down cities. No one on earth can read or understand what anyone is saying.</p><p>Batman calls the League for help on a secure line shielded from Ra's Tower of Babel. He asks them to follow his signal to a certain place. Superman thinks its a trap and he goes there alone, he meets with Batman who says that he will explain things later, but they are going to need J'onn's telepathic powers to communicate through their minds.</p><p>The JLA along with Batman arrive at a snowy summit. J'onn and Aquaman are at the Watchtower. Batman says through the telepathic link J'onn provided for the Leaguers that he has found Ra's tower of Babel. Two fighter jets arrive and Wonder Woman and Green Lantern goes after them. Kyle wants this to finish this up fast since they'll find out why Batman exploited them. The JLA members manage to hold off the defenses as Superman and Flash infiltrate the Tower. A red alarm sounds and they couldn't understand their own thoughts. Superman relays his last thought to Flash telling him to get out. Superman burns off the excess energy in him by blowing up the tower with his heat vision. Superman begins to walk out of the rubble and he begins to fall unconscious. Batman says that it's only residual side effects of the red kryptonite and that Superman will recover.</p><p>Talia contacts them through a separate tower where she is transmitting her words to the JLA's minds. She says that the disruption of language was merely a distraction. With the world's defenses now weakened Ra's Al Ghul is going to set two attacks one in Turkey and the other somewhere else. They are going to launch a canister over Turkey where it will release a nuclear material where it's going to kill half the city's population. Talia says she's telling them this because she is tired of her father's constant plans of ruling the world and only to fail. Before she could go any further someone shoots her in the leg. The attacker says that she said too much and the JLA cannot stop. He then cuts off the transmission.</p><p>J'onn takes off his protective water suit, since Martian's can shed their skin, the nano bots are off of him. He then goes into the same tank as Aquaman in attempt to help him lose his fear of water. He makes him aware he is in a water tank and tells him not to be afraid and to change his fear into something else, with no choice, he tells him to turn his fear into anger towards Batman. At the snowy region, Batman says that they should split up and he and Superman will go towards Ra's headquarters while the rest goes after the canisters. Plastic Man is reluctant to trust Batman but he says that they will talk about that later. Flash super speeds towards the location of the first canister, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Plastic Man are behind. As they fly off towards Ra's headquarters, Superman asks Batman why he did it.</p><p>Wonder Woman, Green Lantern and Plastic man arrive to find that one of the terrorists have opened the canister near a city and Flash was standing near the man. He was vibrating in his place because if he moved he might spread the nuclear material. Green Lantern puts a protective force field over them and gas mask over to nearby people. Plastic man and Wonder Woman goes after the second one. Ubu brings in the attacker who shot Talia. Talia was missing but the man claims he shot her in the leg. He believed that Ra's would be proud of him. Ubu asks his master's permission to drop the man to be eaten by a rare species of lions. Ra's grants him permission to do so.</p><p>Batman and Superman arrive at the mountain side, Batman recalls to Superman the time when an alien named <a href=\"/agamemno/29-55832/\">Agamemno</a> gave some criminals access to JLA's bodies. Batman says that the traps were meant to be fail-safe for such an attack. They arrive just when the man was dropped to be eaten by the lions. Superman saves the man and Batman tries to go after Ra's, only one problem Batman has to go through two lions and a tiger. The remaining canister is in the hands of two terrorists, one of them tries create a distraction by shooting to the crowd. The other goes to the roof to open the canister and release the nuclear material into the air. The first terrorist shoot to the crowd and Wonder Woman stops the bullets from hitting the targets. Plastic Man captures him and Wonder Woman flies to the rooftop. The man tries to get away but Wonder Woman lassos him before he falls off the building. Unfortunately, he bumps into two kids and they fall off the building.</p><p>Superman uses the metal around him to trap the tiger and lions that were about to attack him and Batman. They go after Ra's and Batman tells Superman that Ra's still has a weaker form of the red kryptonite and that he should after the Wayne's coffin. Superman goes after the coffins but finds the red kryptonite on the coffins. Batman goes through Ra's men and he presses a button and the coffins begin to fall. Aquaman catches the weakened Superman with the grapnel hook of his arm, J'onn flies over and catches the Wayne's coffins before they fall to the Lazarus pit. Batman goes after Ra's but he has already escaped and promised that Talia will pay for her betrayal. Batman however was able to capture Dr. Kant the biologist who had designed the Tower of Babel. Plastic Man caught the kids before they had hit the ground, Wonder Woman negotiates with the terrorist. With the help of the Lasso of Truth she convinces the terrorist to give up.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"271692\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel_super.jpg\" title=\"Wonder Woman's vote\"><img id=\"271692\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12524/271692-127714-jla-tower-of-babel_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wonder Woman's vote\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wonder Woman's vote</div></div></div></div><p>The League returns to the Watchtower. Batman is waiting in another room while the other members vote for whether Batman should be excluded or whether he should stay. Everyone votes and 3 for membership and 3 for expulsion which leaves Superman to take the last vote. Each member had their own reasons for excluding or forgiving Batman.</p><p><b>Voted For Expulsion</b></p><ul><li>Wonder Woman: She understands Batman's reason's for exploiting her weaknesses but she believes that he would be a weakness in the future.</li><li>Aquaman: He thinks that they had earned the world's trust but his decision was affected due to his anger towards Batman.</li><li>Plastic Man: He was still traumatized by the fact that he was frozen and smashed to pieces. Batman himself stated that he was afraid of how Plastic Man's mind might react when he was designing the countermeasures.</li><li>Superman: At first no one knew how Superman voted but in JLA #50 it is said he voted for expulsion.</li></ul><p><b>Voted For Membership</b></p><ul><li>J'onn J'onzz: He himself had kept information and dossiers of the League and has since been forgiven by the League. J'onn saw expulsion unnecessary because he somewhat understands why he did it.</li><li>Green Lantern: Kyle may still be new to the League. But he remembers the events of <a href=\"/coast-city/34-47879/\">Coast City</a> and <a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a>. He thinks that Coast City might still exist if Batman's traps existed then.</li><li>Flash: Wally was only a kid during the Argammemo case and it was <a href=\"/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Barry Allen</a>'s days as the Flash. He remembers how people including himself were afraid and knows that those measures might have helped then.</li></ul><p>After the vote is discussed, they head to the room where Batman was waiting but find him already gone.</p><h3>JLA Secret Files</h3><p>In <a href=\"/jla-secret-files-and-origins/49-6166/\">JLA Secret Files</a>, it is reveled that it was Talia who infiltrated the Watchtower. Even then she is beginning to doubt her father. Her father's organization had learned about the plans through tiny hints during Batman and Oracle's communication. Talia got into the Watchtower through the League's food and supply teleporter. She fools the Tower's security system as they think she is Wonder Woman because of her height and her bracelets.

        "description":"<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>It is June in Gotham City, and Johnny Viti, nephew of Carmine \"The Roman\" Falcone, is getting married on the hottest day of the year. The Roman rules over an intricate crime family which in turn rules over Gotham. However, the Falcone mob is in desperate need of a means to launder their ill-gotten gains, and the Roman sees the Gotham City Bank as a likely source. To that end, the Roman has used his influence on several members of the bank's board of directors, including bank president Richard Daniel, to persuade them to accept his family's business. Carmine takes advantage of the occasion of his nephew's wedding to similarly convince Bruce Wayne, but Bruce is not swayed and leaves in a huff. The Roman confides in his bodyguard Milos that he is disappointed at Wayne's refusal, but that the deal still has enough votes to get through.</p><p>Bruce listens in on the conversation from the hallway until he is discovered by Alberto Falcone, the \"good son\" who shows Bruce the door and eyes him menacingly as he goes. Bruce is eager to leave and pursue his regular night activities, until he meets up with Selina Kyle. Selina seductively convinces Bruce to stay, and their dancing attracts the attention of Carla Viti, mother of the groom and sister to the Roman. Carla is in turn being watched over by the Roman, spying from his office and ruminating on his less-than-smooth relationship with his sister. When Alberto informs Carmine about Bruce listening at the door, Carmine tells him to stay out of the family business. Meanwhile Harvey Dent, district attorney of Gotham City, has been in the basement parking garage of the Roman's home, copying down the license plate numbers of various cars. But his actions have not gone unnoticed, and the Roman's goons come and give him a beating, warning him to lay off for his own sake. Luckily Bruce and Selina soon arrive, on their way home for the evening, and help him to his feet. Harvey brushes himself off and curtly walks away. Although Selina asks Bruce if he has further plans for the evening, Bruce claims he is tired and they part company.</p><p>Harvey meets up with Captain Jim Gordon of the Gotham City Police later that night and the two discuss possible means of bringing the Roman down, including involving the Batman. Similarly, Bruce and Selina meet again in the Roman's penthouse, this time in their costumed guises of Batman and Catwoman. Their presence quickly attracts the presence of the Roman's guards, but they manage to escape under a cloud of smoke and a barrage of bullets. The Roman, furious over this invasion of his privacy and at being taunted by his chief rival Sal Maroni over the break-in, puts a million dollar bounty on both of their heads. Batman chases Catwoman through the city but she eludes him even as she dodges his questions regarding her motivations against the Roman. Batman loses her and gives up the chase to answer a Bat-signal sent out by Harvey and Jim, who discuss the mutual strains put on their marriages by long hours at work while they await Batman's arrival. When Batman appears, the three discuss the lengths they will go to bring the Roman down. The three enter a pact (Batman however agreeing rather reluctantly) to bend the rules if necessary but never break them. Batman then disappears into darkness, but he leaves behind for Harvey and Jim the Roman's ledger, an incriminating piece of evidence Batman stole from the safe in the Roman's penthouse.</p><p>Soon, Bruce is in a meeting of the board of Gotham City Bank, very vocally protesting the position of the other board members in favor of accepting the Falcones' money. When he proves unable to sway them, Bruce storms out, but that evening Batman pays a visit to Richard Daniel, the bank president, warning him to keep the Falcone money out. Daniel subsequently resigns from his position and Bruce steps in. In August Falcone meets with his family and, enraged over Daniel's betrayal, orders his nephew Johnny to come home from his honeymoon as soon as possible to take care of the problem. In September Johnny Viti kills Richard Daniel, gunning him down as he is on his way home from a movie. Jim and Harvey both receive the news at home later that night.</p><p>On the day of Halloween, Johnny Viti is shot twice in the head by an unknown assailant while taking a bath. The perpetrator leaves behind the murder weapon, a .22 caliber pistol with the nipple of a baby bottle used as a crude silencer, as well as a jack-o-lantern. That night Harvey, Batman, and Jim discuss the murder, and Harvey lets it be known that he couldn't care less about the death of a mafia hitman. The three discuss the particulars of the murder and toss about possible suspects, when Batman notices that their conversation is being eavesdropped upon. Catwoman, listening in on their discussion from the rooftop, offers to help Batman hit the Roman where it hurts the most: his money. Catwoman's information leads Batman and Harvey to a warehouse on Gotham Harbor, where they discover that the Roman has stockpiled over twenty million dollars. Harvey contemplates stealing some of it, but Batman puts a curb on such thoughts. Instead they together set fire to the warehouse and destroy the money. Harvey cheerfully returns home to help his wife Gilda give out candy to trick-or-treaters. But as he is rummaging through his mail, a bomb hidden inside a package goes off and blows the Dent house sky high, with Harvey and Gilda barely surviving. For months afterward, the killings continue.On New Year's Eve, the scheming Joker intends to release his gas on Gotham Square at midnight, killing the crowd and hopefully Holiday. To that end the Joker has hijacked a plane and killed the flight crew. Batman arrives just as the Joker is taking off and hitches onto the plane. As Batman fights with the Joker in mid-air, Harvey Dent is working late on the Holiday case. Just as he is leaving, his new assistant Vernon comes in with new information on the Roman case. He has searched old police files and discovered a connection between Carmine Falcone and Bruce Wayne On Carmine's yacht in Gotham Harbor, the Roman is talking with Maroni during the New Year's party Carmine is hosting. Sal says that the Holiday killings have been bad for business and that they should put aside their differences to put an end to it. But Carmine subtly suggests that Maroni might be behind Holiday, using as evidence the fact that the hits have all been on members of the Falcone family. Then while Carmine is talking with Carla, she points out his tendency to surround himself with enemies. Carmine's response implies that she too could be counted among that number. Carla stomps off to go out on deck, just in time to see Alberto fall overboard, shot by Holiday.</p><p>Harvey arrives home, apologizing to Gilda for his lateness. She notes his hair is wet despite the fact that he was wearing a hat. Harvey enters the living room to find the Gordons there to celebrate New Year's with them, but Harvey heads off for the kitchen. Jim follows, leaving Gilda and Barbara to discuss the possibility of the Dents having children. Gilda however feels like it's a lost cause, since Harvey is always working. Barbara tells Gilda that business is a taboo subject that evening, but in the kitchen Harvey and Jim are discussing Harvey's recent discovery about Bruce Wayne.</p><p>And high above the city, just as the clock strikes midnight, Batman pummels the Joker and aims the plane toward the harbor. At the last possible moment he grabs the Joker and leaps to the nearby clock atop a skyscraper. The plane harmlessly splashes down into the water and Gotham is saved. The murders continue, and soon it is August 2, Falcone's birthday, and the date on which Maroni is going to trial to testify against Carmine Falcone, but before Harvey can leave home and head for court, Gilda stops him. She is disturbed by something she has found in the basement--a .22, just like one of Holiday\u2019s guns. Harvey claims that it\u2019s simply evidence he brought home from work, curtly ignoring Gilda\u2019s surprise as he goes. Batman has other things on his mind than the trial, namely finding the Riddler, who Holiday let live on April Fool\u2019s Day. Batman tracks him down at a small tavern and challenges his connection to Holiday. Riddler explains that the Roman hired him to find out who Holiday was but kicked him out when the solutions he gave were less than satisfactory. This information leads Batman to posit that maybe Riddler was left alive to spread the word that the Roman was looking for Holiday.</p><p>Carmine is similarly being disputed by Carla, who disapproves of the family hiring freaks like Poison Ivy and the Riddler, as they have done of late. Sofia interrupts the argument to lead Carmine away... to a surprise party in his honor. August 2 is the Roman\u2019s birthday, after all. In Sal\u2019s cell before the trial, Jim Gordon pats Maroni down to make sure he\u2019s not carrying any weapons into the courtroom. But Vernon meets Sal at the door of the court to give him stomach medicine for his ulcer. Harvey is optimistic as Sal takes the stand that his testimony will bring organized crime in Gotham to a halt. Once under oath Maroni admits to killing two members of the Gazzo family, a mob operating in Metropolis. When Harvey inquires if the Roman ordered the hit, Sal fakes a coughing fit and reaches for his stomach medicine. It is not medicine but actually acid. Sal hurls it in Harvey\u2019s face and he falls to the floor screaming. Harvey is rushed to the hospital but once there he stabs a doctor and escapes. And Carla Viti, investigating the coroner\u2019s files on the Holiday victims, becomes one herself. As of Labor Day, Harvey Dent has been missing for a month since last issue\u2019s incident in the courtroom. He has been hiding out in Gotham\u2019s sewers where he crosses paths with Solomon Grundy. At first Grundy attacks him, but when Harvey begins reciting the nursery rhyme from which Grundy received his name, he stops and calms down.</p><p>Batman and Jim Gordon are baffled by the turn of events that have befallen Harvey. Jim has come to the conclusion, based on his discovery that Harvey possessed a .22, that Harvey is Holiday. Batman refuses to acknowledge it, but Jim needs proof otherwise before he believes Harvey is innocent. Jim needs to hear it from Harvey himself. Batman first searches at Falcone\u2019s penthouse, asking Carmine if he knows where Harvey is. The Roman is enraged at Batman, accusing him of knowing that Dent was Holiday but standing aside while he killed, because criminals were the only victims. Batman departs and seeks out Catwoman, demanding to know why she is so interested in Falcone. As usual she runs away rather than reply. Batman confronts Gilda next about her husband\u2019s whereabouts, inquiring about the .22 they found. Batman tells her that he found gun metal shavings on Harvey\u2019s workbench, as if he had filed away the serial numbers there, but Gilda can provide no explanation. Batman finally ends up at Arkham Asylum, talking to Julian Day, the Calendar Man. Batman tells Day that they know Harvey is Holiday but not how to find him. Julian suggests that, it being a holiday, there is only one option as to the location of Holiday.</p><p>That night Jim Gordon, at Batman\u2019s request, moves Sal Maroni to a new cell. Batman believes that Maroni is most likely destined to be Holiday\u2019s next victim. Sure enough, Batman\u2019s prediction comes true when Holiday surfaces to shoot Sal twice in the head during the prisoner transfer. Sal\u2019s helmeted guard lunges toward Holiday, who shoots him multiple times in the chest and takes him down. Holiday trains his gun on Jim Gordon, who can only helplessly stare up into the face of the man about to kill him... Alberto Falcone. Sal\u2019s helmeted bodyguard leaps up. It is Batman, who was protected from the .22 bullets by a kevlar vest. Batman pummels Alberto and almost kills him, but Jim stops him. Alberto is placed under arrest and jailed. A few days later Carmine comes to visit his son Alberto in jail and offers his assistance. He tells Alberto that he can get him out if he will plead guilty to Maroni\u2019s murder alone and drop any notion of being \u201cHoliday.\u201d Alberto spurns Carmine, saying he felt slighted when Carmine sent him to Oxford and kept him out of the family business. He says that Gotham now belongs to the freaks, and he is one of them. On Halloween Jim and Barbara Gordon go to visit Gilda to check up on how she is managing alone. She is still left wondering where Harvey is and if he is even still alive. Meanwhile at Arkham there has been a breakout. All of the maniacs have been set free by a solitary figure who, after flipping a coin, decides to leave Calendar Man in his cell. Carmine is furious over Alberto\u2019s unwillingness to accept his help, which has subsequently led to his impending execution for the Holiday murders. As he is ranting in the kitchen to Sofia, the lights cut out suddenly. The two explore the house with their guns drawn, finding guards dead all around. They burst into the Roman\u2019s office to find all of the Arkham escapees there, along with Solomon Grundy, Catwoman, and their mysterious leader, who reveals himself to be Harvey.</p><p>Harvey is about to kill Carmine when Batman drops in, taking down the villains one by one under the cover of a smokescreen. The distraction of Batman fighting the villains has allowed Harvey the opportunity to grab Carmine, however, and he faces down Batman with a gun to Carmine\u2019s head. When Batman appeals to Harvey to let Carmine go, Harvey tells him that his name is now Two-Face. Two-Face then flips his coin which lands scarred side up. Evil wins; Two-Face shoots Carmine twice in the head from point blank range. Sofia screams and rushes forward to attack Two-Face, but Catwoman stops her. The two wrestle and fall through a glass window. Outside Catwoman is able to grab onto a ledge, but Sofia plunges to the ground many stories below. Two-Face knocks Batman out and goes to take revenge upon Vernon for his part in Harvey\u2019s disfigurement, giving Maroni the acid. Batman finds Vernon\u2019s dead body later and, following the Bat-signal to the police department, then discovers Harvey on the roof ready to turn himself in. Harvey says that justice has been done now that he has killed the Roman. As Gordon slaps the cuffs on Harvey, Two-Face drops one final bombshell as they take him away; he tells them that there were TWO Holiday killers. Later Jim and Batman discuss what Harvey might have meant with his final statement, since Alberto has confessed to all the Holiday murders. Batman postulates that, since Harvey killed the Roman on Halloween, he was the second killer. Jim goes home to his wife Barbara and says that he has to keep fighting for the good of Gotham, despite what it has cost. Batman similarly says to himself that he must keep up his work, for the sake of the promise he made to his parents years ago on the night of their deaths.</p><p>And on Christmas Eve Gilda is packing up boxes for her move away from Gotham, but before she leaves, she takes a box down the basement furnace. She describes aloud to herself how she read in Harvey\u2019s case files about the removal of the serial numbers of guns and how baby bottle nipples could be used as silencers. She then removes from the box a .22 pistol and drops it into the flames of the heater, along with a familiar-looking hat and coat. And she claims that she took it upon herself to start the Holiday killings, in an attempt to end the Roman\u2019s hold on Gotham and thus lighten Harvey\u2019s caseload so that they could have a child Her belief is that Harvey took up the killings on New Year\u2019s Eve and that Alberto is lying to the police with his confession. She also says that she knows Harvey will eventually be alright and that they will reconcile, because she believes in him.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/absolute-batman-the-long-halloween/49-37316/\">Absolute Batman: The Long Halloween</a></li><li><a href=\"/batman-the-long-halloween/49-36359/\">Batman: The Long Halloween</a></li></ul>",

        "description":"<a></a><h2>Plot Summary&nbsp;</h2>&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"/sinestro/29-10448/\">Sinestro</a>, former <a href=\"/green-lantern/12-41148/\">Green Lantern</a> and foe of <a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a>, has begun the creation of his own lantern corps following his defeat in <a href=\"/green-lantern-rebirth/39-54588/\">Green Lantern: Rebirth</a>. After much time gathering ring-bearers who will \"inspire fear\" in their sectors, Sinestro and the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Yellow Lanterns</a> attack the Green Lantern Corps, killing many, freeing <a href=\"/superboy-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy Prime</a>, <a href=\"/cyborg-superman/29-12926/\">Cyborg Superman</a>, and capturing <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a>, infecting him with <a href=\"/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a>. With their combined power, along with that of the newly resurrected <a href=\"/anti-monitor/29-12165/\">Anti-Monitor</a>, the Sinestro Corps seeks to destroy the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a> and conquer the universe.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">The Guardians</a>, in an attempt to even the odds in the ongoing struggle between the two corps, authorize the use of lethal force for Green Lanterns. With their full potential now realized, the Green Lantern Corps takes the fight to the Sinestro Corps, but it is revealed that the Sinestro Corps is attacking Earth. As Hal frees Kyle from the clutch of Parallax, <a href=\"/sodam-yat/29-46185/\">Sodam Yat</a> is appointed the new <a href=\"/ion/12-55697/\">Ion</a>. With the combined efforts of the Green Lanterns, Ion, and the heroes of Earth, the Sinestro Corps is defeated and Earth is saved once more. But the <a href=\"/the-war-of-light/12-55769/\">War of Light</a> has begun...<br /><h2>Full Summary</h2><p>Following his defeat in Green Lantern: Rebirth, the events of Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special #1 see the supervillain Sinestro retreat to the planet Qward in the Antimatter Universe. Here he amasses an army, the Sinestro Corps, that he selects based upon their ability to \"inspire great fear\". Each member is armed with a yellow power ring, mirroring the green ones of the Green Lantern Corps. Amongst Sinestro's allies are Parallax and the resurrected Anti-Monitor. The Sinestro Corps then launch an all-out assault against the Green Lantern Corps and the universe itself.</p><p>During the assault on Oa, the Sinestro Corps manages to inflict heavy casualties and free Superman-Prime and the Cyborg Superman from their imprisonment. Kyle Rayner is captured and transported to Qward, where Sinestro manages to separate Rayner from the symbiote Ion allowing Parallax to possess him.In Green Lantern (vol. 4) #21 the heroes Hal Jordan, John Stewart and Guy Gardner attempt to rescue fallen comrade Kyle Rayner, but are themselves entrapped, with Jordan transported to face Sinestro and his allies. A failed bid to rescue Jordan depicted in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #22 sees surviving members of the Green Lantern Corps forced underground and split into two groups. While one group attempts to free Jordan only to find themselves ambushed, the other successfully rescues Ion. They then re-unite with their ambushed comrades and together they escape from Qward back to the positive matter universe. Hal, John and Guy return to Earth to warn the Justice League of the Anti-Monitor\u2019s return.</p><p>As the Sinestro Corps spreads out to ambush Green Lanterns across the universe, Green Lantern (vol. 4) #23 sees the Guardians decide to rewrite their sacred text, the Book of Oa. They remove a section devoted to a prophecy concerning the \u201cBlackest Night\u201d, against the objections of two of their number, Ganthet and Sayd. They then add 10 new laws, the first of which authorizes the use of lethal force against the Sinestro Corps, while Ganthet and Sayd are expelled from Oa. As the Green Lanterns gather on Oa in preparation for a Sinestro Corps assault, the Sinestro Corps teleport themselves and their Central Power Battery instead to a new Warworld, their objective revealed to be Earth. Events in Green Lantern Corps (vol. 2) #16 show Hal informing the Green Lantern Corps of Sinestro's plans.</p><p>Green Lantern (vol. 4) #24 continues the story, with Green Lanterns and Sinestro Corps members battling across Earth. Hal manages to free Kyle from Parallax before the entity is imprisoned in their power batteries by Ganthet and Sayd. After John and Guy arrive, the former Guardians reveal to them the prophecy of the \u201cBlackest Night\u201d, seen in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25. It foretells of five more Corps arising, each based on a different color and emotion. After the five corps are established, a \"War of Light\" will ensue, in which all the corps are destroyed, leading to the \u201cBlackest Night\u201d.</p><p>The Guardians arrive on Earth and appoint Sodam Yat to be the new Ion. After a lengthy struggle in New York, the Sinestro Corps are defeated by the overwhelming numbers against them. One of the Guardians sacrifices himself to send Superman-Prime to an alternate universe, while Hal and Kyle subdue and arrest Sinestro in Coast City. In the aftermath of the battle, seen in Green Lantern (vol. 4) #25, the Guardians decide to bring the second of the new laws into affect. After realizing that the \"Blackest Night\" prophecy will come to pass, Ganthet and Sayd depart after creating a blue power ring with the intention of creating their own Corps, based on the spreading of Hope to the rest of the universe. The Anti-Monitor, having been blown across the vacuum of space at the battle's climax, finds itself on a dark planet. Here it is transformed by an unknown force into a Black Power Battery.&nbsp;</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-the-sinestro-corps-war/49-32780/\">Green Lantern: The Sinestro Corps War</a></li><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-tales-of-the-sinestro-corps/49-38955/\">Green Lantern: Tales of the Sinestro Corps</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions&nbsp;</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-sonderband-/37-289590/\">Green Lantern Sonderband #7</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-sonderband-/37-289591/\">Green Lantern Sonderband #8</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-sonderband-/37-289592/\">Green Lantern Sonderband #9</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-sonderband-/37-289593/\">Green Lantern Sonderband #10</a></li></ul>",

Problems arrose when the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/12-43138/\">Shi'ar</a> discovered that they had not, in fact, destroyed the Phoenix Force (their earlier attacks had only managed to weaken it), and continue in their pursuit.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> went to stop them since they had to contain the Phoenix before it inevitably killed again in the machine Beast had created.

Arriving there Kitty uncovered that Jean was under the ice - but that's when the Phoenix attacked. Quentin Quire was getting closer to his goal but the corpse's hand kept falling which stopped him along the way. The Phoenix then revealed the true nature of her return, she wanted a power supply for herself and the beams in Scott's eyes were what she needed. The X-Men and the Phoenix force went on in an epic battle while Storm and Nightcrawler were trying to stop the Shi'ar agents. Scott came up with the plan of having Kitty kill him by crushing his heart, but the Phoenix kept talking of how much she loved Scott. His heart jumped by hearing this and asked Kitty to kill him. Emma stopped her by stepping into the rogue force's path and that's when Scott's heart truly jumped of joy. Emma reassured the Phoenix that she kept talking about love for Scott because she remembered what Jean wanted, but her emotions were merely an echo of Jean's. Emma then offered herself as a host of the Phoenix force. Kitty, who worried what this power could do to the former \"White Queen\", phased through Emma's body and put her hand around her heart. Scott told her to allow the Phoenix to take over Emma.</p><p>Emma, now struggling to control the power of the Phoenic Force was pushed by Scott inside the egg shaped machine Beast had created. The Phoenix and the beams from Scott's eyes had found their destiny, they were in equilibrium, but Scott and Emma were now stuck in there indefinately. Kid Omega liberated them both and the Phoenix granted Quentin's wish and revived the Stepford sister.However, Sophie refused Kid Omega and fell dead again. Jean Grey then came out of the ice and went against the force and pulled it out of Emma. They both bonded again in good terms allowing her to have control. Using Cerebra the Stepford Cuckoos showed Jean all the people that loved her and the people who miss her. The Shi'ar agents then attacked but Jean protected her fellow X-Men. In the end Jean took Scott into the <a href=\"/white-hot-room/34-50483/\">White Hot Room</a>, revealing herself to be the White Phoenix of the Crown - the most powerful incarnation of the Phoenix where host and force are utterly combined . As a last request she asked Scott to let her see his eyes and then said good bye.</p><p>The Stepford Cuckoos then were seen waking to the Phoenix's force in their minds.</p><p>Note: The events of what happen later with the <a href=\"/stepford-cuckoos/65-4443/\">Stepford Cukoos</a> happen in <a href=\"/phoenix-warsong/39-51110/\">Phoenix: Warsong</a>.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/x-men-phoenix-endsong/49-30233/\">X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong</a></li><li><a href=\"/x-men-phoenix-endsong-hc/49-36138/\">X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong HC</a></li></ul><h2>Creative Team</h2><ul><li><p>Writer(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/greg-pak/26-42041/\">Greg Pak</a></p></li><li><p>Penciller(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/greg-land/26-2064/\">Greg Land</a></p></li><li><p>Inker(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-ryan/26-2065/\">Matt Ryan</a></p></li><li><p>Colorist(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justin-ponsor/26-2066/\">Justin Ponsor</a></p></li><li><p>Letterer(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clem-robins/26-9488/\">Clem Robins</a></p></li><li><p>Editor(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mike-marts/26-41024/\">Mike Marts</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sean-ryan/26-41782/\">Sean Ryan</a>, Stephanie Moore</p></li><li><p>Cover(s) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/greg-land/26-2064/\">Greg Land</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-ryan/26-2065/\">Matt Ryan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justin-ponsor/26-2066/\">Justin Ponsor</a></p></li></ul>",

        "description":"<p><a href=\"/kenshin/29-45133/\">Kenshin</a> began his travels to Kyoto when he was told about the evil <a href=\"/hitokiri/12-51196/\">Hitokiri</a> <a href=\"/shishio/29-51136/\">Shishio</a> had risen up from the grave, supposedly. The man that informed <a href=\"/kenshin/29-45133/\">Kenshin</a> of this matter was none other than his old friend from the meiji that had decided that politics were better for him than violence. Unfortunately he met his poor end on before May 14, the day that <a href=\"/kenshin/29-45133/\">Kenshin</a> was asked to reply to him about the idea of sending him in to stop <a href=\"/shishio/29-51136/\">Shishio</a>. After this, <a href=\"/kenshin/29-45133/\">Kenshin</a> felt obliged to stop the man, even if it meant breaking his vows of never killing again. Meanwhile, Shishio sat atop his throne in Kyoto, if that's what it could be called. He continued to prove his prowess with the ladies, having his prostitute like servants and Juppongatana members fight over him, as Sojiro calmly talked about how he viewed their current situation. It was also at this time that Aoshi was visiting his former friends graves, which he had buried on a mountainside forest, when some of the members of Shishio's army came at him, giving him a message of invitation, teling him that Shishio had offered him a membership slot in the Juppongatana. Aoshi said know, and for several days came back to visit their graves.<div style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center\"><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45360/38747-aoshi-shinomori_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45360/38747-aoshi-shinomori_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><b>Aoshi reveals his new double kodachi style on the monks who desecrated his friends graves</b> </div><br /></p><p> However, they came too. Seeing that they felt like he would just come along with them after they made him angry, one of the taller monks decided he would urinate all over Aoshi's friends graves. They turned in horror to see him standing right there, and Aoshi let them know what they had done with his blades, giving them judgement on the spot. <div style=\"TEXT-ALIGN: center\"><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45360/192866-aoshi-shinomori_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45360/192866-aoshi-shinomori_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><b>The Okashira lays his judgement, silently and swiftly</b> </div><br /></p><p>He would have to find a way around it. After many years, and after Okubo's death, apparently by a group of insane political bandits, (if there is such a thing) Kenshin went on his way. However, he did not know that the assassination was actually brutally stealthily done by <a href=\"/sojiro/29-51182/\">Sojiro</a> Seiita, one of Shishio's <a href=\"/juppongatana/65-51220/\">Juppongatana</a>, or \"Ten Swords\". After traveling for quite some time, Kenshin came across a young ninja girl by the name of <a href=\"/misao/29-51190/\">Misao</a>. She followed him around for a while, as she was headed to <a href=\"/kyoto/34-51209/\">Kyoto</a>, also. Throughout his travels, Kenshin was able to uncover a bit about the young kunoichi. She was one of the main members of the <a href=\"/oniwabanshu/65-51191/\">Oniwabanshu</a>, the keepers of the garden. With more and more information he was able to discover that she was also very in love (or obsessed, depending on your point of view) with <a href=\"/aoshi-shinomori/29-45360/\">Aoshi Shinomori</a>, the Okashira (or Head) of the Oniwabanshu. Kenshin, of course, had a hard time grasping how she could love such a man he had come to know as a demon back in Tokyo. But, after a while he was able to understand where she was coming from. She had known him since she was a child, and back then, he was much less cold hearted. At least, she made him out to be.</p><p>In reality, Kenshin had known for a fact that Aoshi Shinomori was indeed a cold blooded murderer, but maybe he had changed over the years from what had happened back when kenshin knew him. He didn't say anything to Misao about knowing who he was, and made sure that all she knew was that he knew him. Meanwhile, sanosuke attempted to track Kenshin down in Tokyo, but one of his weaknesses was his extreme terrible sense of direction and inability to muster enough courage to ask for directions, and eventually got lost in the woods somewhere south of Kyoto. He would have died here if it weren't for the fact that he was able to meet monk Anji, a giant man who was a master martial artist.</p>",

Darkseid's \"fall\" has sundered reality, creating a singularity at the heart of creation, into which all of space and time are slowly being drawn, setting the stage for the evil god's final victory, to be claimed in his inevitable death.

The Justice League of America liaise with the Green Lantern Corps to investigate the murder, deducing the cause of death to be a bullet of Radion\u2014a substance toxic to New Gods\u2014fired backwards through time from the future. New God Granny Goodness, possessing the body of Green Lantern Kraken, stymies the investigation by framing <a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a> for the murder; when <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> deduces her true identity, she captures him and teleports him to Command D, a government bio-chemical weapons facility beneath the city of Bl\u00fcdhaven that has also fallen under the control of Darkseid's minions. Slowly becoming aware of the threat the evil gods pose, Alan Scott enacts \"Article X\", a super hero draft, that readies Earth's metahuman forces for the coming war.</p><p>With Batman and Jordan removed from play, the New Gods continue to eliminate the greatest threats to Darkseid's plan. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> is infected by the Morticoccous bacteria by a Desaad-possessed Mary Marvel while investigating Bl\u00fcdhaven. <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> departs for the future in order to obtain a cure for Lois when a bomb placed in the Daily Planet by Clayface mortally wounds her. The original Flash, Barry Allen, is resurrected from within the Speed Force by powers unknown, but then races back in time alongside Wally West, attempting to outrun the Black Racer, the Death of the New Gods, and stop the bullet that will kill Orion.</p><p>Turpin's search for the missing children leads him to the Dark Side Club, where he is confronted by Darkseid's human host, Boss Dark Side. The evil god transfers his essence into Turpin's body and brings him to Command D, where the detective is subjected to bio-genetic restructuring to transform his body into a replica of Darkseid's original form. Concurrently, Darkseid's agents release the Anti-Life Equation through all of Earth's communications networks, spreading it across the entire planet. The two Flashes, having failed to prevent Orion's death, emerge from the time stream one month after the equation's release, and discover that the minds of nearly the entire population have fallen under Darkseid's control, with its super-human victims having been transformed into a military force of \"Justifiers\".</p><p>With the help of the Tattooed Man, the Super Young Team and former allies of the New Gods Shilo Norman and Sonny Sumo, the small cells of super heroes who have managed to resist the equation discover a possible salvation: a symbol from the alphabet of the New Gods that will break the equation's control over minds, which was gifted to the cave-boy Anthro by Metron in prehistoric times. Meanwhile, a huge battle erupts between the superheroes and the Justifiers in Bl\u00fcdhaven, during which the equation-controlled Wonder Woman infects the heroes with Morticoccous, which strips the heroes of their powers. However, the loss of these troops is soon mitigated by the turning of Libra's Justifiers, control over whom is usurped by Lex Luthor and Doctor Sivana so they can help defeat Darkseid. These twists and turns are observed by Nix Uotan, whose powers and memories of his true nature are unlocked with the help of Metron and a mysterious ape-like figure in a robe.</p><p>Escaping confinement in Command D, Batman uses the radion bullet to mortally wound Darkseid, before the dark god uses his Omega Beams to apparently kill the Caped Crusader. Superman returns to the present and tears Command D apart to recover Batman's corpse, and faces off against Darkseid as the Flashes come racing into Bl\u00fcdhaven, the Black Racer hot on their heels. As the heroes reach superluminal velocity, time warps around the Flashes, creating the temporal eddy into which Darkseid fires the bullet, sending it back in time to kill Orion. Outpacing Omega Beams fired from the eyes of the humans in Darkseid's thrall, the Flashes lead both the beams and the Black Racer straight to Darkseid, finishing the job Batman had begun and bringing the touch of death to the god of evil. Simultaneously, The Ray traces the Metron symbol across the face of the Earth in beams of light, liberating all those under the equation's control; the freed Wonder Woman uses her lasso of truth to expel Darkseid's essence from Turpin's body.</p><p>Although physically bested, Darkseid's dying essence is still dragging all of reality into nothingness along with it. Time and space break down as the effect worsens, until eventually, only Superman is left in the darkness at the end of creation, struggling to complete a copy of the \"Miracle Machine,\" a wish-granting machine shown to him by Brainiac 5 during his trip to the future. Darkseid's essence re-emerges to claim the machine, but Superman destroys him for good by countering the vibrational frequency of his lifeforce with a counter-vibration. With Darkseid's end, however, the evil behind evils emerges: Mandrakk, the Dark Monitor, fallen father of Nix Uotan, who waits at the end of all things to consume what remains. Superman uses the solar energy in his own cells to power the Miracle Machine, and makes a wish that is granted by the appearance of an army of Supermen from all across the multiverse. Nix Uotan joins the clash, using his Monitor powers to summon the Green Lantern Corps, the Zoo Crew, the Super Young Team, the armies of Heaven itself, and more for a final battle with Mandrakk that culminates in the Corps spearing him with a stake created by the combined energy of their rings. The heroes drag Earth out of the black hole that is Darkseid, and Nix Uotan returns to being human as the other Monitors cease to exist in accordance with the wish Superman had made: a wish for a happy ending.</p><p>In the distant past, Anthro dies of old age in a cave. His body is discovered by Bruce Wayne\u2014not dead, but sent back in time by the Omega Beams\u2014who picks up where Anthro left off, drawing a bat symbol on the cave wall...</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis/49-30641/\">Final Crisis</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis-legion-of-3-worlds/49-37177/\">Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis-revelations/49-27308/\">Final Crisis: Revelations</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis-rogues-revenge/49-37105/\">Final Crisis: Rogues' Revenge</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terror-titans/49-38678/\">Terror Titans</a></li></ul><h2>Related Items</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis-1-directors-cut/49-22627/\">Final Crisis Director's Cut</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis-sketchbook/49-27175/\">Final Crisis Sketchbook</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-legends-final-crisis-part-four-of-seven/37-218686/\">Batman Legends #31</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-legends-final-crisis-part-six-of-seven/37-218688/\">Batman Legends #32</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-premium-final-crisis-legion-der-3-welten/37-287440/\">DC Premium #64</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-1-of-7/37-250097/\">DC Universe Presents #25</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-3-of-7/37-250092/\">DC Universe Presents #26</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-5-of-7/37-250088/\">DC Universe Presents #27</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-universe-presents-final-crisis-part-7-of-7/37-250073/\">DC Universe Presents #28</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-sonderband-/37-289599/\">Green Lantern Sonderband #16</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292902/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292903/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292904/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #3</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292905/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #4</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292906/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #5</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292907/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #6</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292908/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #7</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292909/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #8</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292910/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #9</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/preludio-para-a-crise-final-/37-292911/\">Prel\u00fadio Para A Crise Final #10</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-legends-part-7-of-7-the-incredible-conclusion/37-259466/\">Superman Legends #28</a></li></ul><h2>Novelization</h2><table class=\"t-editor full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2132295\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67397/2132295-final_crisis.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2132295\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67397/2132295-final_crisis_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div></td><td><blockquote><i>Victorious at long last against his enemies on the world of New Genesis, Darkseid has unleashed the forces of Apokolips on Earth.

Cyclops tells them that there are twenty-five students left at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Institute</a>, an eigth of the mutant population. He says that they don't even know the kids, but that ends today.</p>\n<p>Next, down in the Med Lab, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast </a>fixes Dust's dislocated shoulder, while <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie </a>tells them how she's a member of the New X-Men, how she can peform a spell and that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-66486/\">Dr. Strange </a>said that he'd teach her more when she's eighteen. She proceeds to ask why Dust where's the burqa, commenting that she's really pretty. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gentle/29-41124/\">Nezhno </a>interupts correcting Pixie, and Pixie thanks him for saving her down in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a>, but wonders why he had \"a spasm\". Nezhno reveals that when he activates his \"powers\" his strength increases, and soon the vibranium tatoos he has will no longer be able to contain his power, and he'll die. Mercury then pops in and asks the three how old they are.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anole/29-40458/\">Anole's </a>playing snooker, while <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide </a>(lava form) bugs him asking if <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-23/29-3560/\">X-23 </a>can chop his other arm off.

Anole is angered by this, and just then, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mercury/29-15078/\">Mercury </a>appears, with a question...</p>\n<p>Mercury goes to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir's </a>room, to ask him how old he is. But, he tells her how he can feel all cells aging and dying, but the question is can he stop it? She walks away to go ask David how old Elixir is.</p>\n<p>Mercury knocks on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion's </a>door, but suddenly the whole wall is blown back as is she. Turns out he was practicing using his TK, but he says that anything smaller than a fridge, and he can't deal with it. She asks them how old the Cuckoos are, and he replies they're really 2, and he asks why? She replies Matt Landru.</p>\n<p>In Cerebra, the Cuckoos are scanning the world, while Mercury preceeds to tell them and Hellion that the youngest mutant is probably one of them. They decide to exclude <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tito-bohusk/29-48656/\">Tito</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molly-hayes/29-1936/\">Molly Hayes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a> and the Cuckoos from they're investigation. Then, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost </a>opens the door, telling Mercury and Hellion to come to her office for a student-teacher meeting.</p>\n<p>Outside, Beast and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus </a>are waiting for Rockslide to arrive. Suddenly, Rockslide falls out of the sky above them, Anole pushing him down into the ground. Five minutes later, and Beast asks him to fire a limb, so that he'll explode and Beast can study him. He refuses at first, but when Anole calls him sissy,, he fires a limb and explodes. Beast thanks Anole, and both take shelter behind Colossus. Beast tells Rockslide that if he can hear him, try to feel the rocks and pull him together. He does so, and Beast says that he wants to see what'd happen if he reforms if he's smashed by someone else, and Anole fladly volenteers behind him</p>\n<p>Surge goes around asking the students asking what happened to David in Limbo, and they all try to avoid it, but X-23 tells her what happened with excruciating detail.</p>\n<p>She storms off while Pixie, flies behind her, telling her that she thinks that she and David are a cute couple. Cyclops and Wolverine show up, and Cyclops tells Surge that they need to talk, while Wolverine takes Pixie with him.</p>\n<p>In Emma's office, she tries to talk to Mercury and Hellion, but they tell her that they think she's sad.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Shadowcat </a>tries to have a meeting with Elixir, but he tells her that he's thinking, and when she asks what about, he tells her a bunch of mumbo about life and death.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolf-cub/29-40640/\">Wolf Cub </a>and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loa/29-40672/\">Loa </a>ponder whose the youngest mutant while eating, Pixie flies past behind them, Wolverine in pursuit, cursing the unicorns that he's seeing via Pixie's dust.</p>\n<p>Most of the students are gathered in one room, wondering who the youngest mutant is. At first, it is said to be Wolf Cub, but then Mercury realises that Indra's name isn't on the list, and then he's revealed the youngest mutant. Meanwhile, in the same room, David tries to get Surge's attention, but she keeps ignoring him. And then she jumps at Hellion, and kisses him. Everyone looks shocked, and X-23 sheathes her claws, while Rockslide tells Indra that he's dead....</p>\n<p>Back to the Purifiers, and they've planted a burqa of Sooraya's tied between two trees, and Predator X eats it, making Dust it's new target.</p><a></a>\n<h2>Endangered Species</h2>\n<p>At the Guthries, Beast and Dark Beast arrive, and Lucinda tells her kids to go and do they're homework. Beast preceeds to ask for a gene sample from her. Lewis, a son of Lucinda's goes outside, but is followed by Dark Beast. Dark Beast sees him acting as if he has super-powers, but Lewis tells him it's not a game, and tells him that he's waiting for his powers to kick in. Dark Beast tells him it ain't gonna happen, because of M-Day, but Lewis tries to remain optimistic. Dark Beast tells him it ain't gonna happen, unless he wants to try it from a different angle, offering him a small vile of liquid.</p>\n<p>Back inside, Beast explains to Lucinda the situation, but she refuses to do it.</p>\n<p>Back outsice, Dark Beast tells Lewis that he has to use his powers for good, and Lewis says he will, and he'll find his brother's killers and take them to jail. Lewis tells him that he's all for it, and Dark Beast tells him to role up his sleeve.</p>\n<p>Inside, Lucinda tells Beast that she it's like waiting for her kids to be drafted into a war, and she continues to refuse. Beast tries to convince her , but then, one of the Guthrie girls come running in, telling her that Lewis is sick. They all run outside to see Dark Beast holding Lewis, Lewis's skin all pick and lumpy, with a pink fluid coming from his mouth.</p>\n<p>The issue begins with a conversation earlier in the day between Cyclops and Surge. Cyclops congradulates Surge on how well she's done, bt she just tells him that it was pure luck. Surge asks him how he felt when Jean Grey died, and asks him if he could save her, even if it meant her hating him, wouldn't it be worth it?</p>\n<p>Back to the present, Surge is still kissing Hellion. David runs off, and Hellion pushes X-23 away, scowling at her. He turns to -23, who runs away, Mercury shouting after her. Hellion then flies away, while Pixie asks Surge what they should do about Indra, but all she tells them to do is not to let him die. Rockslide calls first shift of babysitting Indra, something Indra wasn't that heppy about.</p>\n<p>Predator X continues on his way to New York.</p>\n<p>David is in his room packing away his things, and he is approched by the Stepford Cuckoos. They tell him that he only forgot what he learned when he had his powers, and they can restore the links. They continue to tell him that they wouldn't have offered if they hadn't thought his mind wasn't strong enough. He stares at a photo of the New X-Men, and he tells them to do it.</p>\n<p>Indra and Rockslide are playing on a video game, and Indra thanks Rockslide for staying with him. Suddenly Rockslide explodes, and Indra armors up. Rockslide laughs at him for being so scarred, and Indra tells him he's going to bed.</p>\n<p>Mercury goes into the Girls Bathroom, looking for X-23. She finds her there, and she's cut everything around her, and herself. She tells Mercury that she doesn't understand, but Mercury just quietens her, telling her everything'll be fine...</p>\n<p>Outside, Hellion is sitting on the head of a damaged Sentinel. Dust arrives to talk with him. They talk for a little, and Hellion asks if Mercury sent her? She tells her yes, and he thanks her.</p>\n<p>In Elixir's room, his skin turns from gold, to black.</p>\n<p>Match is sitting in the middle of the room, with a marshmallow over his head, saying that he hates Rockslide. Zoom out for a panel of the group from the Quest for Magik issues, sitting around Match, Rockslide roasting a marshmallow on his head, all having a campfire. They all have they're little complaints, but Rockslide says that if they're going to go down, they should all go down together. He then ruins the moment when he says that they should start bonding, shouting \"Anole's gay!\", and Anole scowls at him. Beast enters the room, with new bulletproof costumes for all.</p>\n<p>Surge if pouting in her room when David enters in his new costume. He tells her that he's staying, but she shouts random nasty things at him to try and get him to leave. She even goes so far as trying to punch him, but he blocks it, and puts her in a lock, and Hellion sees them through the doorway. Hellion slams him telekinetically into the ceiling, and then checks on Surge. David hits him in the face, back and face, and then tells him that he hit him with three parts of the human body that are essentially unbreakable, and he better go see Elixir about his injuries. David leaves and tells Surge that they're through.</p>\n<p>On the Astral Plane, the Astonishing team share they're thoughts about the students, Shadowcat saying that she's worried about Elixir.</p>\n<p>Back with the group, as everyone sleeps, we see Loa getting up. We see Dust, X-23 and Mercury having some sort of a slumber party, and Surge's room trashed, while David looks out a window.</p>\n<p>Loa goes to Elixir's room, and tells him that she's been thinking, and asks him if he wants to make-out. Elixir's skin suddenly turns gold again, and he says \"Sure?\"</p>\n<p>Cyclops tells the New X-Men that they might be the last generation of X-Men, and that if the X-Men are not there, Prodigy will fill in as a substitute teacher. He asks Surge if this is okay, and she says fine.</p>\n<p>Predator X is approaching the Institute, but turns and head somewhere else. Mathew Risman shouts at the screen, but a Purifier tells him that maybe it's found a new target. Risman realises what this means, and tells the Purifiers that they have much more to do.</p>\n<p>There's a pin-up in the back of the issue to fill in for the missing Endangered Species tie-in. It was a pin-up by Bryan Hitch of Mercury, X-23 and Surge.</p>",

Dematteis and his cohorts created a long series of adventures, fairly skillfully woven together tighter and tighter.</p> <p>The initial setup is that a series of supernatural adventures, guest starring sometimes long unseen Marvel Universe lesser characters, takes the Defenders through their paces, against a backdrop of the team having really bonded. They might not have had the Avengers charter and all the rest of the trappings but by this point the Defenders were a regular team in all but name- they hung out at Doctor Strange's brownstone in Greenwich Village, had a fixed roster, treated each other like a (dysfunctional) family, and so on.</p> <p>Juxtaposed with this were classic Defenders in-fighting, Kraft and Gerber era style darkness and offbeat tales, and a deep sympathy with the late 60s and early 70s contrasting the (as yet unretconned) pasts of some of Marvel's monster magazine period characters with the changes in the general Marvel Universe.</p> <p>Harking back to the Silver Age Marvel style, there were quotes from poems, pop culture references by the score, and some genuinely nasty supernatural elements. </p> <p>The story arc also debuted a character destined to be added to the team and pushed to prominence for a short time- the Gargoyle!</p> <p>All in all leading up to issue 100 it was good to see some sophisticated overlapping of stories for the first time in years. Opinion divides over whether the big reveal is big or credible enough a payoff...</p> <p>The source of the recent supernatural threats is shown to be, not beings like Thog, who are involved, but in fact the entity from whom the lesser evils take their existence- SATAN!</p> <p>Tired of seeing his son, Hellstrom, and his daughter, Hellcat, free and uncorrupted, Satan has contrived the whole involved plot- which included Strange unwisely using a teleportation spell which weakens reality, and many similar touches- to entrap his son and daughter and return them to their true destiny as scions of the netherworlds.</p> <p>The story arc touches on a lot of dark aspects, including incest, sin, damnation, drug addiction, crazed doomsday cults with Jewish and Christian overtones- in a sense, classic Defenders. In another sense, it was the watershed- after this the Defenders either had to be another Marvel cookie cutter team destined for action figures and general audience entertainment or pretty much permanently get sidelined in the new corporatised reality of comics.&nbsp;</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/essential-defenders-volume-five/37-233494/\">Essential Defenders Vol. 5</a></li></ul>",

        "description":"<p>In the fall-out of Identity Crisis Barry Allen's (Flash II) old enemies Captain Cold and Mirror Master recruited Captain Boomerang's Son, Trickster II and, Weather Wizard to reform the Rogues. On the otherside re-formed Rogues Heat-wave, Pied-piper, Magenta and the Original Trickster had started working for the FBI in an attempt to capture the Rogues. They had gone as far as kidnapping the orignal Captain Boomerang and revieving his corpse for questioning. The Rogues attacked an FBI headquarters. While that was going on Zoom attacks Jay Garrick asking for his help. The former Rogues launch an attack on the Rogues home base. This leads to an all out <strong>ROGUE WAR</strong>. Wally quickly runs to Keystone City, only to find it in chaos, tornados, fire and lots of ice. Wally quickly outs the fires until he is caught in the cross fire between Heat-wave and Captain Cold. Wally stops to ask why the re-formed Heat-Wave attacked him and Heat-wave says \"You put out the pretty fire.\" Wally gets confused and is about to be attacked by Captain Cold when The Top shows up. The Top is another former rogue who didn't go good but knows a secret about the reformed villians that he intends to right. ( The Top knows what anyone who read Identity Crisis does that former heros such as Barry Allen with the help of Zatanna forced those and many other villians to re-form). The Top begins battling Wally until the Pied Piper shows up and puts The Top to sleep. Turns out The Top was just playing possum and quickly frees Pied Pipers mind. The Top moves on to the Original Trickster and frees his mind. The Pied-Piper quickly goes on a rampage claiming his heart is dead. Wally takes a risk and shows Piper his real identity and it works. Piper passes out and Wally takes him to his house and tells Linda to watch him. Captain Cold and Heat-Wave continue thier battle until The Top comes back around and frees Heat-Waves mind. This gets Captain Colds attention they banter back and forth then The Top revielies that he has brought his own rogues! The new kids include Grinder, Murmur, Plunder, Double Down and Tarpit. As The Top begins to claim victory Wally gets back hits him with a super fast right hand. The New Kids jump Wally at The Tops command ( All the new rogues are actually under The Tops control he is using his power of suggestion.) Captain Cold then freezes The Top and ends his life by smashing him into a tiny pieces. Wally kicks it up a notch and smashing up Grinders face and dumping him in a river. Wally then assembles a containment cell around Murmur, and beats down Double Down. Mirror Master calls in the reinforcements Dr. Alchemy and, Gorilla Grood. Gorilla Grood attacks Wally until Bart Allen shows up helping Wally get the upper hand. Together they return to take on the Rogues only to find something far worse waiting for them. ZOOM shows up dispatching the rogues easily and quickly grabs Bart by the necking telling Wally \"Just like Barry did to Thawne,\" with that the true threat is revealed... Eobard Thawne, Professor Zoom, The Reverse Flash. ZOOM rebuilt The Time Treadmill and captured Jay Garrick to go and get The Reverse Flash and bring him to the future to teach Wally a lesson. ( ZOOM grabbed him from moments before Barry Allen snaps his neck.) Wally jumps into action freeing Jay Garrick and Bart. Reverse Flash Attacks Wally and puts him on the Treadmill and ZOOM powers it up and takes Wally back to the worse day of his life the day ZOOM caused the miscarriage of his unborn twins. Wally was forced to watch over and over and over, until in a flash ( no pun intended ) Barry Allen shows up looking for Thawne. Barry quickly frees Wally and they go after thier counter parts Barry quickly captures Thawne and takes him back. ZOOM takes off and Wally gives chase ZOOM plans to kill Linda, Wally gives chase and at the last moment pushes ZOOM causing him to block the sonic boom he created that caused Lindas miscarriage. Zoom was then lost in the time stream on the trip back to the present. Upon returning to the present Wally is informed by Pied Piper that Linda is in the hospitial. Wally rushs there just in time to meet his two new kids.

He also said that he was intend to be Enejak with the help of <a href=\"/finitevus/29-45340/\">Finitevus</a>, but the mad docotr pulled a double cross and now everyone is in trouble; all the while Sonic tries to ask Eggman for the help with the new Enerjak.</p><div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/55000/54252/171025-enerjak-reborn_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/55000/54252/171025-enerjak-reborn_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>Knuckles crossing over</strong> </div><br /><p>In issue 181,Sonic and Tails take he Tornado to Angel Island, where NICOLE's spy-bots watch the new Enerjak taking sending the Dingoes Army to the Island's desert, Sandopolis, and destroying <a href=\"/general-kage/29-52527/\">General Kage</a>by tearing apart at the atomic level. But the Blue Blur arrives too late as Enerjak transports the civilian echidnas, which includes Knuckles's mom, step-dad, and baby half-borther; and then takes the Dark Legion's cyborg implants, declaring that his mission is to destroy all of technology. By the time Sonic reaches the power mad echdina, Enerjak teleports himself to the nanite-form city of New Mobotropolis, where he reaveal to the <a href=\"/chaotix/65-45382/\">Chaotix</a> and <a href=\"/freedom-fighters/65-45381/\">Freedom Fighters</a>the echidna behind the mask is none other than Knuckles! In a back-up story in the issue, it goes into detail about how Knuckles became Enerjak. Fintitvevus manage to capture the Guardian with the help of the <a href=\"/destructix/65-45385/\">Destructix</a> and took him to the Shrine of the <a href=\"/master-emerald/18-47754/\">Master Emerald</a>. He tempted Knuckles with idea of using the Master Emerald's power in order to save last 10% of the echidna population since General Kage's take over. But what the guardian didn't know was that Finitevus had put negative-energy in the Emerald, allowing him to mold the new Enerjak's mind into doing one thing: Destroy all technology of Mobius!</p><p><br />In issue 182, Enerjak declares that he'll free the people of <a href=\"/new-mobotropolis/34-55453/\">New Mobotropolis</a> of the evils of technology, but Sally opposes from his rampage on Angel Island, NICOLE defends tech by stating how it gave her a chance at life, and Julie-Su begged Knuckles to stop from his past deeds with the Chaos Powers . Of course, Enerjak was not pleased.</p><p>As Enerjak was about to 'liberate' Julie-Su from her cybernetic implants, Sonic dives in and save her.

As fast and powerful as the hedgehogs are, they are hardly a match for living the god. As Enerjak attacked Sahdow, Sonic knocks off the echdina's helmet and fond out that he was fighting his main man Knuckles! Not willing to fight, the Sally rallies the Freedom Fighters, Choatix and the civilians to charge Knuckles, only to be frozen still. All hope seems lost until <a href=\"/dr-robotnik/29-45329/\">Dr. Robotnik</a> and his Eggfleet appeared and transport Knuckles to Eggman's Egg-Grape vineyard. Shortly after, Sonic and Sally arguing over if they shold escue Knuckles or not when a warp ring appears and someone's arm grabs and pulls both Sonic and Julie-Su through. It turns out to Knuckles's father, <a href=\"/locke/29-45319/\">Locke</a>. He proses a plan to stop Enerjak, by destroying him! In the back up story, it tells us about Dr. Finievus's origin and his reign of terror on the echidna population.</p><br /><br /><p>In Issue 183, Julie-Su and Locke agrue over that they should save Knuckles or destroy him.

As Jessica question's Fury's reason for being there, a flashback occurs one year before. <a href=\"/killer-shrike/29-12067/\">Killer Shrike</a> (Simon Maddicks) is in custody after having been apprehended by <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> and <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>. In custody, Maddicks quickly finds out that the cops are Shield agents and after interrogating him violently, Maddicks quickly agrees to tell them everything. Maddicks leads Shield to his tech benefactor. Unfortunately Maddicks benefactor who is revealed to be the <a href=\"/tinkerer/29-3144/\">Tinkerer</a>, who catches on to Maddicks betrayal and activates a booby trap giving him enough time to escape and results in Maddicks being seriously wounded.</p><p>Later the Shield agents raid the place but discover the tech of other super villains and four old passports with different names. Fury then gets a call from <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> who tells Fury that she has found the Tinkerer in <a href=\"/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a>. Fury later meets his superiors to notify them of the conspiracy he has found. Fury tells them about tech being made for various super villains that cost a lot more then the money they get from attempting to steal. Fury then reveals that the Tinkerer has been making tech for various super villains in the U.S but is getting funding him self from Latveria making the actions of the Super villains terrorism. Fury recommendation of action is rejected by his superiors who say that the United States has a good relationship with Latveria and wish to not take action but handle things diplomatically. Shocked, Fury storms out of the room where Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine asks him what is he gonna do? The story then continues to the present day as Fury looks over the body of Luke Cage and says \"What have I done\".</p><p>One year ago, Fury approaches <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> at his apartment resting after a mission. Fury requests for Caps help and tells him that it's \"Big\". Cap offers to assemble the other avengers but Fury says he needs this one to be a secret. Meanwhile elsewhere, <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> returns to his office as Matt Murdock and smells Fury at his office. After recruiting Daredevil, Fury then meets Luke Cage who just busted a drug seller. Shortly after <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> swings back home to find Fury sitting down with <a href=\"/mary-jane/29-13380/\">Mary Jane</a>. Fury then tells Peter that he needs Peter Parker and not Spider-Man.</p><p>The next day Peter goes to the airport and boards a plane and finds him self sitting next to Matt Murdock. The two are trying to figure out what is going on when <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> causes a scene at the back of the plane due to being drunk. His obscene behavior is put to an end by Steve Rogers aka Captain America. The plane then takes off and arrives at Latveria. The heroes Fury are recruited (except for Steve Rogers who goes off with the Latverian government) are greeted at the Latverian air port by Natasha Romanov aka Black Widow and with them another teenage girl follows, they all meet where Fury reveals him self to them. He then informs the heroes of the conspiracy he has discovered and tells them that he recruited them to help him overthrow the government. The story then continues to the present day, as Fury watches Luke sadly, Captain America burst in and punches Fury yelling \"Damn you for what you did to us!!!!!\"</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"420879\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/420879-10secretwar_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"420879\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/420879-10secretwar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>In the present day, Peter Parker is having his anniversary with Mary Jane but keeps getting visions in his head of a fight occurring in Latveria involving him and the other heroes Fury recruited fighting soldiers with tech similar to that of previous Super villains.

Peter also knows that the fight hes seeing happened in Latveria but he recalls never having been there before. Daredevil tells Peter that he knows nothing about the visions, Matt then gets a call from Jessica Jones who tells Matt that Luke is in the Hospital. As Spidey and Daredevil are about to leave they are ambushed by <a href=\"/diamondback/29-25689/\">Diamondback</a> and <a href=\"/scorcher/29-25579/\">Scorcher</a>. Spidey and Daredevil make quick work of them and make their way to the hospital.

The heroes are then attacked by an army of super villains. Meanwhile back at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a> Wolverine is drinking quietly until he is attacked. Back at the hospital, the heroes fight the massive amount of super villains as best they can. As they are about to be beaten, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> arrive and back them up but not long after the super villains tech suddenly malfunction and the energy is transferred into an Android Lucia Von Bardes. The heroes attack her under Fury's orders but are unable to penetrate her force field. Cap then orders the heroes to cut the line by damaging the tech worn by the army of super villains that she is getting her energy from. The plan fails however and Lucia charges up her energy to create a large explosion.</p><p>As Lucia charges her energy she yells angrily at Fury blaming him for everything. Before she can make her attack her mechanical heart suddenly explodes and after a backlash explosion she is defeated. The heroes pick them selves up and discover that the teenager named Daisy Johnson mentioned before one year ago had defeated her. The <a href=\"/black-bird/49-29269/\">Black Bird</a> arrives with Wolverine and the other X-Men. Cap demands Fury to tell them what had happened one year ago on that present day which was the \"Secret War\". Fury reveals that the heroes he recruited helped him attack Latveria. The heroes who had been previously recruited fought there way to Castle Von Doom to confront the Prime Minister <a href=\"/lucia-von-bardas/29-61288/\">Lucia Von Bardas</a>. The heroes are surprised to find out that they weren't officially allowed to attack Latveria and are even more shocked as Fury orders <a href=\"/quake/29-43174/\">Daisy Johnson</a> to bring down the whole castle which she agrees.</p><p>The heroes survive the destruction of Castle Von Doom but are disgusted at what Fury had done. Back in the present day, Spider-Man asks Fury why none of them remember this in which Fury reveals he mind-wiped them so none of them would remember and Cap only got back his memories when he did his regular Shield check up. Fury justifies his actions saying that he could not allow his superiors to do nothing and believed that what he did was the right thing to do. Wolverine flies into a rage for being mind-wiped again and strikes Fury directly and continue to slashes him. Wolverine then gets taken down by Daisy Johnson who explodes Wolverines heart knowing he'll live.</p><p>Daisy then reveals to the heroes that what Wolverine sliced was a <a href=\"/life-model-decoy/18-42286/\">Life Model Decoy</a> and that the real Fury had left several minutes after Lucia Von Bardas was defeated. From afar, Fury apologizes to the heroes for what he did through the LMD and says that they won't be seeing him again. The story later shifts to Daisy Johnson who is being interrogated by <a href=\"/maria-hill/29-40824/\">Maria Hill</a> who is now the new director of Shield on the whereabouts of Nick Fury. Daisy tells her she doesn't know and is yelled at to leave. As Daisy walks on to the platform of the Helicarrier she gets a call in which she says \"yes sir\" leaving readers to believe that she does know the whereabouts of Nick Fury.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-secret-war/37-189760/\">Secret War HC</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-secret-war/37-193344/\">Secret War TPB</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-your-universe-saga-/37-137832/\">Marvel: Your Universe Saga #1</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-mega-/37-292097/\">Marvel M\u00e9ga #19</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-mega-/37-292099/\">Marvel M\u00e9ga #21</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-mega-/37-292104/\">Marvel M\u00e9ga #25</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pulse-/37-297473/\">The Pulse #6</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pulse-/37-297474/\">The Pulse #7</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pulse-/37-297475/\">The Pulse #8</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pulse-/37-297476/\">The Pulse #9</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-/37-293108/\">Secret War #1</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-/37-293109/\">Secret War #2</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-/37-293110/\">Secret War #3</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-/37-293111/\">Secret War #4</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-/37-293112/\">Secret War #5</a> (German)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-de-los-archivos-de-nick-furia-/37-293106/\">Secret War: De Los Archivos De Nick Furia #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-war-obra-completa-/37-293107/\">Secret War: Obra Completa #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-guerra-segreta/37-337554/\">Super-Eroi Le Grandi saghe</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-guerra-segreta/37-337554/\">#5</a><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supereroi-le-grandi-saghe-guerra-segreta/37-337554/\">: Guerra Segreta</a> (Italian)</li></ul>",

Hawkeye not bothering to explain herself shoots Iron Man with a EMP arrow that shuts down the suit (for more, see <a href=\"/iron-man-armor/18-50749/\">Iron Man Armor</a>).  The two young Avengers then attempt to escape but are stopped by Clint Barton dressed as Captain America.  Patriot and Kate who are offended by the impostor and demand an explanation but Clint defends him self saying that Kate had named her self Hawkeye.  Kate, not knowing that the impostor is Clint, says that she took the name to honor the hero and if he was alive would call her self something else.  Hearing this Clint feels remorse having used his old friends name and allows the <a href=\"/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a> to escape as Iron Man arrives.  Clint then tells Tony that he will no longer be Captain America and tells Tony that he deals with his grief by bargaining, hoping that with Clint as Captain America t pain would be less. As Clint walks away, Tony warns him that he will arrest him if he joins the New Avengers.  Tony is then left alone in the rain, holding Captain America's Shield.  </p> <a></a><h2>Depression</h2> <p>Following Peter Parker leaving the Sanctum after fighting with Wolverine, stands infront of his <a href=\"/uncle-ben/29-3114/\">Uncle Ben</a>'s grave.  Over the grave Peter recalls all the previous people he has lost in his life <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\">Gwen Stacy</a>, Uncle Ben, <a href=\"/harry-osborn/29-2478/\">Harry Osborn</a> and now Captain America and Peter's blame him self over the role he played in Captain America's death during the <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>.  At that moment his Spider-Sense tingles and Peter finds the <a href=\"/rhino/29-2126/\">Rhino</a>. Without thinking Peter quickly attacks the Rhino who then defends him self. During the fight Rhino breaks his own mothers grave stone and in rage continues to attack Peter who is stunned to find out that he had made a rash and wrong judgment.  As the fight continues, Peter recalls one of his fights with the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, as the Hulk was about to crush Peter,he is saved by Captain America and the two are able to defeat the Hulk.  Upon realizing that Captain America would not come to save him this time, Peter defeats the Rhino and is joined by Wolverine who had been stalking him since their fight wanting to make sure Peter gets home safe. Peter who wants to be left alone leaves Wolverine and goes to the bridge where Gwen Stacy had died. Wolverine joins him shortly after and tries to comfort Peter, but Peter says that Wolverine has no idea what he is going through.  Wolverine then describes in words how Peter feels and then explains to Peter its called \"depression\" because its \"depressing\" but life gets better. With that Peter says \"Someday\" and swings away into the rain.  </p> <a></a><h2>Acceptance</h2> <p>Thousands of mourners and fans have gather at the Nations Capital to attend the funeral of Captain America who's body is being buried in Arlington National Cemetery where Ben Grimm, <a href=\"/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>, Iron Man, <a href=\"/rick-jones/29-2248/\">Rick Jones</a>, Ms. Marvel, The <a href=\"/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a> bring carry Captain America's casket.  His body is put to rest over a large statue of Captain America sculptured by <a href=\"/alicia-masters/29-4337/\">Alicia Masters</a>.  Later, Tony speaks for Captain America but upon standing there can not bring him self to say the words and leaves saying \"it wasn't suppose to be like this\" in which Ben Grimm roles his eyes.  The next speaker is Sam Wilson who tells everybody the honor he had in being Captain America's partner.  Sam then asks everybody who was saved by Captain America in World War 2 and the heroes Captain America teamed with in World War 2.  Sam then tells them how amazing it is that everybody here is of a different raise but have all been united by Captain America at this day.  Elsewhere, the <a href=\"/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a> watch the funeral on TV and are saddened by the idea that they could not attend their friends funeral.  Three days later in the Artic, Iron Man, Hank Pym and <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a> bring the real Captain America's body and reveals that the one in Arlington is fake for the public.  As Tony tells Captain America the things he could not say in Arlington he is interrupted by Namor.  Namor arrival was arranged to bring Captain America's body back to the seas where he was first found.  Namor then swears that no one shall disturb Captain America's peace while he still rules the seas.  Captain America's casket can then be seen sinking deep into the ocean.&nbsp;</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/captain-america-omnibus/49-30733/\">Captain America Omnibus</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america-fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america-tpb/37-127434/\">Fallen Son, The Death of Captain America</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-legends-incredible-new-iron-man-saga-begins/37-248780/\">Marvel Legends #50</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-legends-/37-246657/\">Marvel Legends #51</a></li></ul>",

Meanwhile, Jordan returns to the newly reconstructed Coast City to investigate the appearance of his old apartment building. As he holds up his Lantern power battery he sees the reflection of his Parallax version. The Parallax version of himself confronts him saying that together they had brought Coast City back. Parallax then engages in a battle of wills with the Spirit of Vengeance bonded to Jordan\u2019s soul.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"420261\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/420261-16GL_super.jpg\" title=\"The Spirit of Parallax confronts Hal Jordan\"><img id=\"420261\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/16263/420261-16GL_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Spirit of Parallax confronts Hal Jordan\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Spirit of Parallax confronts Hal Jordan</div></div></div></div><p>The Spirit then explains to Jordan the truth about Parallax, while at the same time on the Moon, Rayner does so to Green Arrow. Kyle had journeyed to the edge of the universe, and on the tenth planet from the star Pagallus, the inhabitants revealed that Parallax was a yellow demonic parasitic entity that was born at the beginning of sentience and fed on fear therefore creating terror in anything it came into contact with which caused entire civilizations to destroy themselves out of paranoia and fear of each other. The Guardians of the Universe then imprisoned the creature within the Central Power Battery on Oa. There Parallax laid dormant for billions of years, and his true nature was kept a secret by the Guardians to avoid anyone from trying to free it, and thus, it had eventually come to be referred to as simply \u201cthe yellow impurity\u201d. Parallax weakened its power over the corresponding spectrum, therefore explaining the Green Lanterns' weakness against yellow.</p><p>However, Parallax was soon awakened and reached out to Jordan through Jordan's own ring when Jordan was at his weakest and spent years subtly influencing him. After the destruction of Coast City, Parallax was able to gain full control over the grief stricken Jordan and was completely freed. When Jordan destroyed the Central Power Battery it grafted itself onto Jordan\u2019s soul. When Hal had become the Spectre, the Spirit of Vengeance drew in Jordan's soul, as it explains to Jordan, in order to eradicate the parasitic Parallax from it. All of a sudden Green Arrow and Rayner are then attacked by Sinestro, who explains that it was he who used his yellow power ring to tap into Parallax\u2019s power and awakened it, and that the Sinestro that was killed was an illusionary construct of Parallax, so that his murder would serve as the final stage of Jordan's transformation into the impurity in order to break his will.</p><p>The Justice League of America, Justice Society of America, and the Teen Titans arrive in Coast City and engage in a battle with Parallax but are defeated. The Spirit of Vengeance, however, manages to overpower Parallax, and removes the parasite from Jordan\u2019s soul. Parallax then transfers itself onto Ganthet.</p><p>Back at the watchtower, Green Arrow and Kyle Rayner fight Sinestro but are unable to win. At this point Hal Jordan's fingers in the coffin begin to move and his white hair disappears. His thoughts clear for the first time in a long time, and Hal emerges from the coffin. Resurrected as a mortal human again, he tells Sinestro to back away from Kyle and Green Arrow. Sinestro and Hal fight each other and eventually Hal is victorious and forces the renegade back into the antimatter universe. Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Guy Gardner and Kilowog return to Coast City and release Ganthet from the possession of Parallax. They then once again imprison the parasitic entity in the central power battery on Oa.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-rebirth/49-49259/\">Green Lantern: Rebirth</a></li><li><a href=\"/absolute-green-lantern-rebirth/49-37529/\">Absolute Green Lantern: Rebirth</a></li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/green-lantern-rebirth-1-special-edition/49-32496/\">Green Lantern: Rebirth Special Edition</a></li></ul><h2>Non-U.S. Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-premium-green-lantern-wiedergeburt/37-287414/\">DC Premium #39</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/37-290514/\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento #1</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/37-290515/\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento #2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/37-290516/\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento #3</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lanterna-verde-renascimento-/37-290517/\">Lanterna Verde: Renascimento TPB</a></li></ul>",
