        "description":"<h2>Origin &amp; History</h2> <p>The Odin force was first created when <a href=\"/odin/29-3507/\">             Odin</a> and his two brothers <a href=\"/vili/29-31574/\">             Vili</a> and <a href=\"/ve/29-12910/\">             Ve</a> tried to take down <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/surtur/29-10967/\">             Surtur</a> after they had finished taking down The frost giant, <a href=\"/ymir/29-10267/\">             Ymir</a>. When they go there, they tell the fire people that they have come to learn the undiscovered. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/odin/29-3507/\">             Odin</a> asks Surtur if its true that he would one day destroy the nine worlds. Surtur answers him yes and explains how he shall do it using his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sword-of-doom/18-48502/\">             Sword Of Doom</a> and the <a href=\"/eternal-flame/18-56058/\">             Eternal flame</a>. Odin remarks back&nbsp; \"Wouldn't it be better it the flame was taken out and the sword broken?\". Surtur then returns saying&nbsp; \"The flame cannot be extinguished but they could try to break his sword\". Surtur would then slam his fist on the ground as demons started to come from all corner then the brothers Vili and Ve would summon the raging storms of the arctic to stop the demons. It worked and started to freeze them. <br /><br />Next the three brothers joined into one to battle Surtur. As the battle went on they found out they couldn't best Surtur so they made one final blow which broke Surtur's sword. Vili one of the brothers states it to be a victory while Odin simply says that he will come after them. Ve then would cut down the flame of destruction so that even if Surtur were to reforge his sword he could not kindle it with the flame so that the world wouldn't end. Odin then starts to run to the portal to the nine worlds then releases his brothers who aren't following. One of the brothers says that if they go Surtur shall follow, then suddenly as Surtur emerges from the brimstone lake, a blast would come knocking Odin out of the realm Muspelheim and knocked him out as well. When he had awoken, the entrance to the realm was gone and he had the combined powers of the his brothers which made the Odin Force, however he knew his brothers were dead.</p><a> </a> <h2>Fe<b>ats</b></h2> <ol><li>Helped <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">             Thor</a> dent <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">             Captain America</a>'s <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/18-50737/\">             shield</a></li><li>Odin used it to create a galaxy then destroy it</li><li>With The Odin Force, Thor takes two nukes out of his chest without injury</li><li>Kills Captain America while destroying his shield</li><li>Kills <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">             Wolverine</a> while destroying him and his <a href=\"/adamantium/18-40759/\">             Adamantium</a> bones.</li><li>Thor has used the Odin Force to cure a man of his terminal cancer.</li><li>Thor has used the Odin Force to stop time itself.&nbsp;</li><li>Odin used it to cut out the heart of a star, with which it was used to forge and empower the legendary hammer Mjolnir.&nbsp;</li><li>Odin used it to bring back to life both Thor and Brunnhilde.(Valkyrie)</li><li>By channeling the Odin Force into his sacred hammer Mjolnir, Thor decapitated the nigh-invincible Destroyer Armor with one strike.&nbsp;</li><li>Thor used the Odin Force to not only become the supreme ruler of Earth itself, but also eliminate all of its hero's and villains that opposed him.</li><li>Odin used it to transform the cursed Nibelling rings into the gigantic Oversword of Asgard.(now known as the Odinsword)&nbsp;</li><li>Thor used it to destroy the Blood Axe of Skurge the Executioner, stating that only the Odin Force was capable of doing so.&nbsp;</li><li>Thor used the Odin Force to restore not only the floating city of Asgard on Earth, but also restored the lives of all the Asgardians who were lost after Ragnarok.&nbsp;</li><li>Odin used it to create and empower Stormbreaker, the hammer of Beta Ray Bill.&nbsp;</li><li>Odin used it to create and empower the Uru mace Thunderstrike, as a gift to Eric Masterson for all his heroic efforts in Asgard's name.&nbsp;</li><li>Odin used it to trap Surtur within his own body, becoming a living prison for the fire Elemental.&nbsp;</li><li>Odin used it to save the life of Eric Masterson by merging his life force with that of Thor's.</li></ol>",

They are also used to narrate other sides of a character that may not be possible in the main story arc.</p><p>An alternate universe is also referred as an alternate time-line, or alternate future. The alternate futures are possible futures which could happen depending on the actions of the past. However, these futures may actually be separate universes in a what-if scenario.</p><p>The Age of Apocalypse is an example of an alternate universe where Professor Xavier was accidentally killed by his own son, Legion when he went back in time to kill Magneto. As a result, Apocalypse ruled this altered timeline in which Xavier had never founded the X-Men.</p><p>Alternate Universes are generally very short lived and often created to demonstrate a 'what if' scenario. The Marvel <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/what-if/49-4249/\">What If?</a> volumes as well as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/39-40611/\">Marvel Zombies</a> are a good example of this. The comics describing the alternate universes are usually short, and after they are narrated, they disappear.</p><p>Alternate universe was also shown on the TV series called Sliders where the four sliders travel to each parallel Earth. These parallel Earths have their own alternate histories which would lead to the present day changes. However, the time travel wasn't involved in creating these alternate universes.</p><p>A Parallel Universe is more of a static. An example of this may be an 'opposite' universe, in which the good guys are the bad guys, and the bad guys the good guys. Parallel Universes may be described in mini-arcs, or they may only exist in another Alternate Universe.</p><p>Leading up to the year 2000 <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chaos-comics/57-1864/\">Chaos! Comics</a> devised a 2 year story arc for all its characters where by all the story-lines of the main characters converged around a single story thread that culminated int he total destruction of their universe. In the year 2000 the Chaos Comics universe was remade by a single character who devised 8 worlds and placed each of the main characters into these worlds, reborn for their stories to continue afresh.</p>",

Mutations manifest in varied and unexpected ways, and mutants may or may not look different than normal humans. A mutation will grant a member of the homo superior species either a <b>psionic</b> or <b>physical</b> ability or some combination thereof. Variations in <i>appearance</i> include abnormal body color, excessive hair or fur, disproportionate or additional limbs, extra appendages (such as tails, wings, or tentacles), textured skin (such as rock or scales) or an animal-like appearance.

The theory of the omega-level power was explained in the limited series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-forever/49-26670/\">X-Men: Forever</a>.</p><p>It explained current human population in the Marvel Universe are the result of experiments by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> eons ago. They were attempting to create humanity and have them evolve into new beings. Those that have achieved Omega-Level powers are nearing the final stage of evolution and often pass along this trait to their progeny.</p><p>The most common listing of qualities needed by these mutants is that they must have unlimited potential, be able to utterly control a substance (examples include ice, matter and energy) and that they can live beyond their physical form. However another way they can be judged to be Omega-level is if they are capable of hosting the Phoenix Force. Be aware, all these are speculations, there are no actual rules for what being an Omega means.</p><p>The confirmed Omega-level mutants that are cited below include:</p><ol><li>Absolom Mercator : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-m/29-40602/\">Mr. M</a></li><li>Gabriel Summers : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vulcan/29-21233/\">Vulcan</a></li><li>Robert Drake : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a></li><li>Jean Grey : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a></li><li>Joshua Foley : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a></li><li>Franklin Richards : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a></li><li>Quentin Quire : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-omega/29-40583/\">Quentin Quire</a></li><li>Rachel Summers : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-girl/29-3566/\">Marvel Girl</a></li><li>David Charles Haller : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion/29-13349/\">Legion</a></li><li>Nathan Grey : <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a></li><li>Hope Summers: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope</a></li></ol><p><b>Comics in Which Omegas Are Confirmed</b></p><ol><li>Mr. M shows spectacular displays of power throughout his few appearances but in is in X-Men: The 198 #2 that Val Cooper tells the X-Men that he is indeed an Omega-level mutant.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Power Cosmic is a limitless power that can allow the user to do many things such as resurrect the dead, manipulate the user\u2019s size and mass, teleportation, telepathy, creation of force fields, travel through time, superhuman strength, immortality and much more. The Power Cosmic can be used in a powerful blast or in small doses to change the color of a plant. The Power Cosmic can also be infused into the human soul giving them a portion of the Powers of the Universe.</p><p>The greatest and most powerful wielder (and perhaps source) of the Power Cosmic would be <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>, the Devourer of Worlds. He is rumored to be able to teleport entire galaxies throughout time and space, re-shape worlds that have been destroyed in every detail, and even create life. Galactus can and often does bestow a small fraction of the Power Cosmic to his <a href=\"/heralds-of-galactus/65-40462/\">Heralds</a>, most notoriously the Silver Surfer who has used it to rid mutants abilities (either temporarily or permanently).</p><p>Galactus however can give and take away the Power Cosmic at will.</p><p>With the Power Cosmic comes a cosmic sense. It allows anyone imbued with the power to almost be one with processes of the universe. The <a href=\"/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> once described it as being able to \"hear the cosmic static of the universe's electromagnetic fields and detect the pain of dying stars or the rhapsody of planets aborning\".</p><p>The Power Cosmic originates from the <a href=\"/astral-plane/34-54190/\">Astral Plane</a>.</p><h3>The Old Power</h3><p>The <a href=\"/old-power/12-55874/\">Old Power</a> is an attempt by the Shadow Priests to recreate the Power Cosmic. This was only partially successful as the Old Power is unstable.</p><h2><b>Wielders of the Power Cosmic</b></h2><p>Galactus is the bestower of the Power Cosmic, He seems to be the only Living source of the power cosmic. He can manipulate every organism and the only way to sate his hunger is to eat a living core of planets crust, thus devouring the chosen Planet.</p><h3><b>Given by Galactus</b></h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galacta/29-59459/\">Galacta</a>: Galacta is Galactus' biological daughter and like both her Father and Tyrant she is one of the most powerful wielders of The Power Cosmic in existence. But unlike Galactus and Tyrant, she never uses her powers to harm anything other than alien infestations both microscopic and macroscopic in origin. The reason she does this is to keep her adopted home world, Earth, and it's inhabitants safe.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tyrant/29-7123/\">Tyrant</a>: Tyrant has been called Galactus' \"son\" and was bestowed more of the Power Cosmic than any other herald. After a conflict with Galactus, he was reduced in power but still shown to be stronger than any other herald.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a>: Norrin Radd is the best known Herald of Galactus, and the Power Cosmic has granted him such abilities as superhuman strength, immortality, cosmic awareness, energy and molecular manipulation as well as the ability to fly faster than the speed of light.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/air-walker/29-7126/\">Air-Walker</a>: Though the original Air-Walker, Gabriel Lan, was favored the android that replaced him after he gave his life for Galactus was unfavored as he did not share the same passion. But the original was given superhuman strength and durability as well as an immunity to the vacuum of space by the Power Cosmic.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firelord/29-7108/\">Firelord</a>: Pyreus Kril was yet another Herald of Galactus and friend of Air-Walker, the Power Cosmic bestowed upon him, flight, superhuman strength and the ability to channel cosmic flame.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terrax/29-2106/\">Terrax</a>: The Herald known as Terrax the Tamer, was gifted with superhuman strength, stamina, durability and reflexes along with superluminal flight, blast power and the ability to manipulate earth.</p><p><a href=\"/frankie-raye/29-11605/\">Nova</a>: Frankie Raye of Earth volunteered to serve a weakened Galactus and was only given a minimal amount of the Power Cosmic due to his depleted state.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morg/29-7122/\">Morg</a>: Morg the Executioner was endowed with the Power Cosmic, and from this was given superhuman strength and the ability to channel energy through his axe.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-shift/29-40878/\">Red Shift</a>: Red Shift also received the Power Cosmic from Galactus and so was superhumanly strong and durable as well as immunity to the vacuum of space, the ability to open dimensional rifts and swords supplied with cosmic power.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a>: When Johnny Storm was temporarily imbued with the Power Cosmic he gained the ability to understand absolutely anything he analyzed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-ray/29-40974/\">Alpha Ray</a>: A biomechanical being Galactus infused with the Power Cosmic.</p><p><a href=\"/plasma/29-11596/\">Plasma</a>: Herald of Galactus in the <a href=\"/heroes-reborn/39-55955/\">Heroes Reborn</a> world.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stardust/29-7491/\">Stardust</a>: Lambda-Zero was given the Power Cosmic by Galactus resulting in the power to manipulation cosmic energy emerging.</p><p><a href=\"/praeter/29-80329/\">Praeter</a>: Christian Pastor from Oklahoma and newest herald of Galactus.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>: At one point, Galactus made Superman his Herald, removing his cape and sheathing him in gold. With the Power Cosmic Superman's natural powers were enhanced a great degree, including space travel. A host of new powers were also granted to him including firing powerful energy blasts, teleportation, unleashing a blast from his whole body, which was used to blast <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a> of him, cosmic awareness, and probably a whole host of other abilities that were never revealed, as he soon betrayed Galactus. However when Superman did have the Power Cosmic, Galactus said that he was his most powerful Herald ever. (see: Superman/Fantastic Four #1)</p><p><a href=\"/cosmic-hulk/29-68919/\">Cosmic Hulk</a>: This version of Hulk is a robot created by the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/29-2131/\">Mad Thinker</a>. Once, instead of having heralds, Galactus had a data loop program that wandered the universe, compelling beings to create artificial life forms that would one day help Galactus consume their planet.</p><h3>Given by Silver Surfer</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-universe/29-27193/\">Captain Universe</a>: The Silver Surfer permanently infused a portion of The Power Cosmic into The <a href=\"/uni-power/12-44362/\">Uni-Power</a> and repaired both its severe memory loss and power fluctuations.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shalla-bal/29-7125/\">Shalla Bal</a>: She was granted a portion of the Silver Surfer's power. She has the able to grow life wherever she steps. She can also call out to the Surfer for assistance through her thoughts.</p><p><a href=\"/silver-skyriders/65-56736/\">Silver Skyriders</a>: In another universe, twelve pieces of the Silver Surfer bestowed his power on twelve aliens forming the Silver Skyriders.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skaar/29-48518/\">Skaar</a>: Silver Surfer showed him what was like when a mortal reaches for the power of Gods, so he shows him the Power Cosmic by fusing with him. Surfer then talks to Skaar about decisions that would change his life forever, but Skaar has a different point of view.</p><p><a href=\"/earl-weygand/29-64821/\">Earl Weygand</a>: The Silver Surfer gave half of his Power Cosmic to Earl in order for him to help defeat the <a href=\"/enslavers/65-56863/\">Enslavers</a>. This turned Earl into a Silver Surfer himself. He was able to destroy the power supply of the ship, but it cost him his life.</p><h3>Taken from a wielder</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>: Victor Von Doom did for a time steal the Power Cosmic from Silver Surfer but he lost it when he interacted with Galactus.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doombots/29-11924/\">Doombot</a>: A robotic creation of Doctor Doom sent to absorb the Power Cosmic for himself once again. It was able to get the power but was destroyed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-hulk/29-56974/\">Red Hulk:</a> In battle with the Silver Surfer, the Red Hulk takes him and strangles him and before the Surfer even made a chance to move, Rulk absorbed every inch of the Power Cosmic in his body and kills Surfer. He then takes Terrax's axe and Surfers board but Galactus once again defeats Rulk. Grandmaster resurrects all of those killed by Rulk, including the Silver Surfer.</p><p><a href=\"/cosmic-messiah/29-64828/\">Cosmic Messiah</a>: The Cosmic Messiah was created with a combination of the <a href=\"/puppet-master/29-3799/\">Puppet Master's</a> radioactive clay and the Power Cosmic siphoned from the Silver Surfer by the <a href=\"/gangers/65-56849/\">Gangers</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a>: Ambushing the Surfer on Earth, the High Evolutionary completely siphoned the Power Cosmic from the Silver Surfer, leaving him a moral being again. Wyndam did not take all the power into himself, but used it as he needed and took control of one of Galactus' <a href=\"/galactus-ship/18-55839/\">Star Spheres</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/horacio-de-la-fuente/29-78549/\">Horacio de la Fuente</a> - A dying man given the Power Cosmic by the High Evolutionary.</p><p><a href=\"/suzi-endo/29-14223/\">Suzi Endo</a>: Suzi (also known as Cybermancer) was made herald to the High Evolutionary and changed with the Power Cosmic, much like the Silver Surfer was. She would come to be known as the Seeker.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Heroes Reborn</b></p><p>In the <a href=\"/heroes-reborn/39-55955/\">Heroes Reborn</a> world, the cosmic rays that gave the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> their powers was actually part of the Power Cosmic. The Heralds of Galactus were able to sense this in all four members.</p>",

The Power Ring enables its bearer to manifest their thoughts into hard-light constructs and other various properties only limited by the ring's amount of power and the user's willpower and imagination. The Power Ring is based on advanced technology rather than having its power magically derived.</p><p>Mainly, the ring is used for anti-gravity, to unleash torrents of energy, to translate alien dialects and to create hard-light constructs of any shape or complexity. Though, in the past, it has been unable to affect yellow-colored objects, this impurity has been overridden by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a>'s power of will.</p><p>The ring must be periodically charged by contact with a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-battery/18-55747/\">Power Battery</a> (a.k.a. Lantern) which in turn draws energy from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians Of The Universe</a>' <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/central-power-battery/18-55704/\">Central Power Battery</a> on the planet <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oa/34-41360/\">Oa</a>, the central headquarters of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a> at the center of the universe.</p><h2>Oath of the Green Lantern</h2><p><i>Though not necessary, many Green Lanterns recite an oath while re-charging their Green Power Ring. Some believe it aids them in re-affirming their strength of will. Recitation of the Oath takes an approximate equal amount of time required to recharge the ring. The most common oath used is as follows:</i></p><blockquote><p>In brightest day,</p><p>In blackest night,</p><p>No evil shall escape my sight,</p><p>Let those who worship evil's might,</p><p>Beware my power!</p><p>Green Lantern's light.</p></blockquote><h2>The Green Lanterns of Earth</h2><p>While the title of <b>Green Lantern</b> is bestowed upon anyone in the Green Lantern Corps there are several superheroes associated with the Earth in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-universe/12-40391/\">DC Universe</a> (and the sector designated as sector 2814).</p><h3>Alan Scott</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-scott/29-12663/\">Alan Scott</a> was the original Green Lantern, and unlike the others his title had nothing to do with the Corps. His powers are derived from a magical artifact called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starheart/18-47348/\">Starheart</a> rather than the advanced technology that makes up the Power Ring. Alan originally came from a parallel version of Earth known as Earth-2.</p><h3>Hal Jordan</h3><p>The first Green Lantern of DC's mainstream continuity's Earth, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a> was given his power ring by the dying Lantern <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abin-sur/29-22634/\">Abin Sur</a> when his spaceship crashed on Earth. Hal Jordan would be the first human Green Lantern of sector 2814. His first appearance was in Showcase #22 in 1959.</p><h3>John Stewart</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-stewart/29-10451/\">John Stewart</a> was chosen to become the Green Lantern of Earth after Hal Jordan gave up his position and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guy-gardner/29-1791/\">Guy Gardner</a> was injured.</p><h3>Guy Gardner</h3><p>When Abin Sur's spaceship crash-landed on Earth his Power-Ring logged <a href=\"/guy-gardner/29-1791/\">Guy Gardner</a> away as a \"backup\" Green Lantern of Earth. Guy became a full-fledged Green Lantern after John Stewart. Guy Gardner is now a part of the Honor Guard of the Green Lantern Corps.</p><h3>Kyle Rayner</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a> was selected by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ganthet/29-6951/\">Ganthet</a> to be the Green Lantern of Earth after Hal Jordan was infected by the demon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a>. For a short time he played the role of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ion/12-55697/\">Ion</a>, but has since then become a regular Green Lantern. Kyle Rayner is commonly referred to as the Torchbearer of the Green Lantern Corps.</p><h2>Other Notable Lanterns</h2><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/soranik-natu/29-42284/\">Soranik Natu</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kilowog/29-6952/\">Kilowog</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/salaak/29-11304/\">Salaak</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sodam-yat/29-46185/\">Sodam Yat</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mogo/29-41919/\">Mogo</a></b></p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chp/29-41359/\">Ch'p</a></b></p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Each member of the Green Lantern Corps is located by a green power ring for individuals that can overcome great fear. The Green Power Ring is able to perform a number of abilities which can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">Green Power Ring.</a></p><h2><b>Retconned</b></h2><p><b>Radiation:</b> Besides light based radiation used to create the energy constructs associated with a Green Lantern, the ring can simulate various forms of radiation. One example of this is the ability to simulate the radiation of Green <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kryptonite/18-32213/\">Kryptonite</a>, a form of radiation that is harmful to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>. However, this ability is no longer valid and has been retconned.</p><p><b>Time travel:</b> The ring allows the wielder the ability to travel through time, though the process requires great willpower.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p><b>Mental Incapacitation</b>: The ring cannot be wielded correctly if the wearer is under the influence of drugs or if there is an involvement of neural interference.</p><p><b>Yellow Impurity:</b> In the beginning the Green Ring was vulnerable to the color yellow. It was unable to defend against attacks from wielders of the Sinestro Corps as well. This weakness however has now be changed and can be overcome by veterans who have the ability to overcome great fear. Hal Jordan was of the first of the Green Lanterns to show that this weakness could be overcome.</p><p><b>Recharge</b>: Previously had to be recharged every 24 hours or when it has been depleted of energy. This can be accomplished if the bearer of the ring recites an oath into his power lantern while holding the ring to it. However now, the power ring only needs to be recharged when it runs out of energy. Sinestro stated to Hal that it was possible for a Green Lantern to store his.her battery in a pocket Universe and take it with them wherever they went but so far Hal has not displayed the ability to do this.</p><p><b>Red Lantern Corps</b>. Bearers of the red ring have the ability to drain a Green Power Ring of its energy. The ring of a Blue Lantern however has the ability to charge a Green Lantern Ring or negate this negative effect. Blue Lanterns rings also have the ability to purge the negative effects that a Red Lanterns Ring can cause upon the wielder of a Green Lantern Ring.</p><p><b>(Previous Weaknesses)</b></p><p><b>Ability To Kill</b>: One of the main weaknesses of the Power Rings that greatly disturbed Sinestro was the fact that the bearers of the Green Lantern Ring were unable to kill. Recently however, this restriction on the rings has been lifted but murder is still against the law of the GL Corps<b>.</b> This restriction was lifted by the Guardians of the Universe during the War of the Green Lanterns</p><h2>Related Articles</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">Green Power Ring</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-battery/18-55747/\">Green Power Battery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/central-power-battery/18-55704/\">Central Power Battery</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians Of The Universe</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/3600-sectors-of-space/34-56427/\">3600 Space Sectors</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ion/12-55697/\">Ion</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Sinestro Corps</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro/29-10448/\">Sinestro</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-blackest-night/39-55766/\">Blackest Night</a></li></ul>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Darkforce is an energy unique to the Marvel Multiverse. It constitutes the Darkforce Dimension and has the ability to assume the properties of both matter and energy depending on the needs of the user. It has been stated that Darkforce is a sentient property, often possessing or corrupting those who use it. Several characters in the Marvel universe have shown some ability to manipulate Darkforce, often with dramatically different results:</p><p><b>Use for Teleportation</b></p><p>Characters, such as the mutants <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak/29-1474/\">Cloak</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vanisher/29-6756/\">Vanisher,</a> are believed to make use of the Darkforce dimension to permit them to teleport distances. Characters enter the Darkforce Dimension, either through portals or direct teleportation, then vacate the Darkforce Dimension into some other (or in some instances, the same) location in the world.</p><p><b>General Manipulation</b></p><ul><li>The character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkstar/29-10990/\">Darkstar</a>, perhaps the strongest wielder of the energy, possesses the ability to directly manipulate Darkforce, allowing her to create solid objects, fly, and teleport. She has also been able to disable Vanisher's control over the Darkforce Dimension, closing a portal around his body when he once tried to escape her - cutting him in half.<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak/29-1474/\">Cloak</a> can open a portal into the Darkforce Dimension. He also has the ability to teleport himself and others wrapped in his cloak, and to instill fear into those he envelops. He has often felt that the dimension wishes to corrupt him.</li><li>On the other hand, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-mamba/29-30719/\">Black Mamba</a> uses Darkforce to create illusions which distract her opponents, often tapping into their greatest desire.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blackheart/29-14728/\">Blackheart</a> appears to live within the Darkforce Dimension, and as such has complete control over the energy.<br />Other characters who can manipulate Darkforce include: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asylum/29-2095/\">Asylum</a>, <a href=\"/blackout/29-11839/\">Blackout</a> (Daniels), <a href=\"/quagmire/29-44490/\">Quagmire</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doorman/29-2489/\">Doorman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ecstasy/29-30685/\">Ecstasy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightside/29-13970/\">Nightside</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadowoman/29-42522/\">Sepulchre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shroud/29-13844/\">Shroud</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silhouette/29-2119/\">Silhouette</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/smuggler/29-21992/\">Smuggler</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spot/29-18270/\">Spot</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightwind/29-10583/\">Nightwind</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/night/29-7537/\">Night</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mister-negative/29-49969/\">Mister Negative</a>.</li><li>Darkstar II and III were able to manipulate the Darkforce in a way similar to the original; this was achieved through DNA grafts given to them by the Russian Government. Despite these grafts, Darkstar II was still unable to completely control the energy, which led to her death.<br />It is sometimes thought that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> uses the Darkforce Dimension to teleport, but recent developments have shown that he instead uses The Brimstone Dimension.</li><li>The Wolverine foe <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/romulus/29-34477/\">Romulus</a> is currently trapped within the Darkforce Dimension, left there by Wolverine and Cloak.</li></ul>",

        "description":"The Kherubim are a race of aliens from the planet <a href=\"/khera/34-40910/\">Khera</a> and have an understanding of science that has allowed them to invent amazing technology. <br /><br /><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Technology on Khera</h2><span>Because the technology comes from <a href=\"/khera/34-40910/\">Khera</a>, some of the greatest examples of what the Kherubim have created is there, but since the planet has only been in the comics for one arc, there aren't many. When the <a href=\"/wildcats/65-25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a> visited the planet and couldn't speak the language, they were given patches that would allow them to instantly learn it. Language is encoded onto molecules on the patches so when they adhere to the skin, knowledge (of language in this case) can be transmitted through the blood to the brain. Locations all over Khera displayed creative uses for Kherubim technology. The WildC.A.T.s stayed at a place called Coincidental Mansion which demonstrated Kherubim technology capable of directly altering probability and chance for entertainment purposes. In the entire area in and around the mansion, bizarre and improbable happenings were more likely to take place thanks to a \"low probability field generator\". While the other WildC.A.T.s stayed at the Mansion, <a href=\"/zealot/29-11586/\">Zealot</a>, as leader of the <a href=\"/coda/65-40958/\">Coda</a>, stayed somewhere else. The base for the Coda was built in a desert called the Bay of Numbers. In the Bay, the grains of sand continually shaped and reshaped themselves into ever-changing geometric forms. Perfect spheres, cubes and other, seemingly random shapes would form out of the sand, but the order and placement of them never repeated (and never would for all eternity). Though Coincidental Mansion and the Bay of Numbers were just for decoration and entertainment, there are other Kherubim creations that serve more practical purposes. The most noticeble piece of Kherubim technology are the Spartan Guards. The Spartans are fully sentient robots that are built as personal bodyguards as well as a police force. Each Spartan has a \"brain\" more powerful than any other computer (on Earth or otherwise), is programmed to be able to use any technology it comes across, is equipped with powerful lasers, is skilled in armed and unarmed combat and has superhuman levels of strength, speed and durability. <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\">Spartan</a>, one of these androids, is a permanent member of the WildC.A.T.s and also shows up in several other comics. In the Majestic one-shot: <a href=\"/wildstorm-spotlight-majestic/49-18001/\">Wildstorm Spotlight: Majestic</a>, he gets so advanced that he becomes a god, a powerful example of the limits (or lack thereof) of Kherubim technology. Of all the Kherubim creations though, the Kheran Dream Engine may be the best. It can warp reality to make thoughts and dreams real.<br /><br /></span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Space Travel</h2><span>The Kherubim have ships built (or more accurately \"grown\") for interstellar flight and in some cases, faster than light travel. Most Kherubim ships are able to access and travel <a href=\"/the-bleed/34-41042/\">The Bleed</a>, allowing them to visit other dimensions. These ships (and the other battle ships) are outfitted with some of Khera's best weaponry and are so massive, they could be considered small cities. Even with the speeds the ships can reach, travel can still take a long time depending on the destination or purpose of the trip so stasis pods are on the ships to allow the crew to store their bodies safely during travel. While in stasis, the mind of a sleeping Kherubim is stored in a crystal should anything happen to them. Upon reaching their destination, the mind is returned to the brain and body it came from. If something should happen to the body during flight, the crystal can be stored until a new body can be made for the mind to be put into. (This was actually what happened with <a href=\"/majestrate/29-40691/\">Majestrate</a>.) Kheran ships have a unique control system that is operated by vocalizations. Kherans sing to their ships to get them to do what they want and the Kheran vocal range is different enough from other species (at least human and Daemonite) that they can't be piloted by non-kherans without extensive modification.<br /><br /></span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Weapons</h2><span>Though the Kherubim have awesome technology and a myriad of machines that can do their fighting for them, most choose to fight for themselves and use bladed weapons to do so. Just because the weapons are not as complex as guns and lasers though, doesn't mean they aren't as effecient as other Kherubim tools. Blades made by Kherubim technology (called Kusar Blades) are capable of cutting anything, even beings of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>/<a href=\"/mr-majestic/29-21972/\">Mr. Majestic</a> level durability. Sentient swords have been created that can deliver energy blasts as they strike (if the sword deems it necessary) as well as perform other tasks in the hands of a skilled swordsman. A sword like this is not common though, and only the highest ranking and most deserving are given weapons like this. Majestic owns another special blade that hasn't been seen before. It is a large sword capable of changing its shape (even changing from a blade to a completely different weapon like a spiked ball and chain) and also releasing energy blasts and electrical charges. The fluid way that the sword changes shapes suggests that it might have been created through study of the Shaper's Guild. There are also special weapons for stealth combat. Quantum-Folded Combat Blades are invisible and can be shrunk to the size of a cell phone and enlarged for combat. Skintight Nanoflage suits make the wearer invisible to all forms of surveillance and High-Dose Damper Capsules are pills that remove the powers of whoever ingests them so their energy signature is also undetectable.</span><span><br /><br />All this is not to say that Kherubim don't have other, more complex weapons. The Kherubim have energy weapons, forcefield technology, genetic bombs and weapons created for large-scale warfare and world take-overs, it's just that they are rarely needed since the Kherubim themselves are war machines. One weapon that Kherubim possess is the Low-Grav Wallcrawler. It most resembles a normal Earth tank (with more cannons) but it can transform into an even bigger machine almost capable of going head to head with a Spartan Guard. These machines appear to be semi-sentient, able to be piloted or left to act on their own. The Kherubim also have bio-chemical weapons, one of which is the Haikyatu Armory. According to <a href=\"/emp/29-21970/\">Emp</a> it has two stages. The first is a bacteria bomb that destroys the nerve centers of all forms of life while keeping the bodies intact. The second stage reanimates and controls the bodies, creating an army of undead. Of course there are also the lasers and mega-bombs that most advanced races seem to have, but the Kherubim try not to totally destroy their enemies when they fight in case something can be gained from keeping them alive.<br /><br /></span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Planet-Shapers</h2><span>Planet-Shapers are massive machines used for the colonization of new planets and the spread of Kherubim. The first Kherubim created Planet-Shapers, terraforming machines that could be sent to suitable planets and through a long process, would rebuild the Kherubim race there. The Planet-Shapers would land on a still-forming planet and stay dormant beneath the mantle until sentient life evolved on the planet. At this point, the Planet-Shaper would release Kherubim (made inside the machine from \"pure Kherubim gene-stock\" it carried) and the natural sentient race of the planet would be made into a servitor race. To ensure that the new Kherubim flourished, the Planet-Shapers would restructure climate and geographic conditions to best suit the Kherubim. Also, giant robots would come from the Planet-Shapers and kill most of the servitor race, thinning down their numbers so they would never pose a threat to the new Kherubim.<br />&nbsp;</span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Kherubim Technology on Earth</h2><span>The Kherubim have been on Earth for thousands of years and as a result, a lot of their technology has mixed with human technology. In the <a href=\"/majestic/49-18002/\">Majestic</a> series, <a href=\"/desmond/29-40665/\">Desmond</a>, a child genius, reverse-engineered a lot of Kherubim technology for personal use. He made suits that let him act like a superhero and rebuilt his legs so he could walk (he had been paralyzed from the waist down). After he gave up being a superhero he started to use the Kherubim technology for commercial profit. He started a company and created the Quickthink 4-Tell, a phone with instant messaging, video and holo-still, internet access, mp3, voice actuation, 4-D surround playback, simulcast conference capabilities and more for less than 100 dollars. He became a millionaire and he wasn't the only one. <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\">Spartan</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/wildcats/65-25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a>, used a mixture of Kherubim technology and <a href=\"/otherspace/34-41058/\">Otherspace</a> energy to in his own corporation. They sold batteries that lasted forever, cars that didn't need gas (and lasted forever) and computers that would never need to be upgraded or even plugged in. Other companies also used bits and pieces of Kherubim technology (though they didn't know it) and soon enough Earth was covered in \"xenotechnology\". In Wildcats v4, the latest volume, Spartan has begun to sell Spartan Guards as household tools and the world is eating them up.</span>",

The attack allows Wolverine to reach speeds much faster than he ever could on his own, causing him to do much more damage when he enters the battlefield. It also allows him get to areas that he couldn't before, such as extreme heights or distances. In the move, Colossus holds Wolverine in his hands and throws him with as much force as he can muster. Sometimes the throw is like a javelin and other times it looks like a baseball pitch, but the result is the same. The size difference between the two heroes involved makes this move easier than when it is tried with others. Colossus is very big so a small Wolverine fits right in his hand.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"88984\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88984-34641-fastball-special_super.jpg\" title=\"It's all in the arm\"><img id=\"88984\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88984-34641-fastball-special_medium.jpg\" alt=\"It's all in the arm\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">It's all in the arm</div></div></div></div><p>Though Colossus and Wolverine are known for the maneuver, it can work with almost any duo physically capable.

This is because the Speed Force is used mostly by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>'s throughout <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC</a> history and these are their symbols and colors. The Speed Force is sometimes referred to as the source of all speed, but it is sometimes imagined as a sort of location or dimension. All DC characters who are called speedsters are connected to the Speed Force regardless of the origin of their powers; it is said that when they die, speedsters become one with the Speed Force, something of a Valhalla for speedsters.</p><p>Not all DC <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/metahuman/12-55705/\">super-humans</a> with super speed are connected to the Speed Force, just the ones whose primary power is superhuman speed. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman,</a> though he is very fast, has no connection to the Speed Force. The same holds true for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lanterns</a>, who can traverse the galaxy at incredible speeds. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/max-mercury/29-2379/\">Max Mercury</a> discovered that it is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Barry Allen</a> himself who generates the Speed Force with every step that he runs. When he was struck by the bolt of lightning that gave him his powers, the Speed Force was created and echoed through time and every dimension. By running, Barry generates a kinetic wall between the present and the time barrier that manifests as electrical energy that touches every part of reality and contains the knowledge of every place and every time.</p><p>After Barry's death the Speed Force hasn't grown because he's the engine that generates the electrical energy that makes up the Speed Force. As Barry runs, the Speed Force grows and someone past, present of future is able to tap into it. It is a positively charged electrical energy and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-zoom/29-18340/\">Professor Zoom</a>'s Negative Speed Force is the negative, opposite charge.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1910096\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/103225/1910096-speedforce.png\" title=\"The Speed Force\"><img id=\"1910096\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/103225/1910096-speedforce_medium.png\" alt=\"The Speed Force\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Speed Force</div></div></div></div><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> event <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Bart Allen</a> grabbed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superboy-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy Prime</a> and tried running him into the speed force. When Jay Garick had to stop and Wally West disappeared, Bart Allen knew he could not push the villain into the speed force alone; Barry Allen, Max Mercury, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jesse-chambers/29-9345/\">Jesse Quick</a> then grabbed Superboy Prime and pulled him in.

When he died his spirit merged with the Speed Force even though it was also seen in Heaven. After Bart returned to Earth so that he could absorb the Speed Force, Barry gave his grandson his costume, choosing to remain within the Force. Professor Zoom, however, sensed his old enemy's return and sent a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to reawaken Barry's self awareness and bring him back to the physical world so he could engineer his revenge.</li><li>The second Kid Flash and fourth Flash, <a href=\"/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Bart Allen</a>'s powers came from the Speed Force, and at one time he wished to lose this connection, fearing the Speed Force. This was because during Infinite Crisis he was brought into the Speed Force where he aged four years and returned, only to absorb the Speed Force into himself, claiming it was gone. Recently he has been de-aged and become Kid Flash again.</li><li>The first Flash <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a>, originally couldn't even run at the speed of sound until he met Barry Allen and began to tap into the Speed Force. He could then run 20 times as fast. Despite this he was unable to keep up with the many speedsters when they entered the Speed Force to entrap Superboy-Prime and when Bart returned and absorbed the Speed Force, Jay's powers began to swiftly diminish. Eventually however, when Bart apparently met his demise, Jay's powers have returned to their full strength.</li><li><a href=\"/johnny-quick/29-36717/\">Johnny Quick</a>, to save his daughter's life, ran into the Speed Force, and merged with it. He somehow tapped into the Speed Force by visualizing a mathematical formula in his mind and saying it out loud.</li><li><a href=\"/jesse-chambers/29-9345/\">Liberty Belle</a> inherited her connection to the Speed Force from her father and his speed formula but has flip-flopped between using it or powers inherited from her mother. She has also gone by the name Jesse Quick.</li><li><a href=\"/max-mercury/29-2379/\">Max Mercury</a>, The 'Zen Master of the Speed Force' is a speedster from the past who jumped several times into the future until he arrived in the present. He was guardian to Bart Allen who had arrived from the future and understands the Speed Force probably better than anyone else. He could converse with spirits of those trapped in the Speed Force through meditation and ended up trapped there until Barry Allen brought him back.</li><li><a href=\"/reverse-flash/29-83879/\">Reverse-Flash</a> was sucked into the Speed Force and there he went insane after remaining there for 50 years. When he returned he wreaked havoc and eventually became a being of pure speed energy who has possessed the body of Max Mercury, thus condemning Max to the Speed Force.</li><li><a href=\"/savitar/29-48688/\">Savitar</a> developed powers from the Speed Force other speedsters had not, creating a cult based around himself. He murdered people in order to gain speed until Wally West forced him into the Speed Force. Shortly after Barry Allen returned from the Speed Force, Savitar used Barry as a doorway to engineer his own escape; however, Barry's touch caused Savitar to be consumed by the Negative Speed Force that Professor Zoom had infected Barry with.</li><li><a href=\"/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a>, the third Flash, his powers were connected to the Speed Force, a dimension he chose to live in during Infinite Crisis. He turned into a being of pure speed energy and came to his wife, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/linda-park-west/29-2394/\">Linda Park West</a> who grabbed onto him and so they and their children, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jai-west/29-46070/\">Jai West</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iris-west/29-46069/\">Iris West</a> vanished into the Speed Force. There they remained for many years, so that the twins could age without any pressure on their lives from Wally's superhero life.</li><li>Impulse, Iris West is the daughter of Wally West and Linda Park West. At first she and her twin brother Jai West shared a connection to the Speed Force and them fighting over it caused them to manifest unconventional powers for speedsters. During Flash: Rebirth she severed Jai's connection to the Speed Force and gained the full connection gaining traditional super speed and choosing to call herself Impulse. She is possibly Bart Allen's biggest fan.</li><li><a href=\"/xs/29-40802/\">XS</a>, a descendant of Barry Allen and cousin to Bart Allen, she is a superhero in the 31st century. She too is connected to the Speed Force.</li><li><a href=\"/black-flash/29-43141/\">The Black Flash</a> is a Grim Reaper of sorts for speedsters. When near death, all speedsters connected to the Speed Force must face the Black Flash and unless they are able to outrun him they die.

Professor Zoom himself is the engine that generates this Negative Speed Force with every step that he runs. He used it to infect Barry Allen in the hopes that the Negative Speed Force would consume Barry's loved ones and other speedsters who rely on it, consuming Barry in grief so that he'd merge with the Speed Force. Professor Zoom is currently being kept immobile in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-heights/34-41410/\">Iron Heights</a> Penitentiary to prevent him from generating the Negative Speed Force. However, Hunter Zolomon (the most recent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zoom/29-41085/\">Zoom)</a> is kept in the next cell, and believes working together they can be even more powerful, which may be bad news for both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/central-city/34-54995/\">Central</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/keystone-city/34-40924/\">Keystone</a> Cities.</p><h2>Powers</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"164906\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/164906-99146-speed-force.jpg\" title=\"Barry Using The Speed Force To Trap Superboy Prime\"><img id=\"164906\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/164906-99146-speed-force_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Barry Using The Speed Force To Trap Superboy Prime\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Barry Using The Speed Force To Trap Superboy Prime</div></div></div></div><p>The Speed Force serves as the primary measure of velocity in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-universe/12-40391/\">DC Universe</a>. They are usually referred to in terms of different barriers: The Sound barrier, Light barrier, Time Barrier, Dimensional Barrier, and finally the Speed Force Barrier. It introduced several \"new\" powers to Flash and other Speed Force-powered persons. Some of these powers had previously existed during the DC <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a>, but were later explained as manifestations of the Speed Force.</p><p>The Speed Force can be used to various effect including limited to time travel, faster-than-light travel, speed duplicates, constructs using Speed Force energy, faster healing and speed stealing or lending. It also provides speedsters the ability to function at unnatural speeds without the laws of physics stopping them. Those within the Speed Force are protected heat or bearing the brunt of impacts at any speed they travel. It also lets them breathe, receive stimuli (sight, hearing, etc.), and avoid completely destroying themselves and the world around them as they move.

Before she was able to finish a cure, MacTaggert succumbed to a mutated strain. Beast, however was able to combine their work and reverse engineer a strain of the virus that would essentially eradicate all other strains. Once this harmless version was airborne, the cure would spread around the world in a matter of days. Unfortunately, the virus only becomes airborne upon the death of an infected mutant. Therefore, Beast's cure would require one mutant to sacrifice his life to release the cure. Believing this to be too high a price to pay, Beast abandoned the cure and returned to the drawing board. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\"> Colossus</a>, however, never stopped mourning for his sister, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\"> Illyana Rasputin</a>, who was among the first victims of the Legacy outbreak.

Upon discovery of the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/18-55807/\">  Terrigen Crystals</a> which produce the mists, Randac exposed himself to the vapors they created giving him immense psychic abilities.  Randac wanted exposure to the Mists to be mandatory in Inhuman culture.  The results were often disastrous.  Many mutated into deformed monsters.  Others mutated into an to an offshoot race of the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\"> Inhumans</a>, the <a href=\"/alpha-primitives/12-23691/\">   Alpha Primitives</a>.  Alpha Primitives are mules of Inhuman society: sterile, stupid, and barely functional other than the menial tasks of keeping the machinery that runs the Inhuman city of <a href=\"/attilan/34-44155/\">   Attilan</a> running smoothly.  Because of the problems with Terrigenesis, the Genetic Council was charged with the task of managing Terrigenesis to ensure that Inhumans are genetically compatible with the process before exposure.<br /><br />Terrigenesis creates seemingly random mutations in those exposed, unlocking their genetic potential.  Each Inhuman responds to the process differently and varies in both appearance and powers gained.  Terrigenesis has become such a key aspect of Inhuman culture that it is considered sacred.  Much of the Inhuman religion and culture is centered around Terrigenesis.  It is considered a rite of passage for Inhuman children.  Upon reaching a certain age, children are put into classes where they are paired up with other children of the same age to learn about Inhuman society, religious tradition, and culture.  Graduation is in the form of the Terrigenesis, and is an important moment for both the individual and the entire family.  Mutations that are key to Inhuman society may be a cause for celebration for the entire race.</p><a> </a><h2>Exposure</h2><p>The process of Terrigenesis can be extremely dangerous despite rigorous control on the part of the Genetic Council.  Mutations very greatly in function and level of power.  Mutations vary in every way imaginable including energy forms, psychic mutations, plant and animal control, sonic control, healing, death, strength, blast powers, flying, elemental manipulation, mutation enhancement, and much much more.  Some of the least powerful Inhumans can do little more than change skin pigment.  Some of the more powerful can level mountains, kill with a gaze, or more.</p><p>The unlocking of genetic potential that occurs in Inhumans during Terrigenesis seems to be random in nature, based on the genetic code of the individual alone.  It has been revealed that through Terrigenesis Inhumans fulfill a greater destiny through Terrigenesis.  When viewed from a higher level, it is evident that Terrigenesis is not only to enhance the individual, but to adapt for the benefit of society in preparation of the future.  When an Inhuman with a mutation that is key to Inhuman society dies a replacement mutation occurs within a matter of three years.  Times of strife or conflict, or times of great climate change will facilitate mutations appropriate to the circumstances.</p><a> </a><h2>Compatibility</h2><p>Exposure by those who are not genetically compatible with Terrigenesis can be dangerous for those involved.  Disastrous mutations can occur and in some rare instances exposure can cause one to cease to exist (even if genetically compatible).  Exposure by humans results in Inhuman-like mutations, but the powers and abilities gained as well as the test subject do not last long.  The body rapidly begins to burn out and deteriorate.  This begins with rapid onset of some of the features of old age, and in later stages will leave little more than a corpse-like husk.

        "description":"<p>Here is a feature gallery where we will present some of the most memorable (and sometimes most horrible) advertisements ever to grace the pages of our beloved comic book medium. Peruse and enjoy this modern gallery of pulchritude and go away with a smile. Return again, bringing your own examples of advertising virtuosity from the comic Ages past. Our tour begins with those muscle-bound and true-to-life strongmen who inspired us to no longer be the wimp at the beach.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Charles Atlas, He'll Make a Man Out of You</h2><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Charles Atlas ruled the advertisement pages for years, becoming an icon in the eyes of young boys everywhere. Atlas was the living embodiment of the superhero physique, and proof that the \"90 lbs. weakling\" can grow up to kick butt and take names. He had the confidence to wear a leopard print bikini bottom and stand like he had a stuck up his rear, and managed to make it look cool. Thank you, Charles Atlas for sharing your pecks with the world.</p><p>Next stop on our tour, the wonderful world of action figures.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Get Some Action (Figures)</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>If you were a man-child of the 70's or 80's (and probably the 90's as well), you played with action figures. Let's face it guys, \"action figures\" are just what we call them so we can say we DON'T play with dolls, but the outcome is the same nonetheless. Above are two of the absolute coolest of the cool. Who in their right mind DIDN'T want a gold plated Cylon. And don't get me started on the Warrior action figure. He was the baddest @$$-kicker of them all.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>G.I. Joe had his own kickin' rescue and attack dog. Look at him go! Name another dog that can use a zip-line or keep tabs on the enemy via periscope. Look at the longevity of the G.I. Joe line. It's possible that you had some Joes passed down to you from a big brother, or maybe even a dad, and you might have passed them down to your own children. I know I did.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Does ANYBODY remember Major Matt Mason? I'm sure he was the coolest astronaut hero of his day, but looking back now I wonder what the \"tech\" designers for the toy line were thinking. Look at the \"wheels\" of that space crawler, and the flying treadmill \"space sled,\" that's some well-tested equipment there I'm sure. What's with the moon suit? It looks like more like a buoy out in New York harbor. ROM the Space Knight was SO much cooler. He even had his own (fairly) successful comic title for a short while, created just to boost toy sales. Remember when Forge built that gun based on ROM's Neutralizer for use on Rogue, but it ended up getting used on Storm and erasing her powers for years? Good times.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Quite possibly the best action figures EVAR, the Star Wars collection ruled the school playgrounds of America in the late 70s and early 80s. If you brought a new figure to school, you were the coolest cat for the day, at least until your playground nemesis brought another one hot off the shelf. Yet another set of figures to pass down to your children. Then there's Stretch Armstrong, an \"action figure\" you could stretch him as far as you wanted and he would snap back into his original shape. My friends and I actually snapped the head off of one of these things. I'm not kidding when I say that it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Suck It Up Soldier!</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Look at that high technology at work. Buy this green and brown face paint and you can become almost INVISIBLE. I love the line, \"Give you a SECRET advantage over your enemies.\" Yeah, like the people the US army fought in WWII and Korea didn't know how to smear paint on their faces. It's not so politically correct anymore it seems to play with little toy soldiers. I've had the hardest time finding them for my son when he wanted them. Back when some of us were children, you could just order the things out of any comic book any time. </p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>See that ad on the right above, I remember ordering that set of toy soldiers and thinking, \"I can't wait until that footlocker comes in, that's gonna be so cool.\" Yeah, right. Read the fine print stuck in there right above footlocker. What 8 year old boy is going to read the find print, or really even care what \"pasteboard\" is? I think that \"footlocker\" lasted a whole day.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>It's Alive! It's Alive!</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>You could order live animals through the mail? Real live animals? And since when is a RACOON America's favorite pet? Easy to care for? If you like rabies, I guess so.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Why is it so many of these live animals are coming out of Florida? Were they trying to make more room for geriatric retirees and hot girls?</p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Why do they keep putting those poor little animals in teacups? Do they come in a teacup? Is that even really safe. And why does that old woman keep calling us \"Friends?\"  I've never spoken with this woman ever, have you?</p> <br /><br /><p>OK, so this last one's really not a live animal, but tell me if you can resist. If you had an air bladder in your hand with an air tube running up your shirtsleeve nowadays, I wonder what people would think you're hiding. It STILL might have something to do with a snake (or not).</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>It Ain't Easy Being Green</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>How about some live plants in the mail to go along with your live animals? Read the fine print on the 2D Chia Pet wannabes: \"Purchase of $1 or more automatically makes you a member of the Lucky Clover Club. You receive a genuine four-leaf clover for good luck.\" Man, what a deal!</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Oh, How Novel!</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>I love the hokey buzz lines they use on these old things. \"Eyes will pop as friends gasp!\"</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>\"The most fantasmagorical hobby kit in the history of everything.\" What does that even mean? And \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" just sounds dirty.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Just imagine how much you could get on Ebay for one of those Gene Autry friendship rings. The 147 automobiles looks good, but notice the \"Garage.\" Yet another press board box.</p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Here's the trick section of the comic ads. How many kids fell for the \"$1 million\" gag because they didn't read the fine print to see that it was fake money? Aren't \"exact reproductions\" illegal? Maybe they made enough money off of the scam to pay their lawyers. Then you have the \"Lucky Grab Bag\" full of prizes, some of which were \"formerly up to $10.\" Read, \"this is leftover crap, and it's better to have you pay us a buck for it and clear out our warehouse.\"</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>\"Tell your parents every ingredient in the Margaret O'Brien Candy Kitchen is guaranteed to be absolutely wholesome.\" Yeah right. Those little bottles have just a slight resemblance to mini-bar bottles. The Vac-U-Form toys all look pretty good, but what's up with the bird and the cow?</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Look at the Texas Ranch scam. Somebody do the math for me and find out how many square inches are in an acre. I have a feeling that somebody made a killing off of their land. I mean, have you ever been to Amarillo, TX?</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>\"Kids, we'll give you a free toy if you buy our cereal. Yes, it tastes like crap, but you'll be having so much fun you'll never notice.\" In Junior's Television you have a real visionary at work. Who knew that just a couple of decades later we really would have rear projection TVs in our homes?</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Look at the \"Chinese\" guy up at the top of the magic tricks page. You couldn't get away with that kind of thing today, and that's a good thing.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>I want my money back! I ordered the X-Ray specs when I was a kid and all I got was a headache. I never once saw the black silhouette of a woman through her clothes.</p> <br /><br /><p>OMG! The Shocker?!?</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Win Fabulous Cash &amp; Prizes</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Who cares about the cars on the right, we've got Linda Carter in a Wonder Woman outfit. The contest was to finish a sentence in 50 words or less. Here's my entry: \"The daring rescue I would like to see Wonder Woman perform is...you and me alone together at the end. You're hot.\" I don't think I would have won.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Eat, Drink, and Be Merry...</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>I love the tag lines here. \"Hep cats purr over the fresh, clean taste of 7-Up.\" \"Delicious for folks of action!\"</p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>What?!? A guy named \"Captain Tootsie\" rescues a guy named \"Fatty\" after he jumps off of building with an umbrella? He probably would've just bounced.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Why are Nazi's shooting at a little kid? That just doesn't make any sense. I guess you really don't have to be much of a superhero when your arch nemesis is Dr. Narsty, and the best he can do is fire a cork into your mouth that a bunch of kids can pull out.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>I guess the original Captain Tootsie was a cowboy, but he didn't work out so they fired him. I'm not touching the strip on R.C. and the Adventures of \"Quickie\" if you know what I mean.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Become an Artist</h2><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>\"Learn to draw like us, even though we're not good enough to get our art into this comic unless we pay for an ad.\"</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Yeah, I remember in school the guys who could draw well got all the girls. So did the guys in drama and chess club.</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Buy This Comic!</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>I think I see why Daredevil Comics failed. Look at the character names: Nightro? Dash Dillon? Pat Patriot? Tr\u00e9s original. I wish I had gotten a hold on some of those Mary Marvel glow pictures though. Yummy!</p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Glow in the dark Kryptonite rocks? It's terrific! It's fantastic! It's Kryptonastic!</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>And here's my second favorite part--when you wear it too long, it turns your finger green.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>I love how they draw you in with the plight of the poor, homeless superhero, then throw the Frazetta naked chick art at you.  Why is Wonder Woman the biggest doll? Not that I'm complaining, but are they trying to tell me something? I can't make fun of the Titans though, that was one of the best teams of all time.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Here's another great, the Muhammed Ali vs. Superman fight. Hey, isn't that Cassius Clay? Underoos are actually the biggest kid rip-off ever. I mean, think about it. You get these really cool superhero uniforms, but you have to wear them under your clothes. Every body stares at you if you wear them on the outside of your clothes, at least they did me.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>What is FOOM! I guess they had to make it \"Friends Of Ol' Marvel,\" because if it were \"Friends Of Marvel\" the acronym would have been FOM, and that's just stupid. FOOM is much better. Now I know why I haven't seen Mockingbird in years. Hawkeye killed her making one of these stupid ads.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>\"Life has no meaning without my latest Marvels.\" Get a life Spidey!</p><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Go, Go Gadget Gizmo!</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Way to promote a healthly lifestyle to the kiddies there, Mr. Bar-B-Q whatever-your-name-is.</p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>\"Flying saucers are real!\"  Wow! Call the CIA, call MI6, call ANYBODY! Aliens are here and they're driving frisbees!  And if someone could explain the scientific principle of differential expansion, please send your answers (and refund requests) to Trek Space Ships (wow, do you think they were jumping on a particular band wagon or what?)</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>It's those x-ray specs again.  They can guarantee me fun but not genuine x-ray vision?  Pah! That's just not good enough!  I'd say the only thing that will end up \"blushingly funny\" is me when I wander into the party wearing those thick-rimmed spectacles.</p> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Lots of Toys for Boys and Girls</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>GoBots!  The-almost-but-not-quite-Transformers.  Build your very own transforming car / space ship / aeroplane.  If only Tonka had had the marketing capabilities of Hasbro, it would be a GoBots movie craze instead of the Transformers.</p> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><p>SILLY PUTTY!  That's all I've got to say on the matter.</p> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Oh those were the days... life was good, spirits were high and skates had two and two.  None of your \"in-line\" business.  Oh no, we were real kids back when I were a lass, with our stablisers and cabbage-patch dolls.  Funny thing is, I think my very first pair of skates really were strap on Winchesters, and they were old fashioned even back then.</p><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Deal or No Deal?</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><p>Entrepreneurial spirit starts here folks.  First you get your bike, then you get your paper round, then the whole world is your oyster!  Alternatively, you could invest your allowance in stamps, the hobby of small kids and anoraks everywhere.  Most of us grew out of it but there's still those few, lurking in the background, who geek-out at just the thought of a penny black.</p> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Heath, Hygiene, and Safety</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Huckster Heroes</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Make Your First Dollar</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Ninjas Rule</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>The Monster Mash</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Sports Stars</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Oh No, OJ!</h2> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Before There Was MTV</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><p>Oh David, how the gorgeous have aged! Once a pin-up, now Ducky.  This just calls for an NCIS quote (do excuse me): (Todd) \"Gibbs, what did Ducky look like when he was younger?\"  (Gibbs) \"Illya Kuryakin.\"</p><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Too Good to Be True</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>War Propaganda</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Fashion Sense or Fashion Dense?</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Sex Sells</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>What Were They Thinking</h2> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br /><p><br /><a> </a></p><h2>Meatloaf; Humongous Rock Star of the Universe<br /></h2>\n<br /><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"461970\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25785/461970-meatloaf2_super.jpg\" title=\"Close up of the mail-away form.\"><img id=\"461970\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25785/461970-meatloaf2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Close up of the mail-away form.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Close up of the mail-away form.</div></div></div></div><br /><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"461969\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25785/461969-meatloaf1_super.jpg\" title=\"Just what is going on here?\"><img id=\"461969\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25785/461969-meatloaf1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Just what is going on here?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Just what is going on here?</div></div></div></div>Here's an ad which can be found throughout many 1980's Marvel back issues. Essentially, it features rock musician Meatloaf calling out in desperation to aid the children of the Special Olympics. Note the tears streaming down his face in the first panel. The advertisement appears to start out with Meatloaf performing at a concert, on a stage in front of a crowd, but he becomes distracted from his show and shouts out \"But who's gonna help me?\" rather than this confusing the audience (because his first lines were in a thought bubble and thereby the audience would not have understood what he needed help with), his audience is replaced altogether by a random grab back of assorted Marvel characters plus a few random children.<br />Meatloaf then informs us that the way we can help is by filling out a form for a cassette or record for the official theme song to the 1987 Special Olympics.<br />Panel to panel the conversation has little logical flow, and the end conclusion doesn't seem like it warranted Meatloaf getting as upset as he did. He was putting on a concert, isn't that the perfect time to say \"hey I just did a song to help out the Special Olympics, go out and pick it up!\"? Instead he gives up on his audience and enlists the help of Marvel super-heroes (and children). Whatever works for ya, Meat.<br />And by the final panel, in contrast to the first where tears are streaming down his face, Meatloaf looks totally jazzed! It's like his anguish was all an act and he was really waiting to tell us to fill out the form all along. Faker.<br />This ad is so nonsensical and random that it's charming. Hail Meatloaf, Humongous Rock Star of the Universe. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Vulto (From Mars)<br /></h2>Vulto was a superhero from <a href=\"/mars/34-55781/\"> Mars</a> with magnetic powers.&nbsp; Each issue that he appeared&nbsp; in <a href=\"/nedor/57-2260/\">  Nedor Comics</a>, Vulto would be a regular comic superhero story until the end when he announces he recharges his power by eating Grape Nut Flakes.&nbsp; The last panal would have a boy holding up a plain looking cereal box of Grape Nuts and tell you that you may not get magnetic powers but it will give you a Dynamo Drive.",

        "description":"<h2>Types of Sigils</h2> <p>In the CrossGen imprint of comics, Sigil-bearers are the central focus of most of the individual titles, and figure largely into the overall structure of the CrossGen universe, otherwise known as the Sigilverse.</p> <p>There are essentially three types of Sigil-bearers, and two of these groups can be further broken down into smaller groups. All <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sigil/18-41551/\">   Sigils</a> are marks given to individuals by beings who have undergone a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/transition/12-43082/\">   Transition</a>, or ascenion to become god-like beings. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/solusandra/29-42974/\">   Solusandra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danik/29-42966/\">   Danik</a> are tranisioned Atlanteans from Earth's ancient past (over 100,000 years in the past). All of Solusandra's Sigil-bearers are human, while most of Danik's are un-ascended Atlanteans with the remaining two being human. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charon/29-13218/\">   Charon</a>, the evil god of the Negation universe, learns how to give a similar symbol, called a Ligis, to non-human creatures with the aid of the Sigil-bearer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/javi/29-13208/\">   Javi</a>.</p><a> </a> <h2>Solusandra's Sigil-bearers</h2> The original Sigil-bearers possess a yellow and red colored symbol which very much resembles a Yin-Yang symbol. This Sigil was is the symbol of Solusandra, and is bestowed by her in a seemingly random nature although it is later discovered that she was actually very deliberate in her choosing, if not always wise. Each of these Sigil-bearers have an appointed Mentor, who is actually a splinter aspect of Danik. When Solusandra was cast down following confrontations with her Atlantean peers and Charon of the Negation, Danik took it upon himself to watch over and train her Bearers for the the coming war. <p>Humans granted this symbol are advanced up their personal evolutionary scale as far as possible. This change, though prompted by the Sigil, is genetic and permanent. Even if the Sigil is lost or removed by Solusandra, the Bearers powers are not lost, though they might initially believe so. Over time, the Bearers will regain their powers, and in fact most likely experience a power increase because of their need to relearn the power's use.</p> <p>There are likely more Sigil-bearers existing on worlds across the universe than is known. The following is a listing and summary of the know Sigil-bearers of Solusandra.</p><p><a> </a></p> <h3>The Original Five</h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/samandahl-rey/29-13261/\">Samandahl Rey</a> of Gaia: One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and the most important in Danik's plans for the future. Sam's Sigil gave him molecular control over inanimate matter. Sam's Sigil is located on his chest, and looks very much like a burn. Through the Sigil's use, Sam becomes the leader of humanity's fight against the Saurian race (which only sees humans as food to be eaten). Samandahl Rey sires a child with Capricia of Atlantis.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sephie/29-13193/\">Sephie</a> of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/meridian/34-42971/\">   Meridian</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demetria/34-42973/\">   Demetria</a>: One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and potentially one of the most powerful. Sephie's Sigil grants her defensive shielding, repair of organic and inorganic matter, healing of organic matter, flight, and a myriad other abilities. Through the Sigil's use, Sephie begins a crusade against her uncle Ilahn, a cruel despot bent on world (if not universal) domination. Sephie's Sigil is located on her forehead.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ilahn/29-42988/\">Ilahn</a> of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cadador/34-42972/\">   Cadador</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demetria/34-42973/\">   Demetria</a>: One of the original five Sigil-bearers, and one of the most ruthless. Ilahn's abilities included disintegration of matter, energy blasts, self-healing and teleportation. Ilahn is also the first to learn that Sigil bearers can drain the powers/life-forces of the First. Through the Sigil's use, Ilahn strives to solidify his power over the planet, and rid himself of his niece Sephie once and for all. Ilahn's Sigil is located at his throat.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/giselle-villard/29-13291/\">Giselle Villard</a> of Ciress: One of the original five Sigil-bearers. Giselle's Sigil allowed her to possess all of the spirits of the great masters of her world, and allowed her to perform high-order magic without preparation, material elements, or spells. Through the use of her Sigil, Giselle successfully defends her planet from Animora, an evil First who wishes Ciress as her personal plaything. When Solusandra returned to Giselle to take the Sigil back, Giselle was able to put up fantastic resistance against the goddess, but ultimately failing. Giselle's Sigil is located on her right palm.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ethan/29-41544/\">Ethan</a> of the Heron Dynasty on Avalon: One of the original five Sigil-bearers. Ethan's Sigil grants him the use of a sword of light, as well as multiple defensive abilities and fighting skills, and the ability to heal himself (and later others). Through the Sigil's use, Ethan defends the Herons Dynasty from those in the Raven Dynasty who would see it destroyed, and also successfully creates a free homeland for the Lesser Races. Ethan's Sigil is located on his right bicep.<br /> <br /><h3>Additional Bearers</h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brath-mac-garen/29-13194/\">Brath Mac Garen</a> of Han-Jinn: Brath is a clan leader among the strongest Urelanders clans. He works to unite the myriad clans to better repel invades to their homeland. Brath's Sigil grants him multiple abilities, including personal healing, language translation, and confidence building. Through the use of the Sigil, Brath unites his clans, but is ultimately is captured by the enemy when Solusandra returns to take her Sigil back. Brath's Sigil is located on his chest.<br /><br /><a href=\"/sara-janning/29-43085/\">Sara Janning</a> of Yamivol Prime: Sara Janning is an ice miner on the planet Yamivol Prime, far out on the frontier of the Chimera Empire. Sara is in hiding from the Emperor and his family, a dynasty which brought themselves to power through genetic manipulation of their line. Chimera's Emperors have mandated periodic genetic scanning of every inhabitant in a search for genes they can use to take the next step in their family's evolution. Sara has evaded capture since the day she saw her family killed by Chimera forces right before her eyes. That was also the day she was granted her Sigil. Sara's Sigil powers are somewhat esoteric, and don't really manifest themselves until she is fighting for her life against the Emperor who discovers her true nature. Sara's Sigil is located on the small of her back.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mordath/29-13182/\">Mordath</a> of Quin: Mordath is an undead human, and the despot conqueror of the Five Lands of Quin. Three-hundred years before when he first tried to conquer the Five Lands, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/altwaal/29-42951/\">   Altwaal</a> appeared out of nowhere to end the battle by shooting Mordath through the chest with an explosive arrow. [See: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/altwaals-weapons/18-43023/\">Altwaal's Weapons</a>] Three centuries later, he is resurrected (but not given full life, only reanimation of an emaciated body) and given a Sigil of power, which he uses to destroy that who stood against him and enslave the remainder of the Five Land's inhabitants. Mordath is likely the most evil and ruthless, and used his Sigil powers nearly exclusively for destruction. Curiously, Modath's Sigil never healed his undead body, and possibly because of his character he never thought to turn his powers inward and attempt such a feat. Mordath's Sigil is located on the top of his head, and is the largest Sigil among all the bearers.<br /><br />Lindy Karsten (AKA <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/radiant/29-53850/\">   Radiant</a>) of Heliotrope: Lindy is a designer of high-end MMORPGs for her world. As Radiant, Lindy is the undisputed champion of her world's most popular game (a planet on which it seems EVERYONE plays). Lindy is the first Sigil-bearer to have her mark taken away by its creator, Solusandra. Lindy's Sigil seems to grant her heightened speed and reflexes, giving her a decided edge in the game world. The original location of Lindy's Sigil is unknown, as she always wore a neck to toe gaming suit. However, her suit does have an all-golden version of the Sigil in multiple places.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/todosi/29-13202/\">Todosi</a> of Han-Jinn: Todosi was a great warrior of his people, the defender of their homeland. When he was granted the Sigil by who he thought was a goddess, he knew he had been touched by destiny. He knew that he had been marked, and that his mark prophesied the fate of his people, but did that fate include victory. Todosi was continually successful in defending his people, until the day the gods appeared. As an \"experiment\" to see if a Sigil-bearer could be killed, one of the First used the Rod of Altwaal [See: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/altwaals-weapons/18-43023/\">Altwaal's Weapons</a>&nbsp;] against Todosi, successfully killing him. When Todosi died, his Sigil moved to his brother, who then vowed to kill every god in heaven in revenge. Todosi's Sigil was located on the middle of his back.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/obo-san/29-13196/\">Obo-san</a>&nbsp;(AKA Nobuyuki Tsugawa) of Han-Jinn: Obo-san was a devout monk and eschewed all forms of violence. However, he knew that the homeland must be protected, so he lent his wisdom to his brother Todosi, and to the Emperor. When Todosi died at the hands of a god, Obo-san inherited his brother's Sigil, and also came in possession of the very weapon that caused the murder, a weapon he dubbed \"The Weapon of Heaven.\" Obo-san became his homeland's protector in his brother's stead, rejecting his non-violent past, and rejecting the worship of the god as well. He vowed to kill every god in heaven as revenge for the callous murder of his brother. Obo-san Sigil grants him the ability to influence and control other humans with the very words he speaks. Obo-san's Sigil is located on his back, just as it had been on his brother.<br /><br />Lord Birrema of Courabo: Birrema is the beloved ruler of the world Courabo, a war torn world which is now living in peace because of the efforts of his efforts. Biremma is the first Sigil-bearer approached by Ilahn of Cadador for help against Sephie. Biremma, who is at first distrustful of Ilahn and wants nothing to do with him, is soon swayed when Ilahn promises aid for Courabo's people. When Biremma and Ilahn shake hands on the deal, either they sympathetic telepathy shared between Sigil-bearers does not work, or Ilahn is somehow able to deceive Biremma, or Biremma overlooks Ilahn's nature for the good of his people. Biremma ultimately allows Sephie to defeat him once he learns the real truth of her character. Biremma's Sigil grants him the power to fly, increased fighting prowess, and the ability to create armor, a shield, and a sword, all made of hard light.<br /><br />Taylor (AKA <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-man/29-53844/\">   Mighty Man</a>): Taylor's world is one of the first planets to suffer a full scale invasion by Charon and his Negation forces. Taylor has used his Sigil power to assume the role of superhero protector of his planet. Taylor, which is Mighty Man's secret identity, works as a reporter at a major newspaper in a very large city. When the Negation arrives, they attack without warning, vaporizing and entire section of the cities inhabitants with their first strike, leaving only Mighty Man as a survivor. Taylor confronts Evinlea of the First, who is now fighting for Charon. He is quickly defeated, and is questioned by Charon, who is searching for Taylor's mentor, and aspect of Danik. Once they have the information needed, Evinlea blows Mighty Man's head off with a blast of power. As an obvious \"clone\" of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">   Superman</a>, Mighty Man possesses the same types of powers, but his levels are unknown. Taylor's Sigil was located just below his throat.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kellra-tuskin/29-58526/\">Kellra Tuskin</a> of Cardeen: Kellra is Cardeen's leading prognosticator and family/relationship counselor. Kellra is able to see into the future using her Sigil's powers, specifically looking into the coming history of individuals and thereby give them advice to change that future for the better. When Kellra is confronted by Solusandra, she refuses to relinquish her Sigil, and somehow uses her knowledge against the goddess. Kellra is thought to already been highly trained in her vocation well before she gained her Sigil, and that is what guided her ultimate manifestations of powers. Kellra is successful in driving Solusandra mad, making her see visions that cause her to loose all self-control. Solusandra leaves Cardeen without taking back her Sigil.<br /><br />Neine of the blue-skinned feralfolk: Neine is one of the four Sigil-bearers from various worlds who are co-opted into helping Ilahn of Cadador fight against Sephie. Neine had once served as an agent for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ingra/29-13246/\">   Ingra</a> of the First, fighting at her side at some time in his past. Neine's Sigil seems to grant him increased fighting ability, speed, reflexes, and flexibility as well was flight. Neine is ultimately defeated by Sephie.<br /><br /><a href=\"/mikos/29-54041/\">Mikos</a> of Abyelos: Mikos is a young boy (teenager) who believes his Sigil powers had been given to him as a gift from a deity. At first, Mikos uses his powers to perform simple \"magic\" tricks to impress children, but he soon learned to harness his powers in increasingly growing measure. Soon, the people of Abyelos begin to swamp the boy, begging him to perform miracles in their lives. Eventually Mikos has all he can stand, and he commands them all to stop, which they all do because his emotional outburst causes his power to flare, turning every inhabitant on the planet to statues of crystal. When Solusandra arrives to take away his Sigil, Lindy Karsten convinces her to give him a short amount of time to solve the problem, which he does at just the last moment. Solusandra then takes her Sigil and departs. Mikos's Sigil grants him matter conversion powers, telekinesis, and matter-energy conversion powers. Mikos cries A LOT and possesses a high-level of chemistry and biological knowledge. Mikos's Sigil was located on his forehead, which he always hid with a funky looking piece of *Liefeld-esque* headgear.<br /><br />Johnny Jumpjet of the Helix Worlds: Not much is known about the hero of the Helix Worlds, Johnny Jumpjet. He is a short, fat, bald guy who wears a rocket-equipped space suit complete with pressurized helmet, even in the perfectly breathable atmosphere a habitable planet. Johnny's Sigil-based powers are unknown. Johnny was one of the first Sigil-bearers recruited by Samandahl Rey for the fight against the Negation. Johnny was last seen about to get his butt kicked by Mordath for asking a stupid question. Johnny's Sigil is located on the left side of his bald head.<br /><br />Columella the iron goddess: Columella is one of the four Sigil bearers recruited by Ilahn for his fight against Sephie. Columella is known as the iron goddess on her homeworld, but where that is and what her story entails is unknown. She is a savage fighter, and thinks more highly of herself than she really should, since she is easily defeated by Sephie, a girl half her age. Columella apparently worked at sometime in the past for Ingra of the First. Columella's Sigil grants her flight, advanced battle prowess, and other unknown abilities.<br /><br />Grenang the blacksmith: Grenang is one of the four Sigil-bearers recruited by Ilahn for his fight against Sephie of Meridian. Not much is known about Grenang or his background, other than he is a blacksmith, and holds clan \"etiquette\" in high regard. He comes close to dealing Sephie a mortal blow, and is then disintegrated by Ilahn in anger. Grenang's Sigil granted him the power of flight, blast powers, and other unknown abilities.<br /><br />Turos of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/meridian/34-42971/\">   Meridian</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demetria/34-42973/\">   Demetria</a>: Turos was once the Minister of Meridian, father to Sephie, and brother to Ilahn. He is notable as the shortest lived Sigil-bearer on record, dying only minutes after receiving the mark. Unknown to all, Ilahn had been poisoning his brother, so the stress of the Sigil's empowerment was too much for his weakened constitution to bear. He died, passing the Sigil onto his daughter, Sephie.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/javi/29-13208/\">Javi</a> of Larringa: Javi was a doctor on Larringa who used his Sigil's power to heal. Javi was abducted by Negation agents into the Dark Universe. There he learned he was better able to still access his abilities than any other Sigil-bearer, and also learned he could boost the power of other Sigil-bearers, or members of The First, around him. He is recruited by Evinlea of the First, and is eventually presumed killed at the hands of Negation forces. Buried and left to rot, his Sigil actually keeps him alive and slowly heals his body. He is unearthed by Charon, and pressed into the evil god's service. Being a highly religious man, Javi (after working to destroy him) comes to believe that Charon is the true god and dedicates his life to the mad deity's service. Javi is killed again in a confrontation with Obregon Kaine's resistance group. Javi's Sigil was located on his right forearm.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mercer-drake/29-13213/\">Mercer Drake</a> of the Karzath System: Mercer's power is to overcome any physical obstacle to attain a location or object. Back in the Karzath System, Mercer was a pirate and profiteer, using his Sigil abilities for personal gain. Mercer is one of a group of Sigil-bearers who are abducted into the Negation universe and placed under observation on a prison planet. At first, Mercer joins Obregon Kaine's resistance, but eventually departs to essentially find a planet to hide on away from Charon and his minions. Mercer's Sigil is located on his chest.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/westin/29-13214/\">&nbsp;Westin</a>: Westin has the ability to see how technology is operated, and uses it to help his fellow captives of the Negation escape from Komptin on his prison planet. Later it is revealed that he actually sees backwards in time when he comes in contact with a device. When this happens, he is able to see how the technology was operated before, and then emulates what he sees, sometimes with less than desirable results. At first a member of Obregon Kaine's resistance, he follows Mercer away from the battle.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shassa/29-13206/\">Shassa</a>: Shassa's powers enable her to combat any enemy by feeding off portions of their strengths, though it only affects her and does not seem to weaken her opponents in any way. Shassa rarely wins any of her confrontations, leading many to believe she does not truly understand how her powers operate and is too obstinate to ask for aid or training. A member of Obregon Kaine's resistance, she eventually leaves the to follow Mercer's splinter group, ostensibly to \"protect\" those without a Sigil.<br /> <p>Rika the All-Seeing of the Eternal Empire: Not much is known about Rika other than the fact she was tricked into aiding Ingra of the First.<br /></p> <p>Riaglal of Forest: Nearly nothing at all is known of Riaglal but for a name.</p> <p>Unknown Sigil-bearers: Various Sigil-bearers seen throughout the Sigilverse. Most of these Sigil-bearers were recruited by Samandahl Rey by order of Danik to join the fight against Charon and his Negation. The furry, blue-skinned fellow was among those captured by the Negation and taken to their prison planet. He is killed during an escape attempt, proving that Sigil-bearers can be killed, though it is extremely hard to accomplish.</p><h2>Danik's Sigil-Bearers</h2> Danik's Sigil is a glowing, all-orange symbol, oval in general shape with two arms (imitating a spiral galaxy). Danik first granted his Sigil to his best friend from 100,000 years before in Atlantis, Capricia. In turn, he ordered her to choose five more companions to aid her in a sudden battle against monsters from the Negation universe. Atlanteans, having already ascended up the evolutionary scale, already possess a myriad of powers, depending upon what Discipline they chose earlier in their life. Danik's Sigil seems to offer advanced protection and lends focus to the powers they already possess as Atlanteans. <p>In the case of the two humans, Danik's Sigil does not seem to offer evolutionary advancement as Solusandra's does. Here the Sigils allow for increased acuteness for mental and sensory abilities the owner already possesses.<br /><br /></p><p><a> </a></p> <h3>Atlantean Bearers</h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/capricia/29-13224/\">Capricia</a> of Atlantis: The first of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and another of the most important in his plans. Capricia is an empath, and exhibits shape-changing abilities. Capricia was a student of the Empathy Discipline in Atlantis. Capricia bears the child of Samandahl Rey. Capricia's Sigil rests atop her left breast.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galvan/29-13226/\">Galvan</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and twin brother to Gammid. Galvan's abilities allow him to control the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Galvan was a student of the Passion Discipline in Atlantis. Galvan's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gammid/29-13219/\">Gammid</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and twin brother to Galvan. Galvan's abilities allow him to control the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Gammid was a student of the Passion Discipline in Atlantis. Gammid's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tug/29-13228/\">Tug</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers. Tug's abilities rest in his mind, allowing him both sharp telepathy and powerful telekinesis. Tug was a student of the Mind Discipline in Atlantis. Tug's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/verityn/29-13225/\">Verityn</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers, and the youngest. Verityn's abilities allow him to act as a seer, seeing into both the past and the future. He is also a powerful telepath, and can observe the flow of energy in space and time. Verityn was a student of the Spirit Discipline in Atlantis. Verityn's Sigil rests atop his left breast.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zephyre/29-13227/\">Zephyre</a> of Atlantis: One of the first six of Danik's Sigil-bearers. Zephyre's abilities allow her to move with incredible speed. Zephyre as a student of the Body Discipline in Atlantis. Zephyre's Sigil rests atop her left breast.<br /><br /><p><a> </a></p> <h3>Human Bearers</h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cassie-starkweather/29-12373/\">Cassie Starkweather</a> of Erebus: Cassie's Sigil grants her the ability to \"see\" ghosts, and otherwise speak to the dead and to supernatural creatures.<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/simon-archard/29-53704/\">Simon Archard</a> of Arcadia: Archard is a detective and master sleuth. He has eidetic memory and is close to emotionless, remaining utterly calm in situations of crisis. He also remains emotionally distant from other people. Simon carries his Sigil on the end of his cane, which never leaves his hand.<br /><br /><p><a> </a></p> <h2>Charon's Ligis-Bearers</h2> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charon/29-13218/\">   Charon</a>, evil god of the Negation universe, is an ascended human from planet Earth. Tens of thousands of years following the Atlanteans, he and a work associate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/appolyon/29-43025/\">   Appolyon</a> ascended, they were ripped into the Negation universe. At first, Charon was temporarily insane, but was nursed back to mental health by Appolyon. In addition, Charon divested himself of his \"bad\" emotions and desires. These in turn became corporeal and self-aware beings of great power, his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lawbringers/65-53136/\">   Lawbringers</a>. <p>Charon saw the universe he had entered, and found it in \"chaos.\" The laws of physics worked differently some places than they had in his universe, and might even be subject to change. Using his Lawbringers and the remaining humans who had survived being ripped off the Earth as an army, he embarked on a crusade bring order to the chaos of this universe. He was opposed by Appolyon, but possessing slightly greater power, banished his enemy to a hellish sub-dimension. Charon then set himself up as Emperor of the Negation universe.</p> <p>Ten thousand years later, resistance to Charon's Negation forces is virtually nil, and he turns his eye back out of his universe to the one from which he came. After a short and explosive meeting with Solusandra, Charon has dimensional portals between the universes contructed, and begins slowly infiltrating the Bright universe. Charon gains intelligence on the First and the Sigil-bearers, eventually abducting representatives of each for further study. He begins attempting to graft his own version of the Sigil on his own universe's natural inhabitants, all of which are non-humans. The result are grotesque and disastrous, resulting in horrible deaths for every creature experimented upon. Charon decides to attempt grafting human DNA into his subjects, but the result is even more horrible than previous experiments. When Javi Cobian is dug out of his grave, Charon convinces him to use his powers to heal the grafting subjects long enough for them to live and receive Charon's Ligis. Below are listed the first four, and thus far only known <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ligis-bearer/65-53722/\">   Ligis-bearers</a>.</p><br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shrakti/29-53721/\">Shrakti</a> of the Negation: Shrakti's abilities include spatial and dimensional teleportation. Her ultimate limits are unknown.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tibian/29-53724/\">Tibian</a> of the Negation: Tibian's abilities allow him to fight with unbridled fury. He is able to both sustain and cause massive amounts of damage.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trocantor/29-53723/\">Trocantor</a> of the Negation: Trocantor is a telepath of the highest order. Only the mind of his god, Charon, has proven to be beyond his comprehension.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brevus/29-53725/\">Brevus</a> of the Negation: Brevus possesses near unlimited strength. The upper limits of his strength is unknown.</li></ul><p><a> </a></p> <h2>Note on CrossGen Comics</h2> <p>Soon after the Negation War had begun, CrossGen Comics suffered bankruptcy and ceased publication of all volumes. Many of the Sigil-bearer's stories remain unfinished, and in some cases are quite confusing when comparing the stories in individual publications to the beginning storyline of the Negation War. (For example, Mordath is thought killed by Arwyn in an unofficial script released by Sojourn's writer, but he is seen being recruited by Samandahl Rey at the beginning of the Negation War.) The final outcome of the Sigil-bearers and their war against Charon and his Negation remains unknown.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Women in the Golden Age of Comics</h2><p><a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">The Golden Age</a> was the time from 1930s to the 1940s and where women developed their role in comics, which would impact later women roles in comics. This time was truly golden for the comics as they had evolved from comic strips though during this era, women in comics weren\u2019t really people with super abilities. These girls\u2019 powers were successful careers, girls who were involved in romance stories or perky teenagers who were dreaming of guys. Comics during this time were developing themes, such as the lone woman taking care of children and filling in her husband\u2019s jobs (think World War II).</p><p>Comics were also discovering new genres, like romance, action, mystery and crime, humor and teen-themed. The diversity was dwindling during the 50s because new mediums of entertainment were being invented. For example, the radio was very popular as radio was a free way of getting their daily dose of fiction. The fact the Dr. Fredric Wertham\u2019s book Seduction of the Innocents was released had accused comics for being responsible for the anti-social behavior. In reaction to that, the Comics Code was imposed, and thus began the dwindling of sales regarding comics. However, there were three types of characters for women in comics and they were:</p><h3><b>Career Orientated Girls</b></h3><p>With the use of women in comics during the Golden Age, the career-type character were usually females looking for work, but not work that women usually did during World War I. Instead of making weapons for the war effort, they would be portrayed as looking for work as a secretary, nurse or sometimes a teacher. Such characters were Millie the Model and Nellie the Nurse. Women looking for work as a secretary etc. was quite a big thing, as being employed was one thing, being paid the same rate as men was another.</p><h3>Romantic Role</h3><p>The second role, which was the romance archetype, had two roles. They could either be the Bad or Good Girl.</p><ul><li>The Good Girl would usually have their heart broken or end up in a true romantic relationship.</li><li>The Bad Girl always broke the boys\u2019 hearts.</li></ul><p>Plots involved with these characters could either that the Good Girl finds true love and gets married while the Bad Girl tries to be good, but fails and goes back to her wild ways.</p><h3>Perky Teenager Role</h3><p>The perky teenager roles were taken by characters such as <a href=\"/betty/49-11037/\">Betty</a> and <a href=\"/veronica-lodge/29-2843/\">Veronica</a> from the <a href=\"/archie-comics/49-1898/\">Archie comics</a>. They could be fun-loving and crazy teenagers (and sometimes stupid) as both of them spent all their time fighting over Archie. <a href=\"/josie/49-11906/\">Josie</a> from <a href=\"/josie-and-the-pussycats/65-56774/\">Josie and the Pussycats</a> was also like this, involving her bands in strange adventures but always making it through.</p><h2>Women as Superheroes in Comics</h2><p>The first known female superhero was a minor character called <a href=\"/fantomah/29-2627/\">Fantomah</a> by writer/artist <a href=\"/fletcher-hanks/26-56582/\">Fletcher Hanks</a>. Fantomah was an immortal Egyptian woman who could turn into a skull-faced creature with superpowers who would fight evil. Her first appearance was in Fiction House\u2019s <i><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jungle-comics-/37-126016/\">Jungle Comics</a></i> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jungle-comics-/37-126016/\">#2</a> which was released in February 1940. Another character who was highly influential was <a href=\"/invisible-scarlet-oneil/29-61051/\">Invisible Scarlet O'Neil</a> who fought crime using the power of invisibility and debuted on June 3, 1940 in a newspaper comic strip. Antiheroes were also used, as <a href=\"/black-widow/29-9559/\">Black Widow</a> (not to be confused with <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Marvel\u2019s Black Widow</a>) who was an emissary of <a href=\"/satan/29-21893/\">Satan</a> and killed criminals and sent them back to Hell. A popular female superhero was <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> who was created by <a href=\"/william-moulton-marston/26-43411/\">William Moulton Marston</a> and his wife <a href=\"/elizabeth-holloway-marston/26-55785/\">Elizabeth</a> and she debuted in <i><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/all-star-comics-/37-116412/\">All Star Comics #8</a></i>. He created Wonder Woman because he wanted a positive role model for girls around the world as he wrote in an article about comic books:</p><blockquote><p>\"America's woman of tomorrow should be made the hero of a new type of comic strip. By this, I mean a character with all the allure of an attractive woman, but with the strength also of a powerful man. There isn't enough love in the male organism to run this planet peacefully. What women presently lack is the dominance or self-assertive power to put over and enforce her love diaries. I have given Wonder Woman this dominant force, but kept her loving. It is my hope to make this strip as appealing to adults as it has proved to kids.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Marston was the writer for the first Wonder Woman comics, and he had written her as a woman with natural leadership skills, though he had always portrayed them with the themes of bondage. In one issue, she went mad because her bracelets had been broken, and the bracelets represented restraint and said that \u201cpower without self-control tears a girl to pieces.\u201d</p><p>The World War II theme was fading away and publishers wanted to appeal to a wider variety of audiences. Since Wonder Woman, there would be <a href=\"/miss-america/29-31887/\">Miss America</a>, <a href=\"/sun-girl/29-36454/\">Sun Girl</a>, <a href=\"/blonde-phantom/29-41880/\">Blonde Phantom</a>, the revival of <a href=\"/phantom-lady/29-11239/\">Phantom Lady</a> and <a href=\"/black-canary/29-1689/\">Black Canary</a>. Female characters in comics then started wearing costumes such as the <a href=\"/woman-in-red/29-6231/\">Woman in Red</a>, who was a police officer and the <a href=\"/phantom-lady/29-11239/\">Phantom Lady</a>, who wore a green (and then red) cape. During World War II, women had to take up jobs that were usually taken up by men, such as arms making, truck driving and welders. The reason why women were employed to take up these jobs was because of the war effort. Women wouldn\u2019t have originally been able to take up these jobs. Once the men returned home from war, the women refused to give up this, as they felt having a job was liberating and this created very vague definitions of masculinity and femininity. This new type of role in women created the 'femme fatale', who was a sexually aggressive woman. One such example is a comic character called The Spirit. She was someone who always wanted to avenge herself by the means of blackmail.</p><h2>Women in the Silver Age of Comics</h2><p><a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">The Silver Age</a>\u2019s time frames were the 60s and the 70s and a popular comic genre was romance comics. During this time, were published that if you liked one, you would stick to it. If you wanted a classic 40s feel of superheroes, you were with DC, and if you wanted fast-paced action, you were with Marvel. There were still comics being published this time that could have been published to target girls and women, but few of them were being published by women. The beginning of the 60s would be a renewal of the target audience for comics, as DC had started the ball rolling but would be later known as the Marvel Revolution in 1961 where comics were published specifically for teenage boys.</p><h3>DC Comics</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"87040\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/981/87040-107139-lois-lane_super.jpg\" title=\"Its about time...\"><img id=\"87040\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/981/87040-107139-lois-lane_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Its about time...\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Its about time...</div></div></div></div><p>After the Comic Code, DC had its own code about women in comics. Here is an example of what was stated: \u201cThe inclusion of females in stories is specifically discouraged. Women, when used in plot structure, should be secondary in importance, and should be drawn realistically, without exaggeration of feminine physical qualities.\u201d</p><p>During the Silver Age, women always had some kind of connection with the hero\u2019s alter ego. For example, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lois-lane/29-1808/\">Lois Lane</a> worked with Clark Kent (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>). Carol Ferris (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-sapphire/29-5698/\">Star Sapphire</a>) was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern/12-41148/\">Green Lantern</a>\u2019s boss and<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iris-west/29-46069/\">Iris West</a> was the on-off girlfriend of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>\u2019s alter ego, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Barry Allen</a>. Even when Wonder Woman was starting out she wasn't very popular at first during her comics but when she became an animated character she wasn't taken very seriously. In the Super Friends her main job was to use the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-womans-invisible-plane/18-43539/\">Invisible Jet</a> to take the men to their destinations.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"175140\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/175140-177957-lois-lane_super.jpg\" title=\"to change the roles!\"><img id=\"175140\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/175140-177957-lois-lane_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"to change the roles!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">to change the roles!</div></div></div></div><p>In the 1950s, Batman\u2019s character family would expand. That would be the popular beginnings for such characters like <a href=\"/ace-the-bat-hound/29-31302/\">Ace The Bat-Hound</a>, but two female characters would join: <a href=\"/vicki-vale/29-8264/\">Vicki Vale</a>, who was basically <a href=\"/lois-lane/29-1808/\">Lois Lane</a> and <a href=\"/batwoman/29-9052/\">Batwoman</a>. She burst onto the scene during the 50s also known as <a href=\"/batgirl/29-1701/\">Kathy Kane</a> and the first response she gets from a male bad guy is \u201cHa-ha! What can she do?\u201d Another super heroine called the <a href=\"/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a> was someone on a motorbike, and there also many lines of what feminists would call sexist.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\"><blockquote><p>Burglar: \"There\u2019s only two of them. The girl doesn\u2019t count.\u201d</p><p>Robin: \"A girl saving you? It\u2019s ridiculous!\u201d</p><p>Batman: \"This is no place for a girl.\u201d</p><p>Batwoman: \"How could any woman ever equal the great Batman?\u201d</p></blockquote></div><p>Another prominent female character was <a href=\"/carol-ferris/29-18276/\">Carol Ferris</a> who played <a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a>\u2019s (Green Lantern) boss. This was quite different, as the woman was in charge of the man. Hal Jordan tried many times to date her, but she rejected his advances and she always thought of business first as quoted here from Showcase #22 in 1959.</p><p>\"You heard what dad said. I've got to satisfy his faith in me - and that means that during the next two years, I'll have absolutely no time for romance! I'm your boss Hal Jordan and that's orders.\"</p><p>Ferris was also a superheroine and took up the role of Star Sapphire to fight Green Lantern. A strategy she planned was to weaken Green Lantern so much that she would then propose to him. Star Sapphire unmakes Green Lantern, and he promises to marry her. With his ring, he reads her mind and realizes that she is Carol Fenris. He then erases her mind so that he can put off the marriage.</p><h3>Marvel Comics</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"510998\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07_super.jpg\" title=\"Marvel's First: Invisible Girl\"><img id=\"510998\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/510998-invisiblewoman07_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Marvel's First: Invisible Girl\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Marvel's First: Invisible Girl</div></div></div></div><p>When Atlas Comics became Marvel Comics, the use of women in comics were more common and one of the first ones to be used was the Susan Storm, better known as Invisible Girl (or <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>) from the<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>. Most of the time, the female roles were powerful ones but were usually influential in terms of evil. For example, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a> would always romantically advance with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/2247/\">Henry Pym</a>, but he would always reject her advances as he had a very fatherly tone. Those two characters became important roles in the Marvel Universe, but during their first appearances, they would be seen as women trying to gain equality.</p><p>With the Invisible Girl, her early adventures always had the feel of romance and when she meets Prince <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>, he asks for her hand in marriage and if she agrees, he will never attack on land again. She unwillingly agrees, and he feels as if she is just sacrificing herself. The rest of the Fantastic Four show up and Namor goes back to the sea from the lack of backup.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"82296\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/82296-171047-mary-jane_super.jpg\" title=\"Mary Jane Watson: Woman With Confidence\"><img id=\"82296\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/82296-171047-mary-jane_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Jane Watson: Woman With Confidence\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mary Jane Watson: Woman With Confidence</div></div></div></div><p>Invisible Girl\u2019s brother, Johnny Storm who is known as the <a href=\"/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a> and finds a photograph of Namor and both struggle to get the picture when Johnny decides to burn it. After that, Namor attempts to enter the <a href=\"/baxter-building/34-41454/\">Baxter Building</a> and the Human Torch attacks him, but Invisible Girl stands in front of Namor and this romantic tension would define the image of Invisible Woman during the early years of Marvel.</p><p>Another example of romantic tension was the love triangle between Scott Summers (a.k.a. <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>) and Warren Worthington III (a.k.a. Angel, now known as <a href=\"/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>) and <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> when she goes to college.</p><p>Women in the <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> comics were also very prominent, as the notable ones were <a href=\"/mary-jane/29-13380/\">Mary Jane</a> Watson, <a href=\"/betty-brant/29-2484/\">Betty Brant</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\">Gwen Stacy</a>. A romantic tension that would appear was the appearance of MJ Parker who made Gwen Stacy jealous at a party. At the party they were to hand out burgers but instead they held a dancing competition.</p><h2>Bronze Age</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"139115\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5584/139115-109412-jean-grey_super.jpg\" title=\"Jean Grey: One of the major transformation to woman being respected\"><img id=\"139115\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5584/139115-109412-jean-grey_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Jean Grey: One of the major transformation to woman being respected\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Jean Grey: One of the major transformation to woman being respected</div></div></div></div><p>With the Bronze Age, the women roles were taken further with the ability to creatively bring out the equality in women, with little things like changing names to such things as a whole new change in them, whether it is physically or mentally.</p><h3>Transformations</h3><p>In the 1980s, writer-artist John Bryne had found new powers for Sue Storm. Not only were they powers as in her super abilities, but her personality-wise as well, where she developed a new found sense of confidence and with that she started using her powers more aggressively.</p><p>She then changed from Invisible Girl to Invisible Woman to show that she was now a mature woman, who was capable in making it on her own. She could now turn other people around her invisible, and could generate force fields that could pretty much stop anything. Jean Grey was perhaps the first to make a major transformation.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"93685\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1772/93685-132227-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"Ororo: The First Change in Diversity for Women in Comics\"><img id=\"93685\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1772/93685-132227-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ororo: The First Change in Diversity for Women in Comics\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ororo: The First Change in Diversity for Women in Comics</div></div></div></div><p>During the Bronze Age, she was romantically involved with Cyclops, but also had to deal with the advances from Wolverine. Jean Grey was then formed into the Phoenix and with that, it was a sign of the Women\u2019s Liberation Movement. It was a metaphoric sign that women were growing stronger each day.</p><h3>Leadership</h3><p>Men usually led the team. For example, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a> who was the leader for the Fantastic Four and Cyclops who was the leader of the on-field team of X-Men.</p><p>With time, Invisible Woman and the Wasp would chair the teams. With that, Marvel added more to it, by adding many different nationalities. One team member called Ororo Munroe, better known as <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> was the first African-American to be recruited in X-Men eventually succeeded Cyclops and would join Monica Rambeau, the second Captain Marvel as minorities in leadership positions. Ororo is highly respected and is a dependable person on the X-men and also highly regarded by Professor Xavier.</p><h3>Continuing On</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"127825\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/127825-36746-beverly-switzler_super.jpg\" title=\"Ex.

Beverly Switzler</div></div></div></div><p>With more time, women were gaining more and more important roles in comics. One example was Steve Gerber with his comic Howard the Duck which starred and Jennifer Kale in the Man-Thing. In Howard the Duck, Beverly talks Howard out of committing suicide and she is much like a mother towards Howard as his friendship with her was invaluable, helping him to cope of Earth because of that. Jennifer was made a prominent role, because she was the only human on Earth who had a psychic connection with Man-Thing.</p><p>Even though they both have strong roles, they are still portrayed as sex objects and victims. For example, Beverly makes ends meet by posing nude and her beauty usually gets her into trouble, one example is being capture by Dr. Bong who was obsessed with her during their teen years. This obsession allows Dr. Bong crave her even more and he soon wants to marry her and she marries him anyway in order to save Howard. Beverly was also captured by a sheik and Howard must save her. With Jennifer, she steals an enchanted book and accidentally summons a demon. Man-Thing manages to rescue her, and Jennifer manages to burn the book. Jennifer then apologizes for her behavior.</p><h2>Modern Age</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"34569\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/34569-5263-38612-1-supergirl_super.jpg\" title=\"Supergirl: One of the woman in comics to own her own comic book series\"><img id=\"34569\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/34569-5263-38612-1-supergirl_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Supergirl: One of the woman in comics to own her own comic book series\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Supergirl: One of the woman in comics to own her own comic book series</div></div></div></div><p>More and more readers during this time were very connected socially with their favorite characters and this allows the characters to seem as they exist in real life. Due to the development of women in comics, it produced various effects, especially in this time. There were still many strong portrayals of women and they were getting their own titles. One of them was Ghost from Dark Horse comics and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> from DC.</p><p>However, it was common that sex was still used to women comics as Ed Benes as come under scrutiny for providing skimpy outfits for Supergirl and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frank-cho/26-3169/\">Frank Cho</a>\u2019s Liberty Meadows where they had strong female characters, but used skimpy outfits at the same time. The bad girl trend would also continue, but soon met their end. They were still quite popular with the character Riptide from Image Comics posing nude for men\u2019s magazines and she was dismissed from her team, Team Young Blood in issue #14.</p><p>They continued with Gen, which was another popular comic series from the same publisher and the characters would usually appear in skimpy outfits holding guns.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"510667\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/510667-136233_13398_she_hulk_super_super.jpg\" title=\"She-Hulk in The Sensational She-Hulk #40\"><img id=\"510667\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/510667-136233_13398_she_hulk_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"She-Hulk in The Sensational She-Hulk #40\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">She-Hulk in The Sensational She-Hulk #40</div></div></div></div><p>It would continue in the next 10 years with examples such as Barb Wire from Dark Horse comics, Lady Death from Chaos! Comics and Mantra from the Malibu Universe and DC was even having their take on this trend. Like mentioned before, this trend came to a halt by the time the speculator market crashed. Sexually suggestive characters were then used by Marvel Comics as characters like Invisible Woman (Fantastic Four #375) and Scarlet Witch (Scarlet Witch #1) started to wear revealing outfits and <a href=\"/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> was skipping with a jump-rope nude in The Sensational She-Hulk #40.</p><p>The most prominent of them all is perhaps the White Queen, better known as <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>. She was always drawn in lingerie-like costumes, and she treated the people around her quite sadistically. At DC, Mike Deodato's run as an artist with Wonder Woman was known for having the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amazons-of-themyscira/42494/\">Amazons</a> in skimpy clothing (and the fact that all the Amazons were portrayed as Caucasian).</p><h2>Body Image</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"421406\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/421406-4065-batgirl_400_super.jpg\" title=\"Portrayal of how women are thought of today\"><img id=\"421406\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/421406-4065-batgirl_400_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Portrayal of how women are thought of today\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Portrayal of how women are thought of today</div></div></div></div><p>The issue of body image was gained from today\u2019s modern society, where many women in popular culture have been accused to altering the way people (girls in particular) should look and with that, it connects itself to gender identity.</p><p>One character who had broken out of the \u201cpopular culture mold\u201d was <a href=\"/francine/29-3640/\">Francine Peters</a> from <a href=\"/strangers-in-paradise/49-28995/\">Strangers in Paradise</a> who had a round face with a bit of fat under her chin. Her body was portrayed as chubby, as she had wide and round hips and her stomach was not flat nor did it have any abs, as most female characters were portrayed. She was objectified as being unattractive in her teenage years but following high-school her curve were seen as an asset by a number of her fellow characters ad her fuller figure made her an object of desire, even if she herself was not completely happy with it.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"511021\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/511021-209812_183321_lara_croft_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Ex.

At first, Marge rejects him because she thinks that Clark is only asking her out because he feels sorry for her and she tells him that after the dance, she will gone. Clark interprets this as if she is going to commit suicide. He then sees her stand on the edge of a bridge and yells at her to jump. After the confusion, Clark finds out that she will be gone to college due to an early admission.

Her career ends when she is tapped on the forehead and falls and breaks her spine, thus ending her career.</p><p>Also another example of how a woman in comics have been portrayed for her body image is Power Girl. Power Girl artwork was first done by Wally Wood who said that with each issue he would increase Power Girls breast. Eventually it was getting ridiculous of how large her breast had become to the point where DC didn't want to have Wally Wood to work on her issues anymore with DC saying that,\" it is becoming unrealistic of how big her chest has become\", so since then they toned done her chest even though it is still rather large . In Justice League#37, Crimson Fox attempts to explain Power Girls outfit by saying that her outfit shows people what she is. \"Female. Healthy. Strong. If men want to degrade themselves by staring and drooling and tripping over themselves, that's their problem, I'm not going to apologize for it.\"</p><h2>Evolving Themes</h2><p>With the 21st century, more and more people are opening to things which were probably taboos 50 years ago, and these include same-sex relationships, single parenting and positions of power in the workplace which have been used to define where women stand in today\u2019s society. With that, they have been included in themes of comics.</p><h2>Lesbian Relationships</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"511003\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><img id=\"511003\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/511003-__medium.jpg\" alt=\"An Example of Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn Relationship\" /><div class=\"item-caption\">An Example of Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn Relationship</div></div></div></div><p>Lesbian relationships have become more prominent.

(more about Mystique <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">here</a>)</p><p>Wonder Woman has also been speculated as being a lesbian, as there have been many subtle clues, but the most obvious one is probably where she lives, where Paradise Island is completely inhabited by women. This may prove that Wonder Woman is a lesbian, as this runs parallel to the Spartans, where boys, who were at a very young age, were to live away from their families and live in same-sex barracks (more about Wonder Woman <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/2048//#Girl-on-Girl%20Action%21\">here</a>).</p><p>Again the series <a href=\"/strangers-in-paradise/49-6115/\">Strangers in Paradise</a> explored the themes of same sex desire between <a href=\"/francine/29-3640/\">Francine</a> and <a href=\"/katchoo/29-3639/\">Katchoo</a>. Katchoo is lesbian (she has a very bad history with men but whether this informs her preference is never discussed) but Francine is not. Francine loves her friend greatly in a platonic fashion and feels impelled to respond but her religious up-bringing are a barrier to this and a love triangle forms.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"475742\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/475742-watta_shocker_super.jpg\" title=\"Poison Ivy kissing Supergirl\"><img id=\"475742\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/475742-watta_shocker_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Poison Ivy kissing Supergirl\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Poison Ivy kissing Supergirl</div></div></div></div><p>There have also been some speculation of Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy to have something of a sexual relationship since it is portrayed by Bruce Timm in his drawings.

(more about Poison Ivy <a href=\"/poison-ivy/29-1697/\">here</a>)</p><p>Another person who has been suspected of being a lesbian is Renee Montoya, also known as the Lady Question.

Where the Bad Girls were mainly portrayed as women with attitude, Good Girls could be seen as having a strong spirit. Where the Bad Girls dress with revealing clothing, the Good Girls dress with the provocative sexiness of the 40s. The Bad Girls were usually avengers (much like the super villain archetype) and the Good Girls were adventuresses, heroines, sidekicks or girls who just happen to find trouble in their wake. Most of the Good Girls were usually super heroines, but also came from other genres.</p><p>Examples of the Good Girls were Lady Luck and the Phantom Lady. Another example of a Good Girl was Sheena, who was created in 1937 where she was to do a knock-off with Tarzan. But rather than doing a knock-off, she was then included in Tarzan\u2019s storylines where she took the lead role. Her character was artistic, beautiful and smart and was a natural leader. She rescued men and had a male sidekick. Basically, it was the other way around.</p><p>The Phantom Lady also enjoyed being a lead character as a female in comics and was published by two different companies. The Phantom Lady was owned by studio and not the publisher, like many of the spin-offs by Jerry Iger and she was dropped by Quality. Fox bought her and she was in a new costume. With Quality, her costume was a backless yellow leotard with a green cape. With Fox, she wore a blue-halter top and tap pants which were also blue and a red cape. With both companies, she carried a \u201cblack light\u201d which was like a flashlight but it projected darkness instead of light. She wore no mask yet she was not unrecognizable by her boyfriend who was a detective. The Fox version of Lady Phantom was drawn by Matt Baker. He had drawn Sky Girl and Mysta of the Moon. He was known to draw them as beautiful, strong and independent and he had lots of detail in them. His characters were glamorous, but also had sense of realism which people could relate to. He also drew Phantom Lady in flat shoes rather than high heels, adding a sense of realism.</p><p>However, Phantom Lady\u2019s was infamous at one point, due to Dr. Frederic Wertham use, as he used her comic covers as an example of sexual bondage in his book Seduction of the Innocent though it is true that she is tied up thanks to Matt Baker\u2019s art. In comics, there is always conflict between the good and the evil. The good always defeats the evil, though if that is so, then the suspense and adventure is lost, so, the villain must win sometimes to keep the story going. So, for the evil to win, they must somehow capture the good guy, as opposed to killing the good guy which will obviously end the story. Seeing as anything involved with a woman must be sexual subconsciously, her confinement is bondage. If the villain had beaten her, it would be considered \u201cgraphic sexual violence\u201d and if the villain was a woman, the bondage or sexual violence becomes lesbian bondage.</p><p>In the case of art, the Good Girl had a great deal of sex appeal with the women featured, but the view of these comics which has been portrayed as sexy would perhaps be the views from its readers, which can be compared below.</p><p>Looking at the first picture of Phantom Lady, it is revealing, but compared to the second one it is not much. With this picture, there is no cleavage what-so-ever and half of the both of her thighs are covered up.</p><p>It is more revealing here and this is much sexier than the first one and the second one is usually used in modern comics today where the cover is spiced up than they are portrayed in the comic themselves. There is cleavage showing and a bit has been cut out on the sides of her body. There are also slits on her very short skirt. On the cover, there is also rope tied around her wrist, again, making a reference to the confinement of women in comics and how it is usually portrayed.</p><p>The third picture, it is even skimpier with a V-neck that plunges all the way down to her waste and her bottom half of clothing is almost like a piece of cloth.</p><p>However, the portrayal and popularity of Good Girls was due to the fact of the audience where they were a wide variety of people, where in the modern comics, the majority of the audience is based on male teenage readers. On the other hand, Lady Phantom wouldn\u2019t have dressed like that if she were only to appeal to female audiences. Other characters like Sheena were created for general audiences as she was an elaboration on the Tarzan theme. She may have been revealing, but then Tarzan himself was just as revealing. When we think of the early 1900s, we usually think where men ruled, but certain characters\u2019 traits made them original and different, such as their man-like strengths and alluring looks. Of course, there were story lines where the woman, who was sexy and alluring, would base her dependency only on the men, where they would have to save them from the villain. Sometimes the hero would receive an award and sometimes usually more than just a reward. But there were also strong portrayals of men and they too were attractive and popular.</p><h3>Bad Girl Role</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"212649\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne_super.jpg\" title=\"Example of Bad Girl Role.\"><img id=\"212649\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9993/212649-111851-avengelyne_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Example of Bad Girl Role.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Example of Bad Girl Role.</div></div></div></div><p>Come to the 1990s where there was a huge contrast from the 1940s, where the costumes there weren\u2019t as skimpy and revealing, and the woman\u2019s intentions were always good. So does someone go about defining Bad Girls?</p><p>They can often be women who have been abused during their childhood or had their parents killed and now seek vengeance in their sexually revealing, skimpy and provocative outfits. By revealing, skimpy and provocative outfits, it was usually a few strips of clothing and they would wield a sharp weapon.</p><p>Their art had reminded readers of theological or occult origins, such as demons, angels and vampires. Their art also had drawn women with breasts as big as their heads, long thighs (or legs in general), long spines and leg bones shaped like an \u201cS\u201d.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"330572\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15530/330572-40085-vampirella_super.jpg\" title=\"Vampirella\"><img id=\"330572\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15530/330572-40085-vampirella_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Vampirella\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vampirella</div></div></div></div><p>The archetypal Bad Girl type is Lady Death who is usually credited as the character that started or at least popularised the trend.</p><p>Avengelyne isn\u2019t an extreme example of the Bad Girl role, though she still has the same traits such as wielding a bladed weapon and revealing clothing. The Bad Girls weren\u2019t such a new phenomenon but with their extremity is what caused a bit of a stir. Looking back twenty years, Vampirella and Elektra we can see traits from the Bad Girls (both have also become modern Bad Girls too).</p><p>Vampirella, as a vampire was a heroic figure rather than a dark one. She lived on the planet of Drakulon, where it was very dark with river that was filled with blood. She was dressed with revealing clothing, though she posed with some cheesecake poses back in the 40s than an avenger.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"85330\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/85330-79846-elektra_super.jpg\" title=\"Elektra: The Assassin\"><img id=\"85330\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/85330-79846-elektra_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Elektra: The Assassin\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Elektra: The Assassin</div></div></div></div><p>As a guest star in Daredevil, Elektra had many things in common with the Golden Age Catwoman as they were both villains and had romantic ties with the heroes in their comics. Elektra being created in the 80s had ambiguous morals. She was a cold-blooded killer, an assassin yet when she died at the end of her story-arc, readers felt a sense of loss. She was a woman in which Daredevil could love and we could predict the sort of love life she would have. Lots of comic book characters become resurrected, but that would only cheapen Elektra\u2019s come back. So Frank Miller completely did a full blown makeover of her resurrection with a dark ritual in a torn down church and thus bringing the dark aspects of the Bad Girl role. Miller and his team-up with Bill Seinkewitz also brought out the violent aspect of comics. Elektra\u2019s resurrection was seen as something new because the writers used aspects from images and techniques rather than traditional comic book characters. Modern Bad Girls today are perhaps not as innovative today. They may be more profane and excessive, but they have little choices in the directions in which they go.</p><h2>Birds of Prey</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1092263\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day_super.jpg\" title=\"Birds Of Prey\"><img id=\"1092263\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1092263-birds_of_prey___brightest_day_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Birds Of Prey\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Birds Of Prey</div></div></div></div><p>DC's Birds of Prey is an all female crime fighting team.

        "description":"<h2>Definition</h2><p>Retcon or <strong>retroactive continuity</strong> is a term that is used when writers reveal something new to a previous story already told which usually changes the original back story to something new. The term \"Retroactive Continuity\" was made known by All-Star Squadron writer Roy Thomas in the 1980s. Damian Cugley shortened the word to \"Retcon\" when Alan Moore re-wrote the origins of Swamp Thing in 1988.</p><p>At its simplest it can be a piece of information that alters a characters background, shedding some light on their reasoning and at worst a contradiction of a fundamental aspect or plot point of a characters previous established story arcs. The nature of comics to be the amalgam of many artists, writers and even publishers has the obvious flaw of over time their story becoming convoluted and errors and omission are bound to occur and means that ret-con can be as much of a plot device as it can be tool to correct previous errors.</p><h2>List of Retcons</h2><p><strong><em>DC Universe related retcons</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>In Crisis on Infinite Earths after all the alternate Earths were destroyed, many heroes including Superman and Wonder Woman had their entire origins retconned and thus their series rebooted.</p></li><li><p>In Infinite Crisis: Secret Files, there were several retcons that had an on-panel source. When Superboy Prime punched the barrier of reality he caused changes throughout the DC Universe including the resurrection of Jason Todd and the reboot of the Doom Patrol.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Batman related retcons</em></strong></p><ul><li><p>The original killer of Thomas and Marth Wayne, Joe Chill was captured, however DC retconned it so the killer was never actually captured.</p></li><li><p>Barbara Gordon was retconned to be Commissioner James Gordon's niece in Batman: Year One. Originally she was Jim's blood-related daughter.</p></li><li><p>Bette Kane, the original Golden Age Batgirl, was retconned out of DC continuity to become Flamebird, a daredevil acrobat member of the Teen Titans West.</p></li></ul><p><strong><em>Daredevil related retcons</em></strong></p><ul><li>When Frank Miller took over the run for Daredevil, he retconned Daredevil's history so that Stick, an Asian man, helped him develop and master his new abilities.</li></ul><p><i><b>Marvel Universe related retcons</b></i></p><ul><li>In Tales of Suspense #64 <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> was told that if she stopped working for Russia, her parents would be killed. Years later, it was retconned that her parents had apparently died in a house fire when she was very young.</li><li>At the end of his first appearance, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a> died, but it was later retconned that he had had his brain patterns recorded just before dying (to help create the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>), and then later retconned again that Wonder Man hadn't died, but gone into a sort of hibernation state whilst his body evolved from the ionic rays he'd been exposed to (despite that Vision had visited Wonder Man's grave in Avengers #66).</li></ul><p><em><b>Spider-Man related retcons</b></em></p><ul><li><p>During the Clone Saga, Mary Jane had a baby and Aunt May died at the end of the story arc. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-michael-straczynski/26-40683/\">J. Michael Straczynski</a> took over Spider-Man in 2001, he retconned it so those two events \"never happened.\"</p></li><li><p>Gwen Stacy's past was retconned when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-michael-straczynski/26-40683/\">J. Michael Straczynski</a> wrote the Sins Past story arc. This revealed that Gwen Stacy had an affair with Norman Osborn when she was in Europe mourning the death of her father.</p></li><li>During One More Day, it was made that Spider-Man's marriage to Mary Jane never happened. And he lost his Other powers.</li></ul><p><strong><em>X-Men related retcons</em></strong></p><ul><li>The Phoenix Saga was originally created by Chris Claremont for the Phoenix to actually be Jean Grey at the peak of her potential. Years after Jean's death, Marvel wanted to bring Jean back. However, bringing her back at first would bring many complications. If Jean were to be brought back, she would still be guilty for killing millions of life forms. Marvel announced that they would not bring back Jean unless someone creates a suitable resurrection story. Kurt Busiek (then a college student) and a few friends started pitching ideas. Eventually he would retcon Phoenix into a cosmic entity, and while Jean was piloting the shuttle, the Phoenix approached her and made an exact duplicate to use. While also merging with a portion of her soul, therefore freeing Jean from the guilt of murder.</li></ul><h3><em>Wildstorm Universe related retcons</em></h3><ul><li>After the events of Captain Atom: Armageddon, parts of the WSU were retconned in what was termed a \"soft reboot\", since not everything was erased. The past stories of some teams and characters, most notably Gen 13, Deathblow and WetWorks were completely restarted, erasing all their previous stories (and connections with other teams and characters) from the history of the Wildstorm Universe. Others, like The Authority and Wildcats, were unaffected, and in a few cases, some characters have vague memories of previous connections with characters that they knew before Armageddon but were involved in the retcon. One character, John Lynch, even seems to know that he (and others) are not the original versions of themselves.</li></ul>",

        "description":"<br /><p>This page is not quite a comic page, per se. </p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Introduction</h2><p>This page does not tell about a hero, villain, place, object, concept, etc. This page is a Comic Vine guide. If you are a new user or even someone who is a good submitter (just not a Fesak-like robot), you will find this page invaluable. This page is a research guide-how to do good research to write the best possible Comic Vine page.</p><p>Just because you are a great submitter doesn't mean this won't help. I only learned how to research beyond basics (i.e, Wikipedia, Marvel.com, etc.) when I had over 5000 points! There are lots of useful strategies in here. And if you find a method to submitting that I haven't mentioned, you must put it in-this needs as many good strategies as it can get.</p><p>This page also will include little tricks and tips and how to do certain things on the Vine. Many different users have originated their own methods which were quickly adapted. I've tried to find and explain them all.</p><p>Enjoy! I hope this will help you in some way-this would have helped me.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>The Basics</h2><p>The first thing to do is find out what you're good at. Are you a writer, like Buckshot or Prodigious Man? Are you good with images, like Fesak or Mighty Magneto? Do you like short, low submissions (with a huge number of them), like Shatterstar? Or do you like them all? I happen to be a writer, so that's where this guide is most aimed. But images and others are detailed.</p><p>Let's say you want to do a submission. I'll do this in steps.</p><p>One-Find a page that needs work on whatever area. Maybe you noticed that your favorite character's page is empty. or that there's barely any info on a major character. Most of the time, this won't happen. My favorite character is Batman, but ZeroEdge wrote a huge page on him and there's nothing for me to do. So I did Captain America. If you happen to be a fan of smaller publishers, this is easy. MShades got loads of points off Vertigo characters and pages-he loved Vertigo, and no one else had heard of them. So he wrote a huge Jesse Custer page and a giant Tulip page and a Saint of Killers page, and got huge points just by knowing the characters. Buckshot also did this with Wildstorm. He's a huge Wildstorm fan, so he wrote a giant Helspont and Mr. Majestic. Even if you aren't a big fan of small ones-it helps if you are.</p><p>Two-Start the research process. I will detail research later, but basically, get as much research done as you can. More on research later.</p><p>Three-Start writing. Once you've got an idea of how much information you have, start with your outline. For the Captain America page, I took a basic structure and made the outline of each section. For instance, I was going to have a small intro in the beginning, so on Word, I wrote-</p><a> </a><h2>Captain America</h2><p>//Incomplete//</p><p>Then I figured I would do his origin and World War II years. So I made a heading-</p><a> </a><h2>History I</h2><p>//Incomplete//</p><p>I later changed it to \"1940s World War II Cap\", or something like that. But I basically went through, making a heading for each section with \"Incomplete\". Then I started to fill in each section. This helped because it meant I could write it in any order.</p><p>Four-Write it. This step just means taking all of your research and writing the page. If you followed Step 3, you can do the sections in any order you like. How you submit it is up to you. Some people have different ways. Once I've got my outline, I submit that, then submit whatever I did that day a bit at a time. So while writing, the actual Comic Vine page will have some headings \"//Incomplete//\". Some people like to do it all in one submission. Writing place also varies. I personally like to write on Word. Some people like Appleworks. Some people use the Comic Vine page instead of pasting it in. It's up to you. I recommend trying different methods and seeing which you like best.</p><p>Five-Little touches. Once it's written, there are only a few small touches to add. Link it up (this will be detailed later). If it's big enough, do a Select Your Destination thing (again, this will be detailed later). Then sit back, look at the page, count the points, check your standing, and grin, satisfied. Maybe brag a little to yourself. And then start over.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Internet Sources</h2><br /><p>As the name implies, this is a research guide at heart-because research is probably the most important step. This section details how to research and different resources.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Wikipedia</h2><p>Link: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Wikipedia</a></p><p>This is it. The big one. The site that is probably the biggest shadow over Comic Vine. Wikipedia is a huge site. Gargantuan. Amazingly packed with information. Imagine Comic Vine with every page having over 1000 points worth of information. That's Wikipedia. Many Comic Vine pages have been written using only Wikipedia as a resource. Here are some tips to using Wikipedia at it's best.</p><p>Don't just use the main character page-Many times, people look, see a big page on a random hero on Wikipedia, and use that as the only resource. For instance, for the S.H.I.E.L.D page, I used many resources-one of which was the Wikipedia page. But here's a list of the Wikipedia pages I used for S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>The S.H.I.E.L.D Page-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D</p><p>The Nick Fury Page-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Fury</p><p>The HYDRA Page-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HYDRA</p><p>The AIM Page-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Idea_Mechanics</p><p>The List Of S.H.I.E.L.D Members Page-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S.H.I.E.L.D._members</p><p>The S.T.R.I.K.E Page-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.T.R.I.K.E.</p><p>And remember, I used more places then Wikipedia. Many times, researching a character's enemies will tell you about the character.</p><p>Paraphrase Well-Many sites, including Marvel.com and Answers.com, are nearly worthless for comic information? Why? Because it's members basically just get the Wikipedia page, paraphrase it badly, then write an article in the same order and with the same information as the Wikipedia page. They're Wikipedia-clones (henceforth referred to as W-Cs). If you don't paraphrase well enough, people will look at our beloved Comic Vine and think, \"Just another W-C!\"</p><p>Wikipedia Is Not Your Only Resource-This seems obvious, but you must remember it. There are lots of Wikipedia pages that are huge enough that you could write a 400 point Comic Vine article on them using that page only. Doing that seems easy-but don't do it. The Mary Marvel page is huge on Wikipedia-but Prodigious Man used loads of other resources and wrote a 2000 point article on Mary Marvel. Don't limit yourself, or we'll be a Wiki-clone.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Marvel.com</h2><p>Marvel.com is a site similar to Comic Vine in that it's a user-submitted wiki site with an encyclopedia. Marvel.com only has Marvel characters, so that's a minor setback. Overall-it's an okay site-but there are major flaws that bring it down. Here's some tips and notes on the site.</p><p>Don't Waste Time-The link to Marvel.com is here-http://www.marvel.com/. This is the page most people immediately go to on Marvel.com. However, Marvel.com is largely a news site-plus a place to peddle toys, comics, video games, advertisements, and more-plus have blogs, podcasts, and more. Remember, it's the official Marvel site, so a lot of it is merchandise. The place you're looking for with research and bios would be here-http://www.marvel.com/universe/?utm_campaign=front page tracking&amp;utm_source=universe nav link&amp;utm_medium=nav link&amp;utm_content=universe. It's Marvel Universe-and this is where to go to actually get information.</p><p>It's A W-C-Marvel.com is one of many sites that falls victim to the same thing-it is largely a W-C. Most of their pages' only research comes from Wikipedia. Only occasionally will you find a major page that isn't directly-and badly-paraphrased from Wikipedia. Often, most of the reason it's not total plagiarism is because of long, flowery things and pointless extra details-while Wikipedia is short and concise. Use Marvel.com as a secondary resource-most of the information can be found on you-know-where.</p><p>Don't Overlook It, Though-Marvel.com is useful in certain scenarios, though. I often use it for \"Other Aliases\"-because it has every other name that character has ever been called. It has great descriptions of powers, weapons, and abilities-usually better then other places. And, when you're starting research, it's always worth checking out Marvel's page. I've found a few times pages on there that weren't W-Cs and were extremely helpful. Also, apply the Wikipedia rule about using more then one page.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>DCcomics.com</h2><p>This site is entirely a news, merchandise, and downloads site-avoid it completely. Here's the link in case you would like to check it out-</p><p>http://www.dccomics.com/</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>The Unofficial Guide To The DC Universe.com</h2><p>This is an extremely valuable site when it comes to DC matters. Nearly every DC character imaginable is in here. If there's a DC character you need information on, he will be in here. The link is here-http://www.dcuguide.com/</p><p>But the place you really want is here-http://www.dcuguide.com/Who_Home.php.</p><p>How It Works-This is basically a huge index and grouping of DC characters. There are two kinds of articles. There's the small Who's Who articles-these have the character information and a few lines of description. And then there's the Biographies, which they do on major characters. The Biographies have much more text and information. The Biographies will only be on characters like Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman-so don't go looking for small characters with loads of info.</p><p>Not a W-C-This is very important. The Unofficial Guide To The DC Universe.com is not a W-C. All text in here is mostly researched from previous knowledge and the DC books. That means that this site is always worth checking when you want information about a DC character.</p><p>The Problem-The problem with this site is this-there is not a huge load of information on here. Even on huge characters, the entire thing is maybe 100-200 points. If you are looking for a site that will support an entire Comic Vine article, then you will either have to write a very small article or look elsewhere. Also, the site only does DC characters-I know that's the point, but it is a flaw.</p><p>Still, it's not a W-C, and there's a little information on nearly every character. If you are doing a DC character, then this site is definitely worth checking for extra information that you might not have found elsewhere. </p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>About.com-Comic Books</h2><p>About.com covers just about everything imaginable-comic books included. It has it's own little comic book site, here's the link-</p><p>http://comicbooks.about.com/</p><p>Barely Any Info-There are exactly 31 profiles of comic characters on Answers.com. These characters are only heroes (no villains), largely paraphrased from Wikipedia (although relatively well), and there is barely any information on them. This is not a good site. Check it as a last resort only-don't waste your time looking for good info when you could be at a multitude of better sites.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Spiderfan.org</h2><p>This site is totally devoted to our favorite web-slinger, Spider-Man. Through this guide, I'm not including pages devoted to single characters-the Superman, Batman, Captain America, and other pages are being ignored. They've got great info-on only one character. Besides, all three of those Comic Vine pages are pretty full. But Spiderfan.org actually has info on every character in the Spider-Man \"universe\". Here's the link-http://www.spiderfan.org/index.shtml. But the page with all the information is here-</p><p>http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/index.html</p><p>Not A W-C-I actually emailed the guy who created this site about this. Spiderfan.org is entirely researched by books, like Ultimate Guides and Handbooks. It actually predates the creation of Wikipedia itself. If you don't have the books, or even if you do, Spiderfan pages are always worth checking.</p><p>Strength-This site's greatest strength is in small, 100 point articles. There is enough info for 100 points on nearly every character there, and there's often information not found on other sites. It is best used if you are not working on something huge-just a little group of articles you can write very fast. It's also worth checking if you're writing a big article-there's usually some info there you wouldn't be able to find elsewhere.</p><p>The Problem-This will seem obvious, but it's the big problem with Spiderfan.org-only Spider-Man characters make it in. Any DC or any non-Spidey related character will not be found anywhere near this site, and if it is, it'll be a tiny article. The Spider-Man article itself simply tells you to read the comic books along with some quick facts-it doesn't come close to ZeroEdge's 2000 point juggernaut on the Comic Vine article.</p><p>This site was something I discovered just now while writing this guide-this is even helping me, too. It's a textbook example of a site created by one guy that gained staff members-and through research and hard work, became a respectable site. It's on the Top Ten results if you Google \"Spider-Man\". It's a site we should aspire to be-just with more characters and longer articles.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Hyperborea.com-Flash</h2><p>This site is very similar to Spiderfan.org-it is a detailed profile of one character and all characters related to him. This time, the character is Flash. It has detailed information on all four Flashes, his enemies, people around him, other heroes, events, etc., etc. </p><p>Look at the three things on Spiderfan.org. Many of these are the same here.</p><p>Here's the link-http://www.hyperborea.org/flash/</p><p>Where It's Useful-This site is useful in writing small, 40-50 point articles about characters related to Flash. There is a multitude of characters-and although there isn't much text on them, you can write okay articles using the info here. The place they're most useful is in Flash's Enemies, and Friends And Family pages. I'm currently working on both of these, but if you need a quick article, this is an okay place.</p><p>The Problem Revisited-This is the same problem as with Spiderfan. Only Flash pages are detailed, and the articles are too small to get big stuff off. The pages on the four Flashes are okay.</p><p>However, this is definitely not a W-C-the info must have come from previous knowledge and actual comic books. This is a good site and is useful in certain scenarios.</p><p>Answers.com is our last website, and it doesn't even get a full heading. Why? It's the quintessential W-C. On the other W-Cs, it's paraphrased badly. On Answers.com, it is literally copied and pasted from Wikipedia. Every single comic book article. Never go there-it's a waste of time.</p><br /><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Non-Internet Sources</h2><p>These are the sources that aren't on the Internet, that you have to go somewhere other then your computer chair to check. These can be extremely helpful, too.</p><a> </a><h2>The Marvel/DC Encyclopedias</h2><p>These two are actually books. They come in expensive, so it's better to already have them. But they're okay sources.</p><p>Not Much Info-The Marvel Encyclopedia and the DC Universe Encyclopedia both are full of characters-they have a little information on nearly every character and a lot of information on some of the big ones. However, with all the characters, they can't put in too much info for each one. No character, not even Superman, has an article above maybe 150 points-at the most with chars like Superman. Most clock in at 10-20. It also isn't very updated-2004 or 2005 is the cutoff. This problem could not be avoided in a book, but it still applies.</p><p>Uses-These two books do have their uses, however. Both have good powers descriptions-although both Marvel.com and Wikipedia have better ones. Also, they both have such an array of characters that you can always find info about someone in there. Overall-both good-both worth a shot. Maybe not worth the money if you don't have them, though.</p><p>This applies for the Ultimate Guide series and the Official Handbook to the Marvel Universe, too. Many of these books are held down by the fact that they cost money and are books-you can't have half the info there is on a site like our friend Wikipedia.</p><a> </a><h2>Actual Comic Books</h2><p>Mary Marvel. Drizzt Do'urden. Arwyn. Hank Pym. Booster Gold. Mr. Majestic. These huge pages all have one thing in common. All of these were researched using the greatest resource-actual comic books. No matter how much info you find, unless you're writing about Spider-Man, Batman, or Superman, you're not getting above 1000 points using only the Internet. It might be possible. I doubt it. No, the best place to go in real comic books.</p><p>Use Your Own-If you happen to have a huge comic book collection, then dig through and find every single comic book that whatever character was in. Then, arrange them in chronological order. Once you've done that, seperate them into storylines. For instance, you might have four comic books in a row dealing with a certain major event. So that event is one section with a heading, and those four comic books are your research tools. Write out a plan-write your headings and which comic books will be used for which headings-then put it on Word. Then fill it all in. And submit it.</p><p>Depending on the number of comic books you had, your point total could range from 400 to 1500. But you're not done. Time to web-crunch. Use above sites to fill in additional information about the character. Once you've done all this, you should have a huuuuge article. That's how they all were built, and it's the easiest, quickest way to get points.</p><p>I Don't Have A Huge Collection-Me neither. I don't have enough comic books to write anything more then 100 points on any given character. Oh well. There's other resources.</p><p>And A Tip-If you just need a few more comic books for information, buy em'. Coldblood-6 used a huge collection of Avengers books and the Net on Hank Pym. But he didn't have the early Hank stories-so he bought Essential Ant-Man and got enough info to help make a huge, 2000 point page. Don't try and buy enough to do a whole character if you don't have the ca$h-it's just a smart move.</p><a> </a><h2>Previous Knowledge</h2><p>Combine It-This combined with comic books can be one of your most potent weapons, and it's the only way to break 2000 points. Do you love a character? Know everything about him? Have loads of comic books about him? If he doesn't have a huge page already, you can write a large page with only that. </p><p>You Can Use It Without Other Resources-If you don't have the comic books, it's still possible to collect 500 points off background knowledge and do no research whatsoever. I know-I've done it. I've never bought a Star Wars comic book in my life-and yet I wrote Obi-Wan Kenobi without doing any research. It's possible.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Comic Vine Techniques</h2><p>There are many techniques on Comic Vine that can be used to get points. These are detailed here.</p><br /><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Pictures</h2><p>These are one of those things that Fourpower is no good at (I'm speaking in third person). This is the first big hole in the Guide-I don't know how to add pics to a character's main page. But...many people do. If you do, and you're reading this, then add it. Please. This has gotta be ultimate, and it ain't ultimate without pics on pages.</p><p>However, doing images on the image galleries is pretty simple, so I'll explain it.</p><p>First-Go to Google and go to Images. </p><p>Second-Type in a keyword for what you're trying to find a picture of-i.e, if you're doing Hulk's Image Galleries, then type in \"hulk\". Remember to use many keywords. Don't just do Hulk. Try \"bruce banner\", \"incredible hulk\", etc., etc. Also, be imaginative. Make other galleries, so there's Ultimate Hulk pics, black and white pics, movie pics from Hulk's movie, stuff like that.</p><p>Third-Go to the page of just the image (just a blank screen and an image, the link is at the top on Google Images). Drag it onto your Desktop.</p><p>Fourth-Go to that character's Image Galleries page and click Edit. Then go down to the right gallery and click Select Your File (or something like that). Choose the file from your folder. It will upload it, then the file will be on there! Simple as that.</p><p>You will recieve TWO (2) points for each image you upload. This is not a big point getter. Also, the file uploaded must be a .jpg.</p><p>Note: That's how you do it on a Mac. If it's different on Windows, then someone please add it on.</p><p>Images on Pages-//Incomplete until someone helps out//&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp;I suggest reading <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guides/xerox-kittys-unofficial-guide-to-using-the-galleries/78/\"> Xerox-Kitty's Unofficial Guide to Using the Galleries</a> before uploading any images.<br /></p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Enemies and Friends and Family</h2><p>When you look at a page, often what you see immediately is the main summary. But if you look to the left, there's a list of other things on the character. There's Issues, Enemies, Friends and Family, Trivia, etc., etc. What people often don't realize is that there's a gold mine of points in those little ones.</p><p>Enemies are the easiest. Again, I'll do steps.</p><p>First-Find a major character without his enemies page filled in. There are loads. Let's say you pick Silver Surfer.</p><p>Second-Do web searches. Type in different keywords, like \"Silver Surfer\", \"Silver Surfer's enemies\", and \"Defenders enemies\". What you want to do is find as many enemies of Silver Surfer as you can. Just find the enemies themselves. Remember, just because they mostly fight other people doesn't mean you can't put in them as a Surfer enemy as long as they've ever fought Surfer. For instance, Doctor Doom mostly fights the Fantastic Four. But he has fought Silver Surfer occasionally, so he's an enemy. Defenders enemies also count, Surfer was in the Defenders.</p><p>Third-Submit them all onto Silver Surfer's enemies page. If they don't have a Comic Vine page, create it. Just make sure you've got as many enemies as you possibly can on the page.</p><p>Fourth-Time to start writing. Do a quick websearch on each enemy-Wikipedia is helpful. Then fill in information on times he's battled Silver Surfer. Try and write enough that a little scroll bar shows up on each enemy. It takes longer, but it's worth it. </p><p>Your point count will depend on how many enemies and how much you wrote for each one.</p><p>Onward to Friends and Family...</p><p>First-Friends and Family is not so easy. If it's a Marvel character, go on Marvel.com, they have a list of every character related by family to your character-especially if it's a major character. If it's DC, use other Internet sources-The Unofficial Guide To The DC Universe is helpful here. Just write down all the family. Now think of all the superheroes your guy has ever been friends with, worked with, or been on a team with. Technicalities help-like, if a character worked for S.H.I.E.L.D for a while, S.H.I.E.L.D members count as their friends. </p><p>Second-Now, submit all of those names on the page. If they don't have a page, create it-it's easy and helpful. </p><p>Third-Use the same principle as with the Enemies. Here's the instructions again-\"Do a quick websearch on each person-Wikipedia is helpful. Then fill in information on times he's battled your hero. Try and write enough that a little scroll bar shows up on each enemy. It takes longer, but it's worth it.\"</p><p>This isn't worth as many points, but it's still useful.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>Creating characters is a simple manuever, but it's helpful to get points no one can steal...unless the page is already created...</p><p>How To Create Characters</p><p>First-Go down to the bottom of any Comic Vine page. You should see a row of links in the black-About Us, EnemyKite.com, etc., etc. Go down to Submission Guidelines and click it.</p><p>Second-Scroll down the page until you see How To Create Characters. There will be a bunch of links saying \"Create A Hero\" or \"Create A Concept\" or Object, or whatever. Click on the one relative to the sort of page you want to create.</p><p>Third-You'll see a list of things you see on a normal Comic Vine page-Name, Aliases, Description, etc.,etc. Fill it in however you want. You can write nothing or the whole page. Either works. If you need to, explain why you're creating the page. Then click Submit.</p><p>Even if you have over 1000 points and live edit, you will still have to wait 24 hours for your page to come up. Once it does, you can get started.</p><p>Writing New Pages</p><p>Now, this is different. You don't actually get points from creating a Comic Vine character. You get the points from writing.</p><p>It depends on the character you created, really. Viz is a small, independent publisher that does manga. JB3R was a big manga fan, so he created Viz and a whole bunch of manga characters no one who doesn't read Viz has ever heard of. He must be a fan, so he filled in 400-500-600 point pages on all of them (and higher on some). He didn't have to do research because he already had all the manga comic books.</p><p>Are you a fan of independent publishers such as Viz? If so, there's a gold mine of points. Create the page for all of your characters-then just use real comics and your knowledge to write pages on them.</p><p>This is extremely useful and a very quick way to get a lot of points.</p><p>If the page you are creating is a character from Marvel or DC, then you won't get nearly as many points-there won't be as much information. Just put in as much as you can-your point total will vary.</p><p>Character creation is a skill that most don't use right off, unless you're an indie fan. If you are, use it well. If not, oh well-it's useful for Friends and Family and Enemies pages, plus if you notice a hole in the Comic Vine database.</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Issue Summaries</h2><p>Issue summaries are the quickest way to get points if you have a huge comic book collection. Even if you don't, it's still worth a lot of points.</p><p>How To Write A Summary</p><p>First-Find the comic book you want to do a summary on. I'll detail finding it later. Just get the comic book you want directly by you.</p><p>Second-There are two ways to write a summary. You can either do it page-by-page or whole book. Page-by-page is when you read a few panels, then summarize them, then read a few more, then summarize them. This takes about half an hour to do a whole book, but you average about 100 points an issue. Whole book is to read the entire comic book straight through, then summarize it. This isn't worth as many points, but it's easier and faster.</p><p>Third-If you're doing page-by-page, then do what's mentioned up there. Read a little, write a little, read a little, write a little. It takes a while, but you will get more points.</p><p>Fourth-If you're doing whole book, again, do what's shown above. Read the whole book then summarize it as best you can.</p><p>Finding Comic Books</p><p>There are many different ways to get comic books to summarize. </p><p>-Your Collection: This is the easiest. You have a collection, right? (If you don't, you're in the wrong place-you should at least have three or four). Find the comic book (you may have to create it). Then do your summary. Unless you have a large collection, this will wear out fast.</p><p>-Buy New Ones: New comic books come out every Thursday. Go buy a comic book, add it, and summarize it! G-Man almost has a monopoly on the new ones, but there's no reason you can't do one he doesn't have on already. As for scanning covers, I have no idea. If you know how and you're reading, this is an order-GIVE AN EXPLANATION OR I SHALL EAT YOUR SOUL!</p><p>Explanation On How To Scan Covers-//Incomplete Until Someone Helps Out//</p><p>-Collections: Marvel puts out collections of old comic books all the time. The Ultimate series is useful for this. I bought Ultimate Daredevil (after saving for four weeks) and plan on writing a summary on all 25 issues. There's also a million little books that have three or four comic books you can buy. DC is less thorough and has less of them, but there's still loads to find and do.</p><p>-DVD-ROMS: Marvel has put out a series of $50.00 DVD-ROMs of major series such as Fantastic Four, Avengers, Spider-Man, etc. These DVD-ROMs have every issue of that series from it's beginning to 2004! That's over 400 issues per DVD-ROM-in color and with all advertisements and pages. If you have the cash, BUY THESE! IT's an amazing amount of comic books and summaries sitting right on your computer. 25 issues of Daredevil for 20 bucks, or 450 issues of Daredevil for about twice that. Hmmmm...</p><p><a> </a></p><a> </a><h2>Linking</h2><p>Linking is not something that will get you a lot of points. Linking is a necessary part of writing large pages, though, so it's recommended that you know how to link and can do it quickly.</p><p>How To Link</p><p>First-Go on a page where the proper nouns are not linked. Find a proper noun that isn't linked that you can link to another Comic Vine page. Let's say Batman is mentioned but not linked. Go down to the Link Builder and click \"Create A Link\". </p><p>Second-You will see a search bar with some text under it. The search bar should say Type Your Link, or something like that. Delete that and type \"Batman\". Type it quickly. If you stop typing, even just for a second, it will look for \"Batm\", which will find nothing. Get \"Batman\" all the way out before it starts to search.</p><p>Third-You'll see a list of pages with \"Batman\" in the title. Batman's page, the Batman comic book series page, Batgirl, etc., etc. Click the top one, Batman's page. Click the black text that says \"Batman\". Just once. Double click and it will take you to the Batman page and you'll lose all work on that edit, unless you saved it.</p><p>Fourth-The page will then delete itself. You will see in the search bar on the Link Builder-two [[, the name of the page, then char:, four numbers, then [[. Highlight the whole thing and copy it. Then paste it over \"Batman\" in the normal description. It will look text-y. But when you save it, it will be a link to Batman.</p><p>There are a few tips on linking, too.</p><p>Don't Overdo It</p><p>If you link a page once in an article, that's enough-once. Don't link every time that character is mentioned. If Batman was mentioned again in the aforementioned page, you would not link it. Just link once. You'll notice tht I've got more then one link on the same page here. That's on purpose. You might need to see a page for this Guide more then once. I don't want you to have to scroll all the way up to the link to get to that page and see whatever I want you to see on it. Unless you have circumstances like this, DON'T OVERLINK.</p><p>Write First, Link Later</p><p>Don't link while in the process of writing. If you use the Comic Vine page, then don't do it. If you write it somewhere else then paste it in, it's impossible. Linking is part of the \"Final Touches\" stage. Linking as you write will slow you down.</p><p>Don't Expect Crazy Pointage</p><p>Linking is not worth a tremendous amount of points. Even if you're doing a crazy overlinking job. I once, before I learned not to overlink, did links for every page in a 1000 point article and got 150 points. Linking is a little touch, nothing more.</p><h2> <br /></h2>",

This list is not perfect and should be seen more as a guide than anything else. Also, the rankings don't necessarily reflect how characters would fare in a one-on-one fight. The list really only takes into account the general power levels of characters, not necessarily how they would use their powers, so while a very intelligent character might actually be able to beat a more powerful character higher up, that doesn't automatically make them a higher rank. This is a more accurate list than the power rankings but it is still not perfect so take it with a grain of salt.

The DC Multiverse first appeared in The Flash #123 when Barry Allen ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>) found himself in another universe that was separated from his own by being on a different vibrational frequency. This world came to be known as Earth-Two and was populated by the heroes of the \"Golden Age\" of comics (the 40's and 50's). After this, more worlds were found, and then even more, until finally DC decided it was time to put an end to the expansion of the Multiverse. As was mentioned before, the other worlds were destroyed during the Crisis, but here is a list of the known Earth's before they were lost.</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Earth-1</h3></td></tr><tr><td>Home of the Silver Age heroes, such as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League of America</a>.</td></tr><tr><td><h3>Earth-2</h3></td></tr><tr><td>Home to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\">Justice Society of America</a> and the Golden Age heroes.</td></tr><tr><td><h3>Earth-3</h3></td></tr><tr><td>A world where heroes were villains and vice versa.

Notable members are: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warlock/29-7223/\">                     Warlock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magus/29-7336/\">                     Magus</a>. The Technarchy used the Transmode virus to turn living beings into techno-organic beings and then would drain them of their energy, leaving the remains of their prey to be nothing more than statues. Those not drained of their energy became a Phalanx. The virus can be transmitted through skin contact, though some mutants aren't over taken by the virus as quickly. Those infected possess the ability to shapeshift, recover from damage, and directly interface with machines,<br /><br /><h3>Phalanx</h3>Another Techno-Organic race is The Phalanx. The Phalanx is not a race per definition, just the collective name of any being that has been infected with the Technarchy\u2019s Transmode Virus. Those infected with the Transmode virus lose individuality and usually create a hive like mind and have the the desire to contact other techno-organic lifeforms. Phalanxes also have the ability to absorb both organic and inorganic matter.<br /><br /><div><h3>Extremis</h3>This version of the T-O virus rewrites the carriers entire genetic code. It gives the carriers body an upgrade in health, as well as physical and mental attributes. The original extremis gave powers such as firing electricity bolts and breathing fire. Tony Stark would later alter the virus to save his life, in the process it encased his Iron Man within the hollows of his bones and linking his suit to his mind. With the Extremis he can connect to machines all over the world. The one setback he has encountered has been isolationism, a side effect completely opposite to the Transmode Virus.<br /><br /><h3>Apocalypse</h3>Mister Sinister created this strain of the virus to kill Apocalypse, an attempt that failed. Now in Apocalypse's hand he used it to infect Cable when he was only an infant. This versions requires blood contact rather than skin contact to infect someone. The areas that are infected appear as a blue or gray metallic color. They also tend to create protrusions in the infected ares and change form. Infection is quite painful. This version gives normal humans increased attributes such as strength and speed.<br /><br /><h3>Necrosha</h3>Coupled with <a href=\"/eli-bard/29-59642/\">                    Eli Bard</a>'s ability to infect the Techno-organic virus and <a href=\"/selene/29-2176/\">                   Selene</a>'s immensely powerful mystical abilities, mutants around the world have been revived under the thrall of Bard and his Black Queen.&nbsp; The pair have raised a mutant army who auto-repair any injuries sustained and have wreaked havoc on the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">                  X-Men</a>, <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">                 X-Force</a>, the <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">                New Mutants</a>, <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">               Emma Frost</a>, and the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">              Hellfire Club</a>. &nbsp;<br /><p>&nbsp;<br />Notable revived mutants include <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">             Rogue</a>'s foster mother and former <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">           Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a> member <a href=\"/destiny/29-3557/\">            Destiny</a>, fellow ex-Brotherhood member <a href=\"/pyro/29-3554/\">          Pyro</a>, <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">         New Mutants</a> member <a href=\"/cypher/29-14559/\">        Cypher</a>, <a href=\"/warpath/29-2158/\">       Warpath</a>'s ex-lover <a href=\"/risque/29-15551/\">      Risque</a>, the original <a href=\"/thunderbird/29-2174/\">     Thunderbird</a>, former X-Man <a href=\"/banshee/29-9708/\">    Banshee</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">   Hellfire Club</a>'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9es the <a href=\"/hellions/65-3199/\">  Hellions</a>.<br /></p></div>",

Marvel Origins contained a rare card that is still very highly prized today:  Savage Beatdown.</p><p>DC Origins</p><p>=======</p><p>DC Origins was the first set that DC contributed to the VS. System and introduced the Gotham Knights, Arkham Inmates, Teen Titans, League of Assassins, and the Fearsome Five, as well as the small team Deathstroke.  DC Origins introduced the Boost and Loyalty mechanics.</p><p>Web of Spider-Man</p><p>=======</p><p>Web of Spider-Man was the smallest full set to be realeased by Marvel to date and contained the Spider Friends and the Sinister Syndicate, as well as a few \"legacy\" cards from other teams.  It introduced the Evasion mechanic.</p><p>Superman, Man of Steel</p><p>=======</p><p>The Superman set was a near mirror set of Web of Spider-Man, being that it was the smallest DC set to date and contained nearly the same card codes; Web being MSM, and Superman being DSM.  Superman contained Team Superman, Revnge Squad, New Gods, and Darkseid's Elite, and introduced the Cosmic and Invulnerability mechanics.</p><p>Marvel Knights</p><p>=======</p><p>Marvel Knights was the turning point of VS. and when it truly began to pick up popularity.  It contained the Marvel Knights, Underworld, X-Statix, and the Crime Lords, and introduced the Concealed and Hidden Area mechanics.</p><p>Green Lantern Corps</p><p>=======</p><p>The Green Lantern Corps contained the Green Lanterns, Emerald Enemies, Anti-Matter, and Manhunter teams, and introduced the Concealed-Optional, Willpower, and non-character version mechanics.  The non-character version that was most widely seen here was the construct plot twists.</p><p>The Avengers</p><p>=======</p><p>Marvel's largest set since Origins, The Avengers contained The Avengers, Masters of Evil, Thunderbolts, Squadron Supreme, and Kang Council.  It introduced the Leader, Reservist, and labeled team-up mechanics.</p><p>Justice League of America</p><p>=======</p><p>The Justice League of America contained the JLA, JLI, Injustice Gang, and Secret Society, as well as introducing the ever-useful Ally keyword and the first Dual Affiliated characters.</p><p>X-Men</p><p>=======</p><p>X-Men was the first set to controversially feature a team that was already released as the main team.  It contained the X-Men, Brotherhood, Morlocks, and Hellfire Club and introduced the Mutant Traits.</p><p>Infinite Crisis</p><p>=======</p><p>Infinite Crisis was the largest DC set since DC Origins, and contained JSA, Shadowpact, Villains United, Secret Six, Crisis, and Checkmate.  The set introduced many new mechanics, such as Vengeance, Backup, Loyalty-Reveal, Magic plot twists, as well as heavily featured the identity mechanic with the JSA team.</p><p>Heralds of Galactus</p><p>=======</p><p>The Heralds of Galactus set contained the Heralds of Galactus, Kree, Inhumans, and Infinity Watch, as well as revisiting the Doom and Skrull teams.  This set introduced the Terraform, Press, and Cosmic-Surge mechanics, and was perhaps one of the most anticipated sets due to the inclusion of the big purple man himself, Galactus.</p><p>Legion of Superheroes</p><p>=======</p><p>The Legion of Superheroes contained the Legionnaires and Future Foes, as well as revisiting the Teen Titans and Darkseid's Elite.  The set introduced the Substitue keyword, as well as expanded the use of the Cosmic mechanic.</p><p>Marvel Team-Up</p><p>=======</p><p>Marvel Team-Up contained the Marvel Defenders and Wild Pack, as well as revisiting the Spider Friends,  Underworld, and Sinister Syndicate.

There was only one mechanic in this set, and it was Insanity. Insane decks may only contain one copy of every card in the deck. This means that your deck will be made up of sixty or more completely different cards. It also means that you will get the 'insane' bonuses from Insanity cards. You cannot get these bonuses if you have two or more of any card in your deck.</p><p>Marvel Legends</p><p>=======</p><p>Marvel Legends allows you to play as some of your favorite Marvel characters; including Wolverine, Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, Hulk, Dr. Doom, and more. Teams featured in this set are Fantastic Four, Doom, X-Men, Marvel Knights, Brotherhood, and Shi'ar.</p><p>DC Legends</p><p>=======</p><p>DC Legends was similar to Marvel Legends in that it allowed you to design decks centered around popular DC comics characters, such as Superman, Flash, Aquaman, Batman, Joker, and Lex Luthor. It included teams such as the Injustice Gang, Secret Society, JLA, and Teen Titans.</p><p>Banned List</p><p>=======</p><p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"135831\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4744/135831-119325-vs-system_super.jpg\" title=\"First Banned Card\"><img id=\"135831\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4744/135831-119325-vs-system_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"First Banned Card\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">First Banned Card</div></div></div></div>These cards are banned from tournament use and are listed in the order of the dates they were banned.

Sever Upper Deck Entertainment trading card games will use the Vs. System game rules and card backs. As long as you see the Vs. System logo on the card back, the card may be played in any Vs. System deck you create.</p><a></a><h2>Anatomy of a Card</h2><p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"116684\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116684-137121-vs-system_super.JPG\" title=\"Older card style\"><img id=\"116684\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116684-137121-vs-system_thumb.JPG\" alt=\"Older card style\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Older card style</div></div></div></div>There are 4 types of cards in the Marvel Trading Card Game: characters, equipment, locations, and plot twists. All four card types share some common elements:</p><p>Name: The name of the card.</p><p>Recruit Cost: The ammount of resource points required to recruit a character or equipment.</p><p>Version: This line provides a way to distinguish one version of the character from another (ei. Superman and Spider-Man have many character cards.)</p><p>Team Affiliation: Most characters belong to a team. Some have no Team Affiliation. (ei. Avengers, Spider Friends, Team Superman)</p><p>Flight: Appears on characters who can fly. (They can attack the support row.)</p><p>Range: Appears on characters that have long-ranged attacks. (Characters that have guns, or shoot energy beams from their hands or eyes. They can attack from the support row.)</p><p>Attack Value (ATK): Represents the strength and/or fighting ability of a character.</p><p>Defense Value (DEF): Represents the agility and/or toughness of a character.</p><p>Threshold Cost: Locations and plot twists have threshold costs. You can flip a location or play a plot twist if you have at least as many resources in play as the threshold cost of the location or plot twist. (ei. you may play a plot twist with cost 4 or less if you have 4 resources. You do not have to pay resources to flip locations or play plot twists.</p><p>Card Type: Tells whether the card is an equipment, location, or plot twist. Characters have their team affiliation printed in this spot.</p><p>Ongoing: Appears on plot twists to remind players of an ongoing effect. (An effect that lasts until another effect states otherwise.)</p><p>Flavor Text: A quote or character information that has no game effect.</p><p>Collector Number: The first letters describe the set and the last three numbers describe which card in the set it is. \"Sinister Salvo\" is card 026 in the set MSS (Marvel Spider-Man Starter). A white collector number indicates a common card. When the collector number is silver, it indicates an uncommom card. When the number is gold, it indicates a rare card.</p><a></a><h2>Basic Game Concepts</h2><p>Endurance: Each player starts with 50 endurance. At the end of the turn, if you've knocked your opponent's endurance to zero or less, you win! (This is not totally correct. Whoever has the lowest endurance will lose. If player one has -12 endurance, and player 2 has -23 endurance, player one wins.)</p><p>Deck: The starter set contains two decks of fourty cards to help you learn the game. When building your own constructed deck, you must at least 60 cards.</p><p>Hand: You start the game with four cards drawn off the top of your deck. You then decide whether or not to 'mulligan' this hand. This means that you put those four cards on the bottom of your deck in any order if you do not like the cards you got. You can only do this once, and then you draw four more cards. You then start turn one by each player drawing two cards. You will draw two cards every turn at the start of the Draw Phase, unless an effect tells you otherwise.</p><p>Front Row: When you recruit a character, you can put it in your front row or support row. Characters in your front row comprise your main line of attack and defense. Front row characters protect characters behind them in the support row.</p><p>Support Row: This is the row directly behind the front row where you can place characters. If a support row character is protected (there is a front row character directly in front of it) it can only be attacked by a character with flight.</p><p>Resource Row: This is the row closest to you. Each turn, you may put one card from your hand face down into this row as a resource. Any card can be placed face down into the resource row as a resource. However, plot twists and locations have additional game effects when placed in the resource row. Character and equipment cards put into the resource row may not be turned face up. You can look at face down resources you have in play at any time, but you cannot change their order within the row. </p><p>Protected: A front row character that is not stunned protects the support row character directly behind him. Front row characters are never considered protected.</p><p>KO: Short for 'knocked out'. When a card is KO'd, it is placed into its owner's KO'd pile.</p><p>Ready/Exhausted: A card in play is either ready (upright) or exhausted (turned on it's side, face up). To ready an exhausted card, turn the card upright. To exhaust a ready card, turn it on it's side. Cards enter play in the ready state, unless otherwise noted.</p><p>Stunned: When a character is defeated in combat, it becomes stunned and is turned face down in the exhausted state. Stunned characters may not be attacked and cannot use their powers.</p><p>Recover: When a stunned character is recovered, it is turned face up in the exhausted state.</p><p>Activate: Some cards have the keyword Activate. Only ready (upright) cards can activate. To activate a ready card, exhaust it (turn it to it's side).</p><a></a><h2>Characters</h2><p>Character cards represent the heroes and villains that make up the Marvel Universe.</p><p>Recruit Cost: You may recruit a character by spending resource points equal to the character's recruit cost. Recruit cost is the number in the top left hand corner in gold.</p><p>Version: Each character has a version immediately under its name. Some characers have different versions that represent various times in the history of that character. You can have up to four copies of each version in your deck.</p><p>Unique: Most characters are unique. Each player may have only one copy of a named character in play at a time, regardless of the character's version. When you recruit a character, put any other characters you control with the same name into your KO'ed pile. For example, each player could have own copy of Spider-Man in play, but only one copy.</p><p>Army: A few characters have \"Army\" printed in the version area underneath their name. These characters are not unique. Each player can have any number of army characters in play at the same time. These characters represent agents, soldiers, or minions of a larger organization. When building a deck, you can include unlimited copies of army characters.</p><p>Flight: A front row character with flight can bypass an opposing front row character to attack the protected character behind it.</p><p>Range: Characters with range can attack from the support row. A character with both flight and range can make an attack against a protected character, even while in the support row!</p><p>Attack Value: A character's attack value represents the character's ability to fight. The attack value is abbreviated \"ATK\" and is printed in gold next to the lightning bolt icon in the bottom left corner of the card.</p><p>Defense Value: A character's defense value represents the character's resistance to attack. The defense value is abbreviated \"DEF\" and is printed in silver next to the shield icon in the bottom left hand corner of the card.</p><p>Team Affiliation: Most characters are part of a team and can rienforce their fellow teammates and combine with them for team attacks. If no name appears here, the character is not a member of a team.</p><p>Team Symbole: Now on each character is also a Team Symbole, this Symbole will be used as a refrence for this character's team affiliation. Character's without an affiliation do not of a symbole.</p><p>Concealed: There is a moon shape symbole colored in on the character. This means that the character will come into play in the concealed area.</p><p>Visible: The sun is colored in on this character. This means that the character will come into play in the visible area.</p><a></a><h2>Equipment</h2><p>Equipment cards represent gear, weapons, and vehicles that your characters can use. </p><p>Recruit Cost: Just like a character card, you may recruit an equipment card during the recruit step by spending resource points equal to the number of the equipment's recruit cost. (Most equipment have a cost of 0.)</p><p>Equip Restrictions: A character may not be equipped with more than one equipment card at a time. You cannot move the equipment between characters. You may only equip characters that you control.</p><p>KO: When a character is KO'd or removed from play, any equipment attached to the character is placed in it's owner's KO'd pile.</p><p>Unique: A few equipment cards are unique and follow the same rules as unique characters. Look for the word \"unique\" in the text box.</p><a></a><h2>Locations</h2><p>Locations are important places in the Marvel Universe. Locations are put face down in the resource row and may only be flipped face up from the resource row. You may place only one card into the resource row each turn. When you have a face down location in your resource row you may flip it over to make its game text active. Once it's flipped up, it may not be turned face down again.</p><p>Threshold Cost: The silver number in the upper left corner of the card represents the minimum number of resources that must be in your resource row for you to flip the location. Usually, the number is very low, but some powerful cards have a higher threshold cost. </p><p>Using Threshold: Once you've met a location's threshold cost, you may flip it face up at any time. You may flip face up as many locations as you want, as long as you've met each one's threshold cost. You do not have to spend resource points to flip a location.</p><p>Stay in Play: After a location is turned face up, it stays in play and continues to count as a resource every turn. Most locations have powers that can be activated or provide continuing modifiers to the game.</p><p>Unique: Like characters, locations are unique. When you flip a location, place any other location you control with the same name into your KO'd pile.</p><a></a><h2>Plot Twists</h2><p>Plot Twists are surprise situations that affect the game or teh characters within it. Plot twists can be played from your resource row like locations or they can be played directly from your hand. Plot twists are never unique, you may have several copies of the same plot twist in play at the same time.</p><p>Play from Resource Row: You may play a plot twist from your resource row at any time as long as you have a number of resources equal to or greater than the threshold cost of the plot twist. Turn the card face up and follow the instructions on the card. Leave the plot twist in play; it continues to count as a resource, but doesn't do anything else unless it has an ongoing power.</p><p>Stay in Play: Like locations, plot twists stay in play after they are used. Most plot twists provide a one-time modifier, but they remain in play afterword, functioning as a resource. They may not be turned face down.</p><p>Play from Hand: You may also play a plot twist from your hand at any time as long as you have a number of resources in play equal to or greater than the threshold cost of the plot twist. Show the plot twist to the other players and follow the instructions on the card. Then put the plot twist in your KO'd pile instead of your resource row.</p><p>Ongoing: Ongoing plot twists have the ongoing icon and continue to have active powers when they are face up in your resource row. Play an ongoing plot twist as normal following any instructions before the word \"Ongoing.\" Any game text after the word \"ongoing\" starts to work as soon as the plot twist is turned face up and continues to work as long as the plot twist remains face up in your resource row.</p><a></a><h2>Starting the Game</h2><p>Each player will need a way to track his endurance (pen and paper, dice, calculator). At the start of the game, randomly determine which player chooses who has the initiative for the first turn. Flip a coin, roll a die, or play rock-paper-scissors - the winner gets to choose who starts with initiative on turn one. Players shuffle their decks and give their opponent a chance to cut it. Then, each player draws an opening hand of four cards.</p><p>New Hand (Mulligan): If a player is unhappy with his opening hand of four cards, he may immediately place the cards on the bottom of his deck in any order and redraw four new cards. Each player may do this only once per game, only at the start of the game.</p><p>Turns and Initiative: A game of Marvel is played in turns, phases, and steps. During a turn, players can put resources into play, recruit characters, and fight battles. One player will begin the turn with the initiative. That player is able to perform his steps first that turn.</p><p>Initiative Token: When playing the game for the first few times, you should use a token to track which player has the initiative. The token can be anything handy; a coin, a die, or Captain America's shield. At the end of the turn, pass the initiative token clockwise to the next player.</p><p>Object of the game: Each player starts with fifty endurance, which represents the staying power of that player's team of heroes. The object of the game is to reduce your opponent's endurance to zero.</p><p>Special Note: If at any time you run out of cards in your deck you do not lose. You can continue playing; you just no longer draw any new cards.</p><p>The Golden Rule: Whenever a card contradicts a rule in this rulebook, the card is correct.</p><a></a><h2>Turn Sequence</h2><p>Draw Phase: During the draw phase, all players simultaneously draw two cards.</p><p>Build Phase: The player with the initiative performs the three steps below in order. Then the next player completes the three steps in order until each player has completed all three steps of the build phase.</p><p>Resource Step: You may choose any one card from your hand to put into your resource row face down as a resource. Place the card to the right of the last resource you put in into play. (It is no common to place the resource the the left, starting with the first resource next to your deck, and continuing in a line to the left.) Any characters or equipment placed into the resource row may never be turned face up. (The new key word \"reservist\" allows you to recruit characters that have reservist from the resource row.)</p><p>Recruit Step: At the start of your recruit step, each card in your resource row generates one resource point. You can spend resource points to recruit characters and equipment. Any unspent resource points are lost at the end of the recruit step. To recruit a character or equipment, you must spend a number of resource points equal to the card's recruit cost. You can place a newly <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"116685\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system_super.JPG\" title=\"Card Formation\"><img id=\"116685\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116685-17911-vs-system_thumb.JPG\" alt=\"Card Formation\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Card Formation</div></div></div></div>recruited character face up into either your front row or support row. Equipment cards must be attached to a character.</p><p>Formation Step: During the formation step, you can rearrange your characters by moving them into new rows or new positions in your front and support rows. It's important to show which characters are in front of other characters and which characters are beside other characters.</p><a></a><h2>Combat Phase</h2><p>After each player has taken turns completing the build phase, the player with initiative has his attack step. Then each other player has his attack step.<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"116686\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116686-109610-vs-system_super.JPG\" title='\"Ready\" characters and an \"exhausted\" character'><img id=\"116686\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116686-109610-vs-system_thumb.JPG\" alt='\"Ready\" characters and an \"exhausted\" character' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\"Ready\" characters and an \"exhausted\" character</div></div></div></div></p><p>Attack Step: During your attack step, your characters can attack. They attack one at a time.</p><p>Declaring an attack: Choose one of your ready front row characters to be the attacker and an opposing unprotected character to be the defender. An unprotected character is a character in the front row or a defender in the support row with no character in front of it. Exhaust the declared attacker to begin the attack. </p><p>Characters with flight: Normally, a character can only attack an opposing unprotected character. However, characters with flight can fly over a front row character to attack a protected character behind it. (Contrary to beginer belief, characters with flight cannot 'fly' over a front row character and attack a player directly if there are no support row characters.)</p><p>Characters with Range: Normally, support row characters cannot attack. However, a character with range can attack from the support row.</p><p>Characters with Flight and Range: The ultimate combination. A character with flight and range can attack from your support row and into either row.</p><p>Resolving and Attack: </p> <li><p>Compare the attacker's ATK to the defender's DEF. If the attacker's ATK is less than the defender's DEF, nothing happens to the defender. If the attacker's ATK is equal to or higher than the defender's DEF, the defender will be stunned. If the attacker's ATK is greater than the defender's DEF, the defender will be stunned and it's controller will take breakthrough endurance loss equal to the difference.</p> </li> <li><p>Compare the defender's ATK to the attacker's DEF. If the defender's ATK is less than the attacker's DEF, nothing happens to the attacker. If the defender's ATK is equal to or greater than the attacker's DEF, the attacker is stunned.</p> </li><p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"116687\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116687-184124-vs-system_super.JPG\" title=\"Character positions\"><img id=\"116687\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/116687-184124-vs-system_thumb.JPG\" alt=\"Character positions\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Character positions</div></div></div></div>Stunned Characters: When a character is stunned, its controller losed endurance equal to the character's recruit cost. The character is then turned face down in the exhausted state. A stunned character remains in the row and column that it occupies, but no longer protects a support row character immediatly behind it. A stunned character still counts as a character and retains its name, version, and team. A stunned character cannot ready, cannot be attacked, and its game text is inactive. Any player may look at any stunned character at any time. </p><p>Breakthrough Endurance Loss: When an attacker's ATK is greater than a defender's DEF, the defender's controller loses endurance equal to the difference between the values.</p><p>Attacking an Opponent Directly: If an opponent controls no characters or if all of his characters are stunned, you can attack his endurance directly. Declare an attack as normal, but since there is no defender, simply subtract the attacker's ATK from the opposing player's endurance. This is considered breakthrough endurance loss. Your attacks must still be legal in order to make this attack.</p>",

        "description":"<p><b><u>Note</u>: When possible when adding the homage cover concept to a specific issue, add a description of what it is a homage to in the description box on the issue page.</b></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The cover of a comic book is created to draw attention, and it is usually up to the artist to create a striking image to entice the customer to purchase the comic. Sometimes, the cover art on a particular issue becomes so iconic that other cover artists feel that they must pay tribute by making their own version of the image. This is an introduction to many different poses and styles that have been paid homage to over the years.</p><h2>Homage Covers</h2><p>The largest portion of covers that pay homage are usually honouring the work of previous comic book covers. They tend to be direct tributes, although occasionally there are unintentionally alike covers. One should note that there are really only so many interesting poses the human body can make, and it's not out of the question that in some cases what appears to be a tribute may just be a coincidence. Special attention should be drawn to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arthur-suydam/26-23406/\"> Arthur Suydam</a>, who has produced a large back catalog of homage covers with a bizarre yet humorous twist for the various <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/65-15411/\"> Marvel Zombies</a> titles.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1161661\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54850/1161661-x_men136_super.jpg\" title=\"Uncanny X-Men #136\"><img id=\"1161661\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54850/1161661-x_men136_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Uncanny X-Men #136\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Uncanny X-Men #136</div></div></div></div><p><b>Uncanny X-Men #136 &amp; Crisis on Infinite Earths #7: The Extreme Mourning While Carrying A Dead Loved One Pose</b></p><p>A really iconic cover and perhaps the most homaged one of all. Neither <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/49-2133/\"> Uncanny X-Men</a> #136 nor <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths/49-3441/\"> Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> #7 are the first of this kind, there's been countless variations as far back as the 1950's. However, those two issues are listed since they are two of the most recognizable homages. It is probably impossible to determine which was the very first 'carrying a dead loved one' as there's not that many ways to stand with a dead person in your arms. It is debatable that the inspiration is the <i>Piet\u00e0</i> (see 'Fine Art' below), although it is arguable since the post isn't as strong or dynamic.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-child-of-light-and-darkness/37-20613/\"> <b>Uncanny X-Men #136</b></a> <b>(1980)</b> Cover by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-byrne/26-1770/\"> John Byrne</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-beyond-the-silent-night/37-25926/\"> <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths #7</b></a> <b>(1985)</b> Cover by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/george-perez/26-2913/\"> George Perez</a></li></ul><p>It is alleged that the resemblance between the two and any of the ones before is completely unintentional. But there is a small difference between the two. The Crisis-cover shows a gallery of mourning superheroes in the background, so it is quite easy to tell if a cover is a homage to the X-Men or the Crisis-cover.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1161669\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54850/1161669-crisis_on_infinite_7_super.jpg\" title=\"Crisis on Infinite Earths 7\"><img id=\"1161669\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54850/1161669-crisis_on_infinite_7_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Crisis on Infinite Earths 7\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Crisis on Infinite Earths 7</div></div></div></div><p>It has become a popular pose for many different artists, but it has not stopped artists from repeating their own work.

In other instances, the pose has been repeated within the same series, with uses in Uncanny X-Men #167 and the X-Men mini series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-phoenix-endsong/49-11353/\"> Phoenix: Endsong</a>.</p><p>There are other covers that are much more similar which is why it has its own section.

She decided to call this term 'Women in Refrigerators' after a panel in the <a href=\"../../comic/green-lantern/4363/39462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern #54</a> (1994) comic book. The scene in question featured <a href=\"../../kyle-rayner/29-40431/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kyle Rayner</a> returning home to his apartment. There he found a note informing him to look inside the fridge, where he found the mangled remains of his girlfriend, <a href=\"../../alexandra-dewitt/29-41167/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex DeWitt</a>.

        "description":"<p>Though not common, there have been round robins in comics. Before they start their round robin, the people involved have to agree on some guidelines for their round robin \"story.\" These can be, but are not necessarily limited to: amount contributed, plot, characters, style, continuity, goals, what to do about was previously created, time constraints, things not allowed, specific rules, etc. </p> To be more interesting, usually comic round robins have different writers - sometimes the writers are also the artists. Sometimes they have different artists, especially if they want the \"look at all the people involved\" sort of effect. With three or more writers, there is the question of whether a writer somewhere in the middle can only read the last entry (and since they don't have access to the previous entries, the story becomes very \"schizophrenic\") or all the work previously made (making for a more coherent story). It is sometimes the duty for the last writer with the overwhelming task of \"wrapping things up,\" or everyone involved can get together to finish the project, or it can just be left hanging, maybe for someone else to continue. Also everyone is usually given a chance to see, and possibly have a good laugh over, the \"completed\" work.<p>Here are some examples of Round Robins in comics:</p><p>DC Challenge: a 12 part round robin in the DC universe with 12 different writer/artist teams. Each were required to make a cliffhanger for the next team to solve and there was no writer collaboration, except in the last issue, where it was wrapped up.</p><p>3 Word Game (In the Comicvine forum under RPG's): Well, okay this isn't a comic. I put this on to show an example of a round robin, for readers who don't have any round robin comic issues. This is a story where anyone can add three words to it. They have the opportunity to read all the previous entries (whether they do or not...) and to post another 3 words, if they desire. Probably not very cohesive. At least for now, it seems never ending.</p>",

        "description":"<p>The term \"jumping the shark\" came from a Happy Days episode in which <a href=\"/the-fonz/29-62138/\">the Fonz</a>, while water skiing, had to jump over a shark. Many viewers found it illogical to Fonz's character and rather stupid. People were also finding that the quality of the shows after that were in a decline. In order for something to be jumping the shark in any medium, there has to be something specific that happens in the series that watermarks (get it?) the end of that series being good. People are usually forever changed as to their opinions of that series afterwards. It isn't \"jumping the shark\" if the series slowly declines and nobody can put a finger on it as to why it's that way, nor is it if the series has a bad episode, but with good episodes after it, and the bad episode is forgiven.</p> Like any serial medium, comics is rife with opportunity for jumping the shark. Listed are certain ways that a comic series that jumps the shark. These reasons aren't exclusive, sometimes, it's more than one factor which makes the title jump the shark.<p>Artists/writers leaving or introduction of new writers or artists. Sometimes a series has a fantastic team: great writing, great artwork, etc. Then suddenly someone new comes in, and that series is on a one way trip to Sucksburg. Or sometimes there's a team of artists or writers, and someone leaves that team (and nobody replaces them) and it's apparent where the talent was. Within a few issues a comic can go from awesome to so bad, you wonder how the ink stays on the paper.</p><p>A character entering or leaving the series. Since comics are character driven, they are very important to the story. Sometimes changing the formula as to who is in or out of the storyline can be disastrous. Characters can leave the series for many reasons like death or disagreement with other characters. The character leaving can make the comic bad, especially if he is a fan favorite or about the only thing holding the series together. For introducing a character, the character usually has to be nonfitting to the story, irritating or otherwise make the comic unreadable (boring characters introduced are usually just ignored and aren't usually jump the sharkworthy). Sometimes it's not the hero characters, but the villain characters that are bad (not just evil). People want this usually shoehorned in character to die soon and painfully. One of the most famous examples (although this is a cartoon) is Scrappy Doo.</p><p>The plot becomes absurd, silly, stupid, etc. A lot of times, the people behind the comic want to take the comic in a new direction. The problem is it's a bad direction. Or they used their good ideas up first, so now its time for the not so good ideas. Sometimes they paint themselves in corners, and judging from what they're doing, they've been sniffing the fumes. Although there may not be a specific panel that people can draw on and say \"everything before this panel was good, everything after this panel was bad,\" when a story arc is mentioned only in angry or dejected or \"those were the good days and this isn't\" tones, that comic may have jumped the shark.</p><p>They run out of ideas or are treading water. Although closely related to the last paragraph, this deserves special mention. Sometimes it's not the ideas or characters or whatever is what's bad, it's the fact that they're using them over and over again. Long running series can have the been there done that feel to them (though at which point people think it jumps the shark can vary - is it because of this villain introduced for the 8th or 9th time that pushes it over the edge to baddom for that person?). Or the plots are near carbon copies of each other. It's hard to tell, except maybe by later interviews, if the team just liked doing the same thing over and over or they actually ran out of ideas, but were forced to create something.</p><p>Outside influences. Sometimes the creators have good ideas and would continue to make a great comic, but something outside the team is stopping them. One big example would be the publishers. Sometimes the bigwigs in charge want the comic to change. And who better than people who sit in an office all day would know how to make a good comic? Sometimes it's a censorship issue, and the comic had to be toned down; but if the title was over the top, and it had to be brought a few notches down, it's no longer top-notch, is it? Or they think the comic should go in this direction, or should have this new character, or should be part of this big crossover. Sometimes its due to the comic getting a new publisher, and all the problems with it. Sometimes, a comic isn't selling well, but it's still a good comic. So ways of improving sales are thought up at the board meeting. Changes are coerced (\"do this or we're canceling it\"), and instead of having a loyal cult of followers reading it, it has no one. Since outside influences don't affect the comic book directly, it can be hard to pin the jumping the shark blame on them, usually there's a lot of suspicion.</p><p>Cancellation or termination of series. Though, technically not jumping the shark - for there aren't any bad issues after the last issue - it's considered \"bad\" for the reader that the series has ended for whatever reason. If used this way (especially if it was canceled), usually people imply that there could have been more good issues if it would have been allowed to continue.</p><p>And, if the comic was always bad, people say \"it jumped the shark from the beginning.\" Again, technically not jumping the shark, for when something jumps the shark, it goes from good to bad, but a bad title from its start to its (hopefully soon) finish, goes from bad to good, that is, its cancellation is the best thing that ever happened to it.</p>",

Many factors are taken into account when grading. Condition of staples, inks, whiteness of cover and pages, clarity and gloss of cover, writing/tape/other damage, staining, rips, water damage/soiling, and any other conceivable type of damage or wear are taken into account when grading is done.</p><p>A major drawback to comic book grading is that there is a fairly well-used convention that is highly misunderstood and misused by casual collectors (or non-collectors). This is generally due to simple ignorance or neglect rather than malicious intent, but remaining vigilant is always advisable especially when your hard-earned cash is at stake. Some common instances of misusing comic terminology include words such as \"Good\", \"Fine\", and \"Very Good\", each of which have very specific meanings and connotations to someone who is familiar to the comic book grading scale when used to describe the overall condition of a book. Conversely, words such as \"Excallent\" and \"Great\" carry very little meaning when describing an overall book, but may successfully be used to describe very specific aspects of a book. \"Mint\" is perhaps the worst term of all, being the most misused and misunderstood of all the concepts used in comic book grading (as well as the grading of a variety of other collectables). Understanding the grading scale will help one correctly describe the condition of their books, and to understand specifically what others mean when describing the conditions of their books or the overall grade of a particular book.</p><p>This guide is by no means intended to be the be-all end-all source for comic book grading information. Rather, it is intended to be a starting point for anyone who has little to no experience in comic book grading and as a point of reference for comic fans new and old. Anyone who is serious about learning the intricacies of the art of comic book grading is highly recommended to purchase a good book on the subject (For more information see \"Overstreet\"). Otherwise, your local comic book store is also a great starting point, and can usually be a great place for advice on all things comics.</p><a></a><h2>Grading Scale</h2><p>While there is some small degree of variation on the following grading scheme within the community, the following is a representative of the general consensus on the comic book grading scale.</p>10.0Gemstone/MintGM<div>9.9Mint/MT</div><div>9.8Near Mint/MintNM/MT</div><div>9.6Near Mint NM </div><div>9.4Near MintNM</div><div>9.2Near Mint-NM-</div><div>9.0Very Fine/Near MintVF/NM</div><div>8.5Very Fine VF </div><div>8.0Very FineVF</div><div>7.5Very Fine-VF-</div><div>7.0Fine/Very FineFN/VF</div><div>6.5Fine FN </div><div>6.0FineFN</div><div>5.5Fine-FN-</div><div>5.0Very Good/FineVG/FN</div><div>4.5Very Good VG </div><div>4.0Very GoodVG</div><div>3.5Very Good-VG-</div><div>3.0Good/Very GoodGD/VG</div><div>2.5Good GD </div><div>2.0GoodGD</div><div>1.8Good-GD-</div><div>1.5Fair/GoodFR/GD</div><div>1.0FairFR</div><div>0.5PoorPR<p>Gemstone Mint - Flawless in every way. Can be considered a \"perfect\" copy. Gem mint books occur very rarely, and are extremely rare to non-existant in older books. Gemstone Mint books are the highest grade possible. Some graders will never give a grade of a perfect 10 because they feel that there are no books which have absolutely no visible damage. In some grading schemes there is no Gem mint distinction, meaning that any book that is graded as 9.9-10.0 is Mint.</p><p>Mint - Book is virtually flawless. Cover and pages are supple and white without fading. No creases, folds, stains, etc are tolerated. Corners are sharp and edges are cut properly. Staples show no signs of wear and spine has no visible damage. In other words, a book that earns the grade \"Mint\" is virtually perfect in every way, but for some reason does not earn a perfect 10. This grade is one of the most heavily abused by those that don't understand comic book grading, and assume a book is flawless without any actual investigation.</p><p>Poor - The worst possible grade that can be given to a comic book. Damage/Wear to a Poor book is so excessive that the book holds little or no actual monetary value. A book with a Poor grade may have excessive writing, staining, fading, loose or missing pages, missing cover, excessive signs of amateur repair (such as tape damage), severely brittle pages or cover, excessive tearing, flecking, etc. Poor books with little damage (particularly important issues) may still be collectable for reading or for repair of other books.</p><a></a><h2>Grading Terms and Concepts</h2><p>When grading there are a number of things to look for, and several terms worth noting when understanding grading of comics and other periodicals.</p><p>Browning/Tanning - Covers and pages can become stained over years of mis-care which can result in whites becoming tanned or browned typically by oxidation, smoke, or other soiling. Browning is worse than tanning.</p><p>Dent - Damage that occurs to a book when sharp pressure is exerted. Generally causes structural damage or damage to ink.</p><p>Dullness - Lack of light reflectivity of the cover of a book. This is detrimental to the grade of a book.</p><p>Chipping - Small pieces of a cover or page being removed, typically smaller than about a millimeter.</p><p>Clipping - Wear that occurs on the edge of a book when typically resulting in chipping or creasing.</p><p>Corner Rounding/Blunting - Rounded corners generally occur over time as the corner of a book is damaged. This can occur on any corner.</p><p>Crease/Creasing - Permanent folding, generally where color/structure is damaged resulting in a line.</p><p>Edge Wear - Damage to the sides of a comic book.</p><p>Fold/Folding - Permanent fold in pages or cover which doesn't result in color/structural damage.</p><p>Foxing - Small orange or brown discoloration on a cover or pages.</p><p>Gloss - Light reflectivity of the cover of a book. High reflectivity is prized, especially among older and higher grade books.</p><p>Heavy Crease/Heavy Creasing - Long creases, typically longer than 2 inches.</p><p>Investment Copy - Investment copy typically does not denote a specific grade of book, but is used to generalize books whose quality is good enough to expect some future gain in value.</p><p>Joined Pages - Pages that are not cut apart, resulting from a trimming error.</p><p>Light Crease/Light Creasing - Creases smaller than 2 inches.</p><p>Migration - Staining that occurs when rust damage on staples moves onto the cover and/or pages.</p><p>Mildew/Mold - Fungal damage caused by exposure to excess moisture.</p><p>Missing Pieces - May occur when pieces are ripped or torn from age and normal wear. Also includes ads or other pieces literally being cut out, can be as large as entire pages or cover missing.</p><p>Fading - Fading and other discoloration can occur when a book is exposed to outside factors such as sunlight.</p><p>Fanning/Fanned Pages - Generally caused by spine-roll when pages of comic are fanned out as to be uneven.</p><p>Filed Staples - Filing staples is a restoration technique where rust and discoloration is filed off of the staple, making the staples appear to be in better condition than they are. This can be detected under magnification.</p><p>Fleck/Flecking/Color Fleck - A fleck is a small piece of color that has been flaked off a cover, typically smaller than about a millimeter.</p><p>Pedigree - Sometimes a collection will surface (of a variety of sizes) where books are all in exceptional condition and worthy of particularly high grades that are worthy of being recognized for the collection they came from. Some grading services will recognize pedigree books in the grading. Few collections are recognized as pedigree, but are generally large, are comprised of vintage books, and were purchased by the original owner.</p><p>Pressing - Perhaps the most common type of comic book repair/restoration, pressing is the act of applying pressure (and sometimes heat) to a book to flatten it out and improve its appearance. Pressing often occurs in the home, but professional services do exist with specialized machinery to press comics.</p><p>Printing Errors - Where some other forms of printing (such as postage stamps which are controlled more carefully) may yield valuable or collectable pieces when printing errors occur, errors in printing comic books generally are not collectable. This may include off-center stapling, staples not going through all pages, folding errors, mis-printed pages, covers or pages being stapled upside-down, cutting errors where cover or pages are not even, and other similar factory errors. Such errors will also yield a lower grade.</p><p>Reading Copy - Reading copy typically does not denote a specific grade of book, but is used to generalize lower quality (and lower value books). Reading Copy books are worn/damaged enough that they do not make good investments but are still good enough to read.</p><p>Repair/Restoration - Ranges from amateur to professional, books may be \"repaired\" with tape, replacement pages/staples, fixing damages in colors/tears, replacing missing chunks, etc. Sometimes Repair is used to describe improper or amateur work, while Restoration is used to describe more professional work.</p><p>Retouch/Color Touch/Color Touch-Up - Repair done to color flecks by using a replacement ink in the damaged area.</p><p>Rusted Staples - Staples (particularly in older comics) are prone to rust when exposed to too much moisture or humidity. This may also cause rust staining of the cover and pages around the staples.</p><p>Scraped Staple - Repair to rusted or discolored staples by scraping off oxidized or damaged exterior layer.</p><p>Shadow - When a portion of a book is covered by other books or other items an exposed portion may become faded or discolored from being exposed to moisture, sun, etc. that the rest of the book is not exposed to.</p><p>Smoke Damage - Tanning/Browning caused by exposure to cigarette smoke.</p><p>Smudge/Smudging - Finger oil or other soiling generally caused by rubbing with fingers.</p><p>Soiling/Staining - Staining damage to a comic by dirt, dust, or other contaminants.</p><p>Spine - Edge of a comic book created when book is stapled and folded.</p><p>Spine Roll - Caused by improper storage, comics will begin to roll up so that the staples face upward when the book is on a flat surface. In extreme cases the spine will curl over.</p><p>Spine Wear - Creasing and other damage occurring on the spine of the comic.</p><p>Stamps/Ink/Pencil Damage - Older books (particularly those sold at newsstands) may have been stamped with a date or logo that was not a part of the original publication. Also includes damage from writing by pens or pencils.</p><p>Staple Wear/Pull - Staples may cause damage in older books wear the paper or cover around the staple is creased or torn, and in extreme cases the staple is pulled through part of the book (cover and possibly pages).</p><p>Stress Lines - Damage to the spine, particularly around the staples caused by stress to the cover.</p><p>Subscription Fold/Subscription Crease - Fold or crease down the center of a book commonly caused by folding during postal delivery of a book. Because of the damage to the color a subscription crease is worse than a subscription fold.</p><p>Tape - Considered by many to be an amateur restoration, older books may have tears or loose pages repaired by scotch tape. Removal of tape can cause tape stain or residue.</p><p>Trimming - Uneven edges of a book being cut to even up uneven pages/cover or repairing damage to the edge.</p><p>Water Damage/Oil Staining - The paper used in comic books (particularly older comics) is prone to staining contact with liquids. This may be caused by exposure to water (or other liquids), oils, any of which can stain the page by altering its color and doing structural damage to the paper. Bad oil stains may cause paper to become translucent.</p><p>Whiteness - Used to gauge the opposite of Tanning/Browning. The amount of whiteness of cover and pages.</p><a></a><h2>Authentication</h2> <p>Several companies exist that will offer comic grading services. Some of those also store comics in archival-quality storage cases to prevent deterioration of or damage to books.</p><p>Prominent Authentication Services</p><p><a href=\"http://www.cgccomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGC</a> - Grades comic books and encapsulates them in a hard archival quality capsule. Labels are enclosed with the book to identify features and remarks on the condition of the book including the Volume name, issue number, publisher, important writers and artists, page color, numerical grade, and any other remarks about the issue. Special tag colors are available for restored books, signed books (when signed under the supervision of a CGC employee), or books with serious defects.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.pgxcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PGX</a> - Offers grading and encapsulation in a hard archival quality capsule. Label is inclosed with the Volume name, issue number, page color, numerical and grade name, and any other remarks on book quality. Remarks are made on the tag about the location of creator signatures, but PGX does not verify signature authenticity.</p><p>Books sealed and authenticated by such companies often command a greater value on the market. There are many reasons for this which include the trustworthiness of the grade, any major defects or restorations being noted, and (least importantly) the inherent value of the grading service and the protective case itself.</p><a></a><h2>Repair/Restoration</h2><p>There are mixed feelings in the comic book industry about the repair or restoration of comic books, and what it does to the value of the book. Generally only used on older books, repairs or restorations can range from rips in pages or covers taped back together, to professional quality restoration of paper, inks and colors, staples, and covers. Restorations may also include using pieces of multiple comic books of a similar era to piece back a book (such as the staples of one book) or to fix torn areas of books. Impact on the value of a book depends on many factors, but a book with significant damage that is old, rare, expensive, and highly sought after may fetch a higher value on the open market after quality, professional restoration than with damage present. Most professional authentication services will do very close and detailed inspection searching for signs of repair. While this may not effect the grade of a book significantly by such services, the remarks on the extent, quality, and area of repair are generally noted on the certification by the company.</p><p>While there is no industry consensus on Restoration of comic books, purchasing restored books is a matter of personal preference.</p><a></a><h2>Signatures</h2><p>As with repair of older comics, there is no accepted standard of what signed books will value at rather than unsigned books. Books with little significance may be relatively unaffected by the existence of a signature. Value of a book with some significance, by a person of some significance may add to the value of a book. Signatures typically do not have much (if any) effect on comic book grades as long as the signature did not cause any damage to the book. Signatures and messages generally occur on the cover of a book, but occasionally occur within the book, particularly on the first page or the inside of the cover. Some creators will take great care to sign in an area that does not obscure a particular portion of the cover (such as the artwork or title), while some generally sign in those areas, and some will sign most anywhere on the cover. Most creators will otherwise still sign where requested by the collector.</p><p>Another common practice is to have one of the contributing artist of a book do a sketch (generally accompanying the signature) on the book. These also vary with respect to size and quality. Occasionally (although rarely), publishers will even put out variant covers of comic books with blank areas designed specifically for this sort of customization. Again, this typically will not effect grading of a comic book. Value of books with sketches vary in a similar manner as signed books, and value for either will depend on the creator's contribution to the book, the creator's contribution to the comic book industry (and to a large degree their popularity), location, and quality. There is a small number within the comic book community that sees either signatures or sketches on comic books by creators as a detriment, and will factor this into grade or value. The general consensus is that neither is bad in their own right.</p><a></a><h2>The Overstreet</h2> <p>The Overstreet (short for Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide and Overstreet Comic Book Grading Guide) is one of the largest and most trusted names in comic book grading and appraisal. Gemstone Publishing releases periodically updated copies of their guides. The Price Guide, currently in its 37th release, features information on the ten point comic book grading scale, as well as approximate values of thousands of American comic books with different values for the different grades of each. The Grading Guide features a much more detailed guide to learning the 10 point grading scale with full color photograph examples of every major defect available, as well as information on grading books from different <a href=\"/history-of-comics/12-42667/\">History of Comics</a>, a suggested restoration scale, and a variety of other information. The Overstreet is available in softbound, hardbound, and ring-bound formats, and past issues of the Overstreet have gained some collectors value themselves (and values of previous editions are listed in the book).</p><p>Overstreet is certainly not the only guide available for comic pricing or grading, however it is one of the most prominent and well respected publications available on the subjects. For those serious in grading and appraisal, Overstreet is a great place to start.</p><p>More information can be found on Gemstone Publishing's website at: <a href=\"http://www.gemstonepub.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.gemstonepub.com</a></p><p>Other appraisal sources exist, including online sources such as ComicsPriceGuide.com, a website which has detailed values of a variety of comic books from various countries including values in various conditions with CGC certification. For anyone that does not want to sink the money into a copy of the Overstreet Comic Price Guide, ComicsPriceGuide.com can be a useful resource when trying to decide whether you should bid on that online auction, or approximately how much you should expect your own books to be worth.</p><p>More information can be found at: <a href=\"http://www.comicspriceguide.com/default.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.comicspriceguide.com/default.asp</a></p><a></a><h2>Precaution</h2><p>It is the hope of the author(s) of this page that since you have read over this material you will have a rudimentary but working knowledge of comic book grading and appraisal. Before investigating the topic further, precaution is still advisable when trying to describe books, particularly those you intend to sell. Likewise, just because you understand the basics of comic book grading does not mean that everyone else does (or intends to use them correctly). Also, while there is a fairly detailed standard of comic book grading that is commonly used, grading is difficult to do well and consistently. A NM from one grader or grading company may be only given a \"VF\" by another, a sizable difference in both approximate condition and value. When entering into a transaction remember to always supply detailed pictures so that along with your description a potential buyer can make their own judgement on specific flaws, damage, and strong features of a book. Likewise, when attempting to purchase a book (particularly in an online environment, and unless the source is trustworthy) you should obtain detailed pictures of any flaws or damage to form your own opinion before making a commitment.</p></div>",

        "description":"<h2>Introduction</h2><p>Comic book storage is an important part of collecting. Proper storage can mean the difference between protecting your investment, or destroying it. We store to keep our comics fresh, clean, crisp, and vibrant. The three key ingredients to proper storage are: bags, boards, and boxes. There are a number of online retailers for various comic supplies, and any of them can also be purchased at your local comic book store. Following proper storage guidelines will ensure the preservation of your comics condition, ensuring a higher <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/comic-book-grading/12-44517/\">Comic Book Grading</a> and retaining book value. This guide is intended for anyone who is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starting-a-comic-book-collection/46747/\">interested in comic book collecting</a>, or has just started collecting and desires a better way to protect the books you have in stacks around your bedroom. It is also important to remember that it is never too late to start taking better care of your books. Neglect and a bad environment can causes damage, but proper care and storage can often prevent further damage from occurring.</p><h2>Bags</h2><p>Environmental contaminants such as dirt, oils, dust, and excessive moisture can not only devalue your comics by causing excess wear and damage, but may also lead to deterioration of your books. Also, unbagged comics may become scuffed easier. Bags should be made of either polyethylene, polypropylene, or mylar (polyester). All three are archival quality materials, meaning that they are formulated without acids or other harmful chemicals which will lead to the deterioration of your books. Mylar is commonly thought of as being the best choice of the three because it lasts the longest, and provides extra support, however many collectors elect to use one of the other two choices because of Mylar's higher price tag. Bags come in a variety of sizes (and thicknesses), so it is important to make sure that whatever you are buying will fit your books properly. The most common sizes are Modern, Regular, Silver, and Golden age. Most comics since the 1980's will fit in Modern size bags, so Modern bags will fit most books produced today.</p><p>Bags are designed with a long flap at the top which is to be folded over and taped down (most use simple scotch tape). This is important because you will not risk the tape making contact with your books. Self-adhesive bags are also available at a slightly higher cost. While some collectors prefer self-adhesive bags for their ease of use and convenience, others will avoid them because repeated taking out and returning of books makes it easier to get the adhesive flap stuck to your books. Bags are also available in a 3-ring binder version which will allow 3-ring binder storage of comics.</p><h2>Boards</h2><p>Boards provide extra structural support to your Bagged comic books. You will only want to purchase acid-free boards to store your comics to avoid contamination. Boards are inserted into comic bags behind the comic, with the back of the comic to the board. As with bags the grades of boards can vary. What is most important is purchasing archival safe boards (again, there are degrees to this too) ensuring proper care of books for the duration of their storage. Comic book boards have two sides to them: one side is rough and matte, the other side is smooth and glossy. Since boards are only intended to protect one comic, only one side is treated, this is the smooth side of the board.</p><h2>Boxes</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"132109\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care_super.jpg\" title=\"caption\"><img id=\"132109\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/132109-56480-comic-book-care_medium.jpg\" alt=\"caption\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">caption</div></div></div></div><p>Boxes can also be an important measure to protect your books from environmental contaminants, sunlight (which can cause damage to the covers of your books), and will preserve the edges and corners of your comics. Boxes are also important because comics prefer to be stored upright rather than being laid flat or stacked, and boxes allow this to be done more easily. There are a variety of styles of Boxes, but here we will only be looking at the most common. Long Boxes and Short Boxes are the most common. A traditional Long Box will store around 300 books depending on what kind and how tightly packed they are. Short boxes only store around 100 books, but some collectors find them better suited to their needs because they are smaller (meaning easier store), and the reduced number of books makes them drastically lighter than a full long box. Another option is pull-out drawer boxes. Boxes with pull out drawers are designed exactly how they sound which can make them much more convenient for comic storage. Boxes are often stored stacked on top of one another, and enough boxes can make reaching those bottom boxes quite an ordeal each week. Boxes with pull-out drawers can be stacked and accessed at any time without having to constantly unstack or rearrange. Dividers can also be purchased for boxes (or may come with them). Dividers are not necessary for the care or protection of your boxes, but may improve access to comics.</p><p>As with Bags and Boards, boxes come in a variety of materials including cardboard, plastic, and wood or metal. Most collectors will opt to use traditional acid-free cardboard boxes because they are inexpensive, safe, and stackable. Long boxes, short boxes, and pull out drawer boxes all come in cardboard designs which can be assembled without any adhesives. Some collectors will purchase archive safe plastic boxes, and occasionally collectors with larger allowances for their comic habit will use wooden or metal cases (which can be purchased or built in a variety of styles).</p><h2>Hard Shells</h2><p>Sometimes a collector desires more than just the simple bagging and boarding. A variety of shapes and styles of comic storage devices exist on the market to give a much more rigid protective shell for comics. The main designs of such are clam-shell or slip over. Hard shells for storage can become very costly, and therefore is not something that most collectors opt to do. Some, however, will purchase special storage for their prized books: sketched or autographed copies as well as older or more valuable books. Again, you should use your discretion and make a choice here that fits your interest and budget. Also, it is still important to seek out cases that are acid and contaminant free so that your means of protecting your books do not actually destroy your books.</p><h2>Authentication Services</h2><p>Several companies exist that will offer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/comic-book-grading/12-44517/\">Comic Book Grading</a> services. The most prominent of those will also store comics in archival-quality storage cases to prevent deterioration of or damage to books. Two of the most common are <a href=\"http://www.cgccomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">CGC</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pgxcomics.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">PGX</a>. The capsules used by both companies to encase comic books not only include information about the comic and its grade, but will also enclose your comic in a rigid, contaminant free exterior which rivals the best cases that one can buy one their own. One of the main drawbacks to this is the price-tag. Because of the high price tag involved this is not a good method for general storage, but can be an excellent way to offer some of the best protection to your most valuable and important books. It is worth noting that while encased for their protection, comics in these cases can still be damaged if not properly cared for. Also, these cases are designed to be tamper-evident so comics that are encased in such capsules cannot be read and the shell must be broken to remove them. This is so that the grade given and the book cannot be altered after you get your book back. These cases are also much larger than traditional comics, and require special boxes to store them.</p><h2>Repair</h2><p>If you have particularly old and valuable comics that have sustained damage or wear over the years, repair options do exist. This remains a controversial topic in the comic book community: Should I repair, or is it best to leave a book alone. Proponents of comic book repair see repairing or restoring a book as bringing it closer to its original condition, and therefore bringing it back to the way that it should be. Those who are against comic book repair often see it as deceitful, making a book appear to be something other than what it is and artificially inflating its value. While much debate exists in this area, proper restoration of a comic book can raise both its grade as well as its approximate value under the right circumstances. Some common repairs are:</p><p>Pressing - Pressing a comic is the act of putting it under large amounts of pressure (and sometimes heat) in order to flatten it out. This can raise the value of an older book; sometimes by thousands. Pressing can be as simple as leaving a book under a stack of dictionaries, and there are even professional pressing services that use special machinery to apply both heat and pressure to a book.</p><p>Staple Repair - Rusted staples may be filed down and smoothed to remove oxidation and discoloration. If this is done well it is only evident under magnification. Staples may be re-folded and re-attached to books when they come loose, and the paper of the book may be tucked under and inside the staple.</p><p>One's stance on repair or restoration is simply a personal choice, but it is good to understand both sides of the issue before one decides to go ahead and have books restored (or attempting to do it on your own).</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>One particularly easy aspect of comic book care, preservation, and handling that is easy to overlook is personal hygiene. It is important to have clean, dry hands when working with your comics. Dirt, oils, dust, and other contaminants can damage comic books. This is especially true when dealing with older comics. Acid in particular has been mentioned several times throughout this article because the papers comic books are printed on (particularly older comics) can be highly susceptible to damage from acid, and will deteriorate much more quickly in its presence. Smokers should be particularly careful because the chemicals in cigarette and cigar smoke will also destroy your books. Keep your books away from sunlight and florescent light. Sun and florescent light will damage book covers causing them to lose color vibrancy and gloss. Comic books also prefer to be stored in a cool, dry place. Heat and moisture (including humidity) can cause a variety of damage to books including mold, mildew, water staining and wrinkling of paper. Also, because of inferior papers and inks older comics are much more susceptible to just about all forms of damage than those produced to day. This is particularly true of books that are already damaged with age and wear.</p>",

Not only do they talk to the reader, but they (usually) know that they are fictional creations in a story. On occasion, this may be a vehicle for dramatic irony. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a>, the most well known example of this phenomenon, has been known to refer to his own history in issue format, lean on the panel borders, and see or touch his thought boxes and word balloons.</p><p>The fourth wall can also be reinforced by a character saying that, i.e., 'this isn't a movie, you know'.</p><h2>Characters</h2><p>Here are some characters that have broken the Fourth Wall:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alex-luthor/29-24087/\">Alex Luthor</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alex-luthor/29-24087/\">Ambush Bug</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/animal-man/29-22707/\">Animal Man</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bat-mite/29-23170/\">AO Major</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bat-mite/29-23170/\">Bat-Mite</a></li><li><a href=\"/bomb-queen/29-40609/\">Bomb Queen</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bat-mite/29-23170/\">Canis</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebus/29-24391/\">Cerebus</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon/29-7367/\">Demon</a></li><li><a href=\"/fig-keele/29-56001/\">Fig Keele</a></li><li><a href=\"/forbush-man/29-6808/\">Forbush Man</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gabreality/29-42151/\">Gabreality</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gary-the-pathetic-fallacy/29-19546/\">Gary, the Pathetic Fallacy</a></li><li><a href=\"/go-go-fiasco/29-12287/\">Go-Go Fiasco</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grifter/29-23624/\">Grifter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-intern/29-46429/\">The Intern</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-horner/29-5955/\">Jack Horner</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jamie-braddock/29-4270/\">Jamie Braddock</a></li><li><a href=\"/john-constantine/29-3329/\">John Constantine</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-lynch/29-4589/\">John Lynch</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joker/29-1702/\">The Joker</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lobo/29-6578/\">Lobo</a></li><li><a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-mxyzptlk/29-27436/\">Mr. Mxyzptlk</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-revise/29-61698/\">Mr. Revise</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-stranger/29-3298/\">Phantom Stranger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purple-man/29-3227/\">Purple Man</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/squirrel-girl/29-2488/\">Squirrel Girl</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starman/29-7646/\">Starman</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy Prime</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/t-ray/29-19994/\">T-Ray</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-killer/29-40808/\">The Killer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watcher/29-7120/\">Uatu the Watcher</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zatanna/29-5691/\">Zatanna</a></li></ul><p>(Note: Characters may have broken the 4th wall at one point in time, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they currently retain the knowledge of the world beyond the comic they are in.)</p><h2>Creators</h2><p><i>Note: This list does not include creators who are in (auto)biographical comics as these stories are about the creators and set in the real world, not in a fictional one. Also, homages to creators or \"easter egg\" appearances do not count, the characters have to explicitly make clear they are breaking the fourth wall.</i></p><p>Some writers break the fourth wall by inserting themselves into the story, wherein their character admits to writing the story they are appearing in:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-moore/26-40382/\">Alan Moore</a> as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-moore/29-72460/\">Alan Moore</a>: Wrote himself into Promethea when \"the world was ending\" and our realities were converging, he is seen writing the script for the page he appears on.</li><li><a href=\"/ben-templesmith/26-41105/\">Ben Templesmith</a> as <a href=\"/ben-templesmith/29-73450/\">Ben Templesmith</a>: He claims to be the biographer for Wormwood, Wormwood writes him off as some loon but Templesmith gets irate claiming he's had Eisner nominations three years in a row now, yeah, whatever.</li><li><a href=\"/brian-k-vaughan/26-40448/\">Brian K. Vaughan</a> as <a href=\"/brian-k-vaughan/29-79942/\">Brian K. Vaughan</a>: Written into Ex Machina as the writer of the comic that will follow the life of Mayor Hundred, shares some of his own personal stories and feelings about New York City and 9/11. Y: The Last Man is also referenced where he clears up that the Daughters of the Amazon are asexual not lesbians. Ironically, he criticizes the use of inserting oneself into the story, mentioning Grant Morrison and saying that it's too \"meta\" and takes him out of the story.</li><li><a href=\"/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> as <a href=\"/the-writer/29-46248/\">The Writer</a>: Perhaps the most well-known example, Grant Morrison inserted himself into the end of his Animal Man run (which was already full of instances where the Fourth Wall was broken) and he explains everything to Animal Man, why he killed his family, what his views are, etc. He mentions that he's also writing Doom Patrol and in the end \"restores\" everything to the status quo.</li><li><a href=\"/jh-williams-iii/26-9316/\">J.H. Williams III</a> as <a href=\"/jh-williams-iii/29-7682/\">J.H. Williams III</a>: Written into Promethea, alongside Alan Moore (see above); is seen drawing the two-page spread he appears in.</li><li><a href=\"/jonathan-ames/26-11217/\">Jonathan Ames</a> as <a href=\"/jonathan-a/29-24158/\">Jonathan A.</a>: Protagonist of The Alcholic. Although this is something of a unique situation, being that the comic is semi-autobiographical, the comic is not meant to be taken as a factual detailing of the writer's life and has fiction inserted, however, the character does talk directly to the reader at points. Although he is more of a character then a creator writing himself into a comic, he is placed in this list due to the fact that his name and life are based on his creator.</li><li><a href=\"/peter-milligan/26-41484/\">Peter Milligan</a> as <a href=\"/miles-laimling/29-69370/\">Miles Laimling</a>: \"Laimling\" being an anagram of \"Milligan\". He is originally just some guy writing \"The Great American Novel\" in Hotel Shade and stealing the identities of Shade, Lenny and Kathy as he writes them. Eventually he breaks the Fourth Wall entirely when he says he's going to write their adventures as a comic and looks at the reader.</li><li><a href=\"/tony-harris/26-4485/\">Tony Harris</a> as <a href=\"/tony-harris/29-79941/\">Tony Harris</a>: Appeared with Brian K. Vaughan (see above), he is portrayed as the \"cooler\" of the two and brings his art portfolio to show off to Mayor Hundred's staff. While Vaughan talks with Hundred, Harris hangs out with January and other staff and draws Bradbury in a \"badass-style\" pose.</li></ul><p>Other creators have also appeared in comics, although were inserted by someone else, rather then doing it themselves:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/karen-berger/26-43437/\">Karen Berger</a> as <a href=\"/karen-berger/29-65580/\">Karen Berger</a>: Inserted into House of Mystery #292 (her first book edited at DC) as the editor to replace Len Wein (see below). Cain seems to warm to her quickly.</li><li><a href=\"/len-wein/26-41457/\">Len Wein</a> as <a href=\"/len-wein/29-32778/\">Len Wein</a>: Apparently Cain doesn't think he's a very good editor.</li></ul><h2>Fifth Wall</h2><p>When characters break the \"Fifth Wall,\" it shows they have knowledge of other fictional characters from another, unrelated actuality.</p><h3>Examples:</h3><p>in The Amazing Spider-Man #123, after being hit through a window by Spider-Man, Luke Cage says \"I dig, Spider-Man ... but here's something you don't! Some dudes have to do this number for a livin' -- we ain't all rich playboys like Bruce Wayne.\" Note that Luke Cage should probably not know of Bruce Wayne, and vice versa.</p><p>In Superman vol. 2 #50, Mr. Mxyzptlk makes several statements hinting that he is also the <a href=\"/impossible-man/29-7590/\">Impossible Man</a> from Marvel Comics and has knowledge of the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, such as \"Having fun with my new fantastic friends,\" \"back to my four new friends,\" It's blubbering time,\" and \"Sometimes it's just impossible to remember what I look like from world to world.\"</p><h2>Recap Pages</h2><p>Some comics have recap pages before the actual story in which characters from that issue (or sometimes the previous one) show up and talk to the reader, breaking the Fourth Wall. These instances are generally isolated and after the recap page, the characters no longer have the ability to break the Fourth Wall. For examples of this, check out the Cable/Deadpool and Irredeemable Antman series.</p><p>Likewise in pages outside of the story, usually at the back of the comic in distinctly separate areas, characters will often address the reader for promotional purposes or for humorous effect.</p>",
        "deck":"A literary term often utilized in theater to describe the imaginary barrier between the actors and audience, separating real world and fantasy. Breaking the fourth wall is observed sometimes in literature, where a character directly addresses the reader.",

Their most notable creation was the Joker's sidekick <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/harley-quinn/29-1696/\">   Harley Quinn</a>. Here are a few more notable entries some of which made it into the mainstream DCU:</p>1. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/renee-montoya/29-3716/\">   Renee Montoya</a> (A detective introduced in B:TAS that is now in the DCU)&nbsp; <br />2. Nora Fries (Mr. Freeze's wife introduced in B:TAS and incorporated into the DCU)&nbsp; <br />3. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/livewire/29-4678/\">   Livewire</a> (A Superman villain introduced in S:TAS and brought into the DCU)&nbsp; <br />4. <a href=\"/phantasm/29-12506/\">  The Phantasm</a> (A villains introduced in B:MotP roughly based on the Reaper from [[Batman: Year Two:char:42225]])&nbsp; <br />5. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terry-mcginnis/29-40501/\">   Terry McGinnis</a> (The future Batman introduced in Batman Beyond and has since appeared in Batman/Superman and Countdown.)&nbsp; <br />6. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warhawk/29-4685/\">   Warhawk</a> (The future son of<a href=\"/john-stewart/29-10451/\">    John Stewart</a> and <a href=\"/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">   Hawkgirl </a>introduced in Batman Beyond)&nbsp; <br />7. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gray-ghost/29-45102/\">   Gray Ghost</a> (The hero of a young Bruce Wayne shown in B:TAS)&nbsp;<br />Production  <p><a href=\"/bruce-timm/26-7365/\">   Bruce Timm</a> was given the job of turning the popular comic book adventure into an animated series. Timm took the series in a more contemporary direction to that of the previous incarnations like the Super Friends. Leaving the sidekicks and pets behind Timm had two main aims when he was making the series, to pay homage to the original line up of the <a href=\"/justice-league/65-55928/\">   Justice League</a> ( <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">   Superman</a>, <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">   Batman</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">   Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">   Aquaman</a>, <a href=\"/green-lantern/12-41148/\">   Green Lantern</a> (<a href=\"/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">  Kyle Rayner</a>), <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">   Flash</a> (Wally West) and <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">   Martian Manhunter</a> .) and to promote cultural and racial diversity. The line up of the team was changed slightly but still both goals were achieved. The line up of the series stood as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, Flash (<a href=\"/wally-west/29-23879/\">  Wally West</a>),&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">   Hawkgirl</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;(who replaced Aquaman in favor of a second female member) and the African American John Stewart as Green Lantern who replaced Kyle Rayner to promote racial diversity. Kyle Rayner (who appeared in Superman series) was not chosen for that reason and in season two Kyle was described as a trainee Green Lantern under the tutelage of John Stewards old mentor, although both Kyle would later make appearances in Justice League Unlimited.</p> <p>The show was greeted with great success somewhat due to many loyal fans who were already familiar with the incarnation of the characters but the show also introduced the characters to an entire generation. Due to the fact that most episodes were one of two parts Cartoon Network chose to run two episodes back to back. It was later learned in the DVD release of season two that the episode \u201cStarcrossed\u201d was expected to be the final episode of the entire series but in February 2004 Cartoon Network released the next season with a new name, Justice League Unlimited. The show premiered on July 31st 2004.</p> <p>The new series featured an expanded League who had opened their doors to nearly all of the Superhero community . Due to the great number of characters now in the show episodes tended to star three or four at a time so as to keep up with character development and so as not to drown out the quality of the show with quantity. In several episodes the entire roster of <a href=\"/justice-league-international/65-26208/\">   League</a> members star often the entire brut force of all the members are needed to fight off universal threats.</p><a> </a> <h2>Character changes</h2> <p>Timm sought out to keep the continuality of the Dc Animated Universe alive and so sought out Kevin Conroy to voice <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">   Batman</a>, who he played in Batman: The Animated Series (1992) and in Batman Beyond (1999). Conroy set out to make his voice different then the two previous incarnations of Batman as Justice League/Justice League Unlimited is set after Batman: The Animated Series and before Batman Beyond. To do this Conroy made his sot harsher and more weathered than Batman: The Animated Series but softer then<a href=\"/batman-beyond/49-6421/\">    Batman Beyond</a>. To also add to the development of the character Batman\u2019s costume was changed. The spikes or ears found at the top of his mask were made more prominent then in Batman: The Animated Series , his boots were also given slight heels and red highlights replaced the blue ones found in Batman : The Animated Series.</p> <p>Tim Daly was originally sought out to voice Superman as he had in the previous Superman series but was unable to. Instead George Newborn was brought in to voice the man of steel. During the first season he was deeply criticized as fans felt he lacked the authority that Daly brought to the role. Timm has stated that this was more a fault in the writing of the series then in Newborns abilities and has openly defended him every since. Many fans have been swayed by this feeling that Newborns performance has improved throughout the series and that both Daly\u2019s and Newborn\u2019s incarnations of the character both have merit and fault. Superman\u2019s over all look was redesigned so as to show him looking slightly older then in his previous animated series. To do this he was given a slight squint in his eyes and a slightly greying streak to his hair. He was also made to look broader in the series to suggest greater physical strength. Fans did not react well to the changes made and so at the beginning of season two the creators toned down the streak in his hair (to the point of almost disappearing) and took the squint away all together. As an inside joke to this failure the facial templates for the original <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">   Superman</a> were used for <a href=\"/jor-el/29-9561/\">   Jor-el</a> in the episode \u201cFor the Man who has Everything\u201d.</p> <p>Most other characters were left close enough to their comic book counterparts although some notable changes were made. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">   Wonder Woman</a>\u2019s (voiced by Susan Eisenberg) back story completely changed from that of her competing against her Amazonian sisters to her being an ambassador to the outside world. This is seen in the episode \u201cSecret Origins\u201d She has also been referred to as a rookie hero and several episodes touch on how hard she is finding it to adjust to the new life she now leads. Also the <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">   Flash</a> (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum) was given attributes that made him appear slightly younger and less mature then in his comic book incarnation. It has also been noted that he was given several traits to that of Plasticman who usually provides the comic relief for the team in the comic book series. In this incarnation of the team Flash was found to be the funny one. Much like the changes put under Wonder Woman, <a href=\"/john-stewart/29-10451/\">   John Stewart</a>\u2019s (voiced by Phil LaMarr) back story was also significantly changed. The original comic story was that of a civilian architect but was changed to him being a hardened ex-marine for the series.</p> <p>One character that was entirely changed was Aquaman. He was dropped completely from the team in place of Hawkgirl. Maria Canals was cast to voice the part of Hawkgirl because of her Hispanic accent. The creators thought that as Hawkgirl was not from Earth so&nbsp;it would make her stand out as a more foreign character within the team. Her back story was set so that she had been transported to earth by criminals using a Zeta beam. Hawkgirl and Green Lantern John Stewart began a romantic relationship. Later in the series it was revealed that she was actually a scout for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanagarians/65-31019/\">   Thanagarian</a> invasion force. Obviously the League felt betrayed by this, especially when the entire Thanagarian force arrived ready to over throw earth. To make matters worse Hawkgirl went to their aid. Eventually the <a href=\"/thanagarians/65-31019/\">   Thanagarians</a> left but Hawkgirl remained on earth. She fled from the League in shame and chose to stay with <a href=\"/doctor-fate/29-5898/\">   Dr.Fate</a> and his wife Inza&nbsp;in their stronghold to find piece of mind and a new direction in life. She was eventually brought back to kill her possessed friend <a href=\"/solomon-grundy/29-8342/\">   Solomon Grundy</a>. After this she chose to rejoin the league and was warmly excepted back into it. She decide to leave her Thangarain military dress for more conventional attire. Although her and John's relationship would never be the same again.</p> <p>Another romantic relationship was that of Batman and Wonder Woman. The creators of the show did not seem to like the fans insistence of Wonder Woman being paired with Superman. Although no relationship actually blossomed it was the intent of Wonder Woman but Batman on several occasions turned her down saying that if his villains knew about them they could use her to get to him. Although Batman kissed, danced and sang to save Wonder Woman, no one knows what he really wanted!!!</p> <p>Martian Manhunter also went under change. In his comic books he is found to have a power called Martian Vision usually shown as a beam of light, an extension off his telekinesis, but which also works very like Superman\u2019s heat vision. This power was dropped in his animated form in favor of his shape shifting and phasing abilities.</p> <h3><u>Heart of Ice</u></h3> <p>Up until Batman the Animated Series, <a href=\"/mr-freeze/29-3715/\">   Mr. Freeze </a>did not have much of a characterization or back story in the comics. Thanks to a unique design by Mike <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mike-mignola/26-1672/\">   Mignola</a> and a tragic back story thought up by Bruce Timm, Freeze went from a crummy hoodlum, to a tragic villain who only wanted to save his wife. Fan reception to this version of the character forced the story into mainstream. The episode he appeared in was \"Heart of Ice\" which introduced the entire background story and even ended up winning an Emmy for \"Best Animation\". Mr. Freeze would go on to be in every season of B:TAS, make an appearance in the first season of Batman Beyond, and even have his own movie dedicated to him.</p> <h3><u>Initiation</u></h3> <p>When the Justice League decided to expand their numbers they became incredibly powerful, it was Bruce Timm's choice to then add <a href=\"/green-arrow/29-5936/\">   Green Arrow</a> after popular fan demand. The fans saw Green Arrow as an almost eighth member to the original seven member team. A second reason to add Ollie was to form a bridge between the new JLU and the people on Earth. He was the first hero to appear in JLU. He appeared in \"Initiation\", the first episode of the first season. Originally he did not want to join because he felt that they had given up on the \"little man\" and he was the only thing protecting him, but after some convincing from Batman he joined and helped keep them together when Superman almost disbanded the group.</p> <h3><u>Question Authority</u></h3> <p>During the Justice League Unlimited run Bruce Timm decided to add one of his favorite characters, little did he know adding him would be a huge development. The Question first fully appeared in \"Fearful Symmetry\" where he was given a complete persona redesign. This Question was one of the league's top detectives (second to Batman and maybe <a href=\"/elongated-man/29-4437/\">   Elongated Man</a>) but he was incredibly paranoid and claimed to see patterns in useless bits of information. His design was the O'Neil version from the 80s comics and over the course of the series he developed a relationship with <a href=\"/huntress/29-1690/\">   Huntress</a>, much like his comic book counterpart. Timm's reaction to his <a href=\"/question/29-3211/\">   Question</a> made him want to do a series completely based on him and that is somewhat what he did for the second season (or first season according to the DVDs) finale in which the Question discovers a link between <a href=\"/lex-luthor/29-41952/\">   Luthor</a>, the <a href=\"/justice-lords/65-57288/\">   Justice Lords</a>, <a href=\"/project-cadmus/65-47233/\">   Cadmus</a>, and <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">   Flash</a> that could potentially destroy the planet. Fan reaction to Timm's version of the character was phenomenal and he, much like<a href=\"/green-arrow/29-5936/\">    Green Arrow</a>, became a major reoccurring character, </p> <h3><u>Differences</u></h3> <p>There are many notable differences between the regular DCU and the DCAU, here are a few:</p>-<a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">   Superman </a>does not have an \"S\" shield on his back&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/doctor-fate/29-5898/\">   Dr. Fate</a> does not have a fin on his helmet&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/jason-todd/29-6849/\">   Jason Todd</a> never existed&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/tim-drake/29-9290/\">   Tim Drake</a>'s origin is much closer to Jason Todd's&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/question/29-3211/\">   The Question</a> is a conspiracist and much more paranoid.&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/amazo/29-3737/\">   Amazo</a>'s appearance and characterization is severely different.&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">   Hal Jordan</a> does not seem to exist in the universe but he did appear in \"The Once And Future Thing\" Pt. 2 because of a time-space flux.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />-<a href=\"/doomsday/29-9989/\">   Doomsday</a> never killed <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">   Superman</a>.&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/static/29-26578/\">   Static</a> is in the same universe as <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">   Batman</a> and Superman opposed to a separate one.&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/john-stewart/29-10451/\">   John Stewart</a> and <a href=\"/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">   Hawkgirl</a> have a relationship here that was never present in the comics.&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/oracle/29-5368/\">   Barbara Gordon</a> was never paralyzed by the<a href=\"/joker/29-1702/\">    Joker</a>.&nbsp; <br />-<a href=\"/orion/29-2363/\">   Orion'</a>s Astro-Harness is silver instead of gold.  <h2>DVD Collections</h2> <p>The various DVDs collecting episodes of the different series.

They may also serve as the comedy relief in a story as well. Some notable sidekicks are <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky Barnes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a>,and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/speedy/29-5300/\">Speedy</a>. Many sidekicks created new identities when they grew up like Bucky (into Winter Soldier see <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky Barnes</a>) and the first robin (now <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightwing/29-1691/\">Batman</a>). The super hero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stripesy/29-30289/\">Stripesy</a> was very famous for being the adult sidekick to the teenage <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-spangled-kid/29-10998/\">Star-Spangled Kid</a>. Sidekicks may not only take a new identity when leaving their mentor but may later replace their mentor and take his on his mantle. For example Bucky becoming Winter Soldier then later becoming <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>&nbsp;and Dick Grayson becoming Batman.</p>\n<p>Sidekicks are also a way for young readers to relate to stories and feel as if they are working with or for the main hero.&nbsp;By tying young readers into relateable sidekicks they are then tied into the main hero which allows more readership. As a marketable tool sidekicks have done very well for comics mainly in the forties and fifties. Since then their deaths and resurrections have been very marketable. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />Below is an alphabetical list of superheroes and their sidekick counterparts.<br /></p>\n<table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Superhero</th>\n<th>Sidekick</th>\n<th>Publishers<br /></th></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Aquaman</td>\n<td>Aqualad, Aquagirl I, Aquagirl II, Aquagirl III, Aquagirl IV, Aqualad II</td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Batman</td>\n<td>Robin I, Robin II, Robin III, Robin IV, Robin V, Batgirl I, Batgirl II, Batgirl III, Batgirl IV</td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black Terror<br /></td>\n<td>Kid Terror<br /></td>\n<td>Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Blue Beetle (Dan Garret)<br /></td>\n<td>Sparky</td>\n<td>Fox Comics, Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Blue Devil<br /></td>\n<td>Kid Devil<br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Booster Gold<br /></td>\n<td>Skeets, Goldstar<br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Captain America<br /></td>\n<td>Bucky</td>\n<td>Marvel Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Captain Battle<br /></td>\n<td>Captain Battle Jr.<br /></td>\n<td>Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Captain Marvel<br /></td>\n<td>Mary Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr.<br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Catman</td>\n<td>Kitten</td>\n<td>Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Catwoman</td>\n<td>Catgirl</td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Doctor Mid-Nite</td>\n<td>Hooty</td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Dynamic Man<br /></td>\n<td>Dynamic Woman, Dynamic Boy<br /></td>\n<td>Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Flame</td>\n<td>Flame Girl<br /></td>\n<td>Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Flash</td>\n<td>Kid Flash I, Kid Flash II<br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Green Arrow</td>\n<td>Speedy I, Speedy II <br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Green Hornet<br /></td>\n<td>Kato</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Holyoke Comics, Harvey Comic, Dell Comics, Now Comics, Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Human Torch<br /></td>\n<td>Toro</td>\n<td>Marvel Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;Lone Ranger<br /></td>\n<td>Tonto</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Dell Comics, Dynamite Entertainment<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spider-girl<br /></td>\n<td>Scarlet spider<br /></td>\n<td>Marvel Comics <br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spirit<br /></td>\n<td>Ebony White<br /></td>\n<td>&nbsp;Newspaper Comics, DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Star-Spangled Kid</td>\n<td>Stripesy</td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Superman</td>\n<td>Superboy, Supergirl, Krypto<br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;The Tick</td>\n<td>&nbsp;Arthur</td>\n<td>&nbsp;New England Comics</td></tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Wonder Woman<br /></td>\n<td>Wonder Girl I, Wonder Girl II<br /></td>\n<td>DC Comics<br /></td></tr></tbody></table>",

        "description":"<h2>Concept Origin and History<br /></h2><p><b>Ex-Mutants</b> are <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">                           mutants</a> who once possessed the  X-Gene, a genetic trait that enabled superhuman abilities in otherwise normal humans.</p><p>These mutants lost their abilities after the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">                           Scarlet Witch</a> (the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">                           Avengers</a>' Wanda Maximoff) used a powerful spell during an attempt to remove all mutant powers, including her own, in order to stop the ongoing human-mutant conflict (see <i><a href=\"/house-of-m/39-40991/\"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><i>       The House of M</i>).&nbsp; <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">                           Doctor Stephen Strange</a> intervened and with the help of <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">                           Emma Frost'</a>s telepathy the two did their best to counter the spell.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they were largely unsuccessful and 90-98% of the mutant population lost their powers.&nbsp; The events of this day are generally known collectively as the mutant <a href=\"/decimation/39-43626/\">                           Decimation</a> or more commonly, <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">                           M-Day</a>.</p><p>The lucky few to remain unaffected by the Scarlet Witch's spell, dubbed by the media as \"<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/198/12-48559/\">                           The 198</a>\", make up only a few hundred of the once millions of mutants on Earth.</p><h2>Ex-Mutant Diaries</h2><p>Since M-Day, many Ex-Mutants were targetted and attacked, which could be attributed to prior fear and current vulnerability.&nbsp; A section of <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">                           New York</a> formerly dubbed \"<a href=\"/mutant-town/34-42359/\">                           Mutant Town</a>\" has since been all but cleared out of all mutants, despite being under the watchful eye of <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">                           X-Factor Investigations</a>.</p><p>In the wake of a series of Ex-Mutant killings, staff writer for the newspaper <i> </i><i>The Alternative</i>, Sally Floyd, followed several Ex-Mutants to showcase their lives without powers.&nbsp; Among her interviewees were former <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">                           X-Men</a> <a href=\"/jubilee/29-4562/\">                           Jubilee</a> and <a href=\"/ripcord/29-11517/\">                           Stacy X</a> (both of whom would later join the Ex-Mutant, anti-registration group the <a href=\"/new-warriors/65-11896/\">                           New Warriors</a> under the monikers <b>Wondra</b> and <b>Ripcord</b>, respectively).&nbsp; It was through these interviews that the X-Man <a href=\"/angel/29-2112/\">                           Angel</a> was able to track down the Ex-Mutant serial killer, a mutant named <a href=\"/ghoul/29-53492/\">                           The Ghoul</a>.</p><h2>Enter The New Warriors</h2><p>While some Ex-Mutants were able to land on their feet, many felt lost and defenseless without their mutant abilities.&nbsp; Some were no longer the freaks they once were, but were still largely unsatisfied with their lives.&nbsp; Some, including the X-Men's <a href=\"/decibel/29-2244/\">                           Chamber</a>, whose mutant powers burned a hole through his face and torso, were even suicidal without the thing they once considered a curse.</p><p>Shortly after M-Day, the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">                           Superhuman Registration Act</a> came into effect following the events of the <a href=\"/stamford-ct/34-45571/\">                           Stamford, Connecticut</a> and the <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">                           Marvel Civil War</a>.</p><p><a href=\"/night-thrasher/29-2098/\">                           Donyell Taylor</a>, a former mutant himself, had lost his brother, the original <a href=\"/night-thrasher/29-2098/\">                           Night Thrasher</a>, in the events that lead to the Civil War.&nbsp; To clear his brother's name and legacy, Donyell began to put together a group to combat the registration act and take it to the streets.&nbsp; Exploiting his fellow ex-mutants' sense of hopelessness, he recruited several former X-Men characters (<a href=\"/jubilee/29-4562/\">                           Jubilee</a>, <a href=\"/decibel/29-2244/\">                           Chamber</a>, <a href=\"/renascence/29-40537/\">                           Wind Dancer</a>, and <a href=\"/ripcord/29-11517/\">                           Stacy X</a>) as well as three rehabilitating rebellious teenagers that caused a riot at the Xavier Institute--<a href=\"/omega-men/65-14632/\">                           the Omega Gang</a>.&nbsp; Donyell supplied them technology to supplement their powerless states and the team went on to successfully defeat several villains before disbanding.</p><h2>Attempts at Repowering Since M-Day<br /></h2><p>While some Ex-Mutants have been able to replicate their former abilities, few, if any, are proper mutants again with an X-Gene proper.</p><p><a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">                           Polaris</a>, <a href=\"/gazer/29-40604/\">                           Gazer</a>, and <a href=\"/sunfire/29-3175/\">                           Sunfire</a> were implanted with alien technology by <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">                           Apoalypse</a> to replicate and enhance their previous abilities.</p><p><a href=\"/abyss/29-15323/\">                           Abyss</a>, <a href=\"/fatale/29-15099/\">                           Fatale</a>, and <a href=\"/reaper/29-10317/\">                           Reaper</a> were artifically granted their abilities via <a href=\"/terrigenesis/12-42287/\">                           Terrigenesis</a>.&nbsp; Their abilities will likely fade, like <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">                           Callisto</a>, <a href=\"/wicked/29-3425/\">                           Wicked</a>, <a href=\"/freakshow/29-4994/\">                           Freakshow</a>, and <a href=\"/shola-inkosi/29-3424/\">                           Shola Inkosi</a> before them.&nbsp; Nonetheless, their powers would be derived in the same fashion as the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\">                           Inhumans</a> and would not be considered mutants.&nbsp; However, <a href=\"/quicksilver/49-6013/\">                           Quicksilver</a>, who also used the process, spontaneously regained his abilities some time after the effects of the Terrigenesis had already worn off.&nbsp; It is not known if the resurgence of his power was due to the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/18-55807/\">                           Terrigen Crystals</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br />Beast took an extended quest at attempting to find the answers behind M-Day.&nbsp; However, he found no leads during his lengthy expedition, despite encountering the Dark Beast, several brilliant experts, conducting lab research experiments, and even confronting the Scarlet Witch himself.<br /></p><p><a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">                           Beast</a>, along with <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/29-24399/\">                           Madison Jeffries</a>, <a href=\"/dr-james-bradley/29-29259/\">                           Dr. James Bradley</a>, and several other brilliant scientists formed the <a href=\"/x-club/65-56306/\">                           X-Club</a>, a group whose goal is to work toward finding a cure for M-Day.&nbsp; Beast and <a href=\"/dark-beast/29-3422/\">                           Dark Beast</a> had previously worked together to find a solution, but were unable to find any leads to the problem.&nbsp; The group has failed to provide any answers following several missions.<br /></p><h2>Minor Success at Repowering </h2><p>As mentioned in the previous section, <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">                         Quicksilver</a>'s super-speed abilities returned during a time of dire need.&nbsp; This \"repowering\" is akin to <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">                        Iceman</a>'s resurgence of his mutant abilities after he thought he had lost them after M-Day.&nbsp; After brain scans conducted by the X-Men, it was revealed he had merely placed a mental block on himself from using his powers.&nbsp; It is not known if this applies to Quickisilver's case or any other depowered mutants. <br />&nbsp;<br />Oddly enough some mutants retained physical aspects of their mutation.&nbsp; <a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">                       Polaris</a>, whose original mutation was her green hair, seemingly lost only her magnetic abilities.&nbsp; <a href=\"/marrow/29-13726/\">                      Marrow</a> still retains protruding bones on her forehead and presumably elsewhere on her body.&nbsp; Without her mutant healing factor, Marrow would likely die of infection but was able to still fight at her peak alongside the ex-mutant group <a href=\"/x-cell/65-43339/\">                     X-Cell</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br />Former <a href=\"/generation-x/65-15083/\">                    Generation X</a> and X-Men member <a href=\"/decibel/29-2244/\">                  Chamber</a> received a blood transfusion from <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">                 Apocalypse</a>, which led to unspecified changes to the young ex-mutant.&nbsp; Following the transfusion, power readings from his location detected an omega-level mutant.&nbsp; While masquerading as <b>Decibel</b> with the New Warriors, Chamber refrained from using his natural abilities and instead opted to using the technology supplied by the team's benefactor, <a href=\"/night-thrasher/29-2098/\">                Donyell Taylor</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br /></p><a>                   Professor X</a> made contact with the reality-altering <a>              M'Kraan crystal</a>&nbsp; to restore his mutant abilities and X-Gene.&nbsp; His arch-rival, <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">             Magneto</a>, has since made contact with the <a href=\"/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">            High Evolutionary</a> to use experimental procedures to return his abilities.&nbsp; Working alongside his former teammate and fellow depowered mutant <a href=\"/blob/29-3182/\">           Blob</a>, Magneto's magnetic abilities returned. <br />&nbsp;<br /><a>     Selene</a> and her partner, <a href=\"/eli-bard/29-59642/\">    Eli Bard</a>, have recently begun a quest at resurrecting mutants via   Selene's sorcery and Bard's ability to infect and control others with the <a href=\"/techno-organic/12-43631/\">       Transmode virus</a>.&nbsp; The mutants revived have all displayed their mutant powers, including confirmed depowered mutants <a href=\"/feral/29-2160/\">   Feral</a>, <a href=\"/tarot/29-2140/\">  Tarot</a>, and <a href=\"/unus/29-3438/\"> Unus</a>.&nbsp; It is not known if these mutants powers are being mimicked by the Transmode virus or if their mutant gene has been restored due to Selene's immense magical abilities.<br /><br /><h2>List of Notable Ex-Mutants</h2><p>The following is a list of notable mutants who lost their abilities during M-Day, the issue where their status is confirmed, and other relevant, power status-related updates:<br /></p><p><br /></p><h2>- A -<br /></h2><p><a href=\"/abyss/29-15323/\">                           Abyss</a> (Nils Styger) - <i>Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A to Z</i> #1;

        "description":"<p>What I would like to see here is as detailed a description of the toy as possible, including year of manufacture.  Color variations of the same item would not count as different unless the change was something that effected the character in comics.  An example of this would be the second and third versions of the Wonder woman doll, which had, respectively, different costumes and a different box than the original.</p><p>The very first Wonder Woman doll, because girls never played with \u2018action figures\u2019 back then, was created in 1967 and was marketed by Ideal.</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45784/64775-comic-based-toys_400.jpg</p><p>Notice the dark eagle instead of the usual golden one on her costume and the Captain America-esque shield.  One thing that has yet to change since 1967: that foot wear.  Those are lovely Greek style high heeled sandals but still very tiring to fight crime in.<br /></p><p>Next came Mego\u2019s first try at Wonder Woman.  First appearing in 1975, this was a smaller figure than they would go on to produce.  It\u2019s now fairly rare but check out the awful details any way.  Her costume is all one piece, including the flesh colored arms and torso.  Why did they bother with the colored cuffs? The figure next to her is Wonder Girl from the Teen Titans (to be produced in 1976).</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45784/111783-comic-based-toys_400.jpg</p><p>Now, marketing being the cash creator that it is, Mego\u2019s next version of Wonder Woman was a smash as it coincided with the airing on the television series.  She really looked like Lynda Carter too!  12\u201d tall, she came with a painted on bodice that was easily scratched if you played with it.  She had a rubber tiara and a golden lasso that was pretty much a coated rubber bad.  She also came with a change of clothes so that she could revert to Yeoman Diana Prince.  sigh How disappointing that she didn\u2019t change clothes when you spun her around though.<br /></p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45784/54791-comic-based-toys_400.jpg</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45784/149545-comic-based-toys_400.jpg</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45784/146349-comic-based-toys_400.jpg</p><p>It should be noted that a year later, in 1979, Mego re-released the doll with a cloth one piece outfit.  She also came with modern era clothes rather than the military uniform so as to reflect the change in venue on TV.   Interestingly enough, this one looked less like Lynda Carter and she didn\u2019t appear on the box.  Most likely this was because the show had begun to slip in ratings.  There was a third version of the 12\u201d doll but the main difference was in the box itself, which still used the same comic drawing but added a description of Paradise Island and, of course, the not so subtle hint that you could surround Wondy with friends and foes.

Here lies a gallery in which we can be reminded of the artists great work. So if you have a fantastic poster you need to show everyone or your just looking for imagination, enlighten yourself here.</p><p>117284-comicbook-centrefold_100</p> <p>this image shows Spider-Man fighting all of his different enemies. This catalog's all of his various foe's, and is a great piece of art work, it really has to be appreciated up close though, the detail is fantastic.</p><p>This image pictures Spider-man again, this time you see the web slinger rescuing his beloved Mary Jane from the clutches of every one of his enemies! close call Spidey!</p> <p>This picture is a brilliant example of what every marvel character would look like assembled in one place at the same time. this is such a good picture because it constantly surprises you, just when u think u have named every single one, wait... no... there's one more, and another, and another. brilliant piece of art. </p> <p>This is a really good picture of Logan (Wolverine) showing off his amazing healing factor after being shot 23 times! They shading affect applied here is almost like a slight colour cross hatch. Go Wolvey!</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45787/23427-comicbook-centrefold_400.jpg</p><p>landing</p><p>This guy needs no introduction! THE MIGHTY THOR! Enough said i think!</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45787/36496-comicbook-centrefold_400.jpg</p><p>This is a comic advertisement/poster. it advertises the New Avengers animated film, it is a good picture of Captain America. Slightly corny and a little too American for most tastes, with the F-16 and the attack helicopter in the back ground. But good all the same!</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45787/70983-comicbook-centrefold_400.jpg</p><p>This is one of my favorite pictures i have seen as far as comic pullout poster go. The amount of work that must of gone into this is huge. Well done who ever created this, it is truly amazing. IT is a picture of Spider-Man landing or leading on/off a car hood. amazing use of the 3D affect.</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45787/179594-comicbook-centrefold_400.jpg</p><p>This image is a good one also, very eye catching, how both the figures of Batman and Superman emulate each other and their capes are virtually a mirror image of each other. But it does go to show how unimaginative DC comics became with their 2 most major characters, both costumes are very similar. With the knee high boots, tights, capes, and underwear on the outside of their clothes.</p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45787/155161-comicbook-centrefold_400.jpg</p><p>This is a perfect example why Spawn comics are the most intricate comics around. The actual artists involved in this </p><p>masterpiece should be knighted or at least given the key to the city! This is a breath taking piece of work. I don't even want to think about how long this would of taken a team to put together. </p><p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45787/81765-comicbook-centrefold_400.JPG</p><p>This next image is of the amazing Supergirl.

        "description":"<p>Primordial chaos and darkness opposite of order and light, <a href=\"/the-angelus/29-43945/\">Angelus</a>. Darkness is considered one of the <a href=\"/the-13-artifacts/12-55685/\">13 Artifacts</a>. Darkness and Angelus also have an offspring, that acts as balance between the two forces, it is named <a href=\"/witchblade/29-18319/\">Witchblade</a>.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The wielder of the Darkness possesses a number of supernatural abilities. The Darkness power allows the wielder to create anything they desire. One of the primary weapons of the Darkness is the ability to generate solid constructs such as blades, claws, and protective armor. The darkness can also be used to create living, sentient beings that are controlled by the wielder. These darkness creatures are often in the form of imps or demons often referred to as <a href=\"/darklings/65-47569/\">Darklings</a>. They tend to be violent in nature, and use a lot of profanity when they talk. The possessor of the darkness can also hear and see remotely through these creatures. Close proximity is also not necessary as they can be created and left in a dark area and controlled remotely via a telepathic control over the creatures.</p><p>Creations of the Darkness are not limited to Darklings, however. Possessors of the Darkness in the past have even created human-like creatures out of the Darkness for many purposes including sex (see Weaknesses and Limitations: Celibacy).</p><h2>Weaknesses and Limitations</h2><h3><b>Light</b></h3><p>As suggested by the name, a primary weakness of the Darkness is that it only functions in the absence of light. The Darkness cannot be accessed in the light and when light hits anything created of the Darkness it vanishes. This leaves the wielder particularly vulnerable during the day, however even during the day if protection from the light can be found the Darkness can be used. The darkness can be accessed simply by being in a non-lit room or even under the cover of smoke as long as it is thick enough to provide protection from the light.</p><h3><b>Celibacy</b></h3><p>All wielders of the Darkness pass on the Darkness to their heirs through sex. Upon the conception of their child they die, so males in the Estacado family generally die during intercourse. This can be quite a burden for some, and the Darkness has been used in the past to create sentient humanoids for the purpose of sexual gratification.</p><h2>Hosts</h2><p>This is a list of all those who have wielded the Darkness Power</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkness/12-45822/all-images/108-219387/past2/105-649495/\">Unnamed Past Wielder</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkness/12-45822/all-images/108-219387/black_captain2/105-865832/\">Black Captain</a> (9th century)</li><li><a href=\"/lord-cardinale/29-52136/\">Lord Cardinale</a></li><li><a href=\"/the-foreigner/29-62333/\">The Foreigner</a></li><li><a href=\"/idris/29-62711/\">Idris</a></li><li><a href=\"/christian-estacado/29-50101/\">Christian Estacado</a></li><li><a href=\"/michaelangelo-estacado/29-52559/\">Michaelangelo Estacado</a> (16th century)</li><li><a href=\"/belasco-estacado/29-52556/\">Belasco Estacado</a></li><li><a href=\"/antonio-estacado/29-52553/\">Antonio Estacado</a></li><li><a href=\"/miguel-estacado/29-45821/\">Miguel Estacado</a> (17th century)</li><li>Ramon Estacado (mid 19th century)</li><li>Teo Estacado (late 19th century)</li><li><a href=\"/anthony-estacado/29-47570/\">Anthony Estacado</a></li><li><a href=\"/roberto-estacado/29-52550/\">Roberto Estacado</a></li><li><a href=\"/danny-estacado/29-45820/\">Danny Estacado</a> (late 20th century)</li><li><a href=\"/capris-castiglione/29-52521/\">Capris Castiglione</a> - Twin-sister of Jackie Estacado, first female host.</li><li><a href=\"/the-darkness/29-24347/\">Jackie Estacado</a> - Current possessor of The Darkness, known also as The Darkness.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkness/12-45822/power-of-the-darkness/108-9458/darkness4/105-706070/\">Bud Starling</a> - Possible near future wielder.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkness/12-45822/all-images/108-219387/future1/105-649496/\">Unnamed Future Wielder</a></li></ul><h2>The Loophole</h2><p>It has been stated that Jackie Estacado would die and pass on the Darkness to his offspring if he were to create a child through sexual intercourse. However, the loophole in this rule is that since the Darkness is an entire entity itself, it could create an offspring itself without having Jackie killed in the process. This was a major part of the First Born story arc as Jackie revealed that one night, the Darkness took control of his body and had sexual intercourse with a comatose Sara in the hospital.</p>",

In children's comics (DC and Marvel), everyone wants to be able to talk about their favorite characters so names are a given but in other publishers, names are secondary. Its not that everyone is mysterious and there are no important characters, its just that the name itself is not really needed to further the story. For example, the Saint of Killers is never named once, not because his origin is secret, in fact his origin is told in a four-issue miniseries, its because his name isn't important, and as such neither are his wife and daughter named, because they don't need to be, the only thing that makes them important is their relationship to Saint, knowing their names won't change the story.<br /><br />Most of the time though, to replace the absence of a name, such as with The Saint of Killers family, their relationship to characters that are named will be mentioned, while other times there just characters that no one can ever refer to without a picture or something of the sort.",

        "description":"<a></a> <h2>Before the Battle</h2>&nbsp;<br />Darth Vader on nearing completion of the Death Star had kidnapped Princess Leia because the Empire was lead to believe the Rebels had stolen the Death Star's plans and she was in possession of them. Feeling the need to test the Empire newest most powerful weapon they headed to Alderaan, where after Darth Vader tried coaxing information out of the princess was promptly destroyed. And later Princess Leia was rescued by Obi Wan, Luke, Han Solo, and Chewbacca, who all planned an attack against the Empire with the plans Leia had given R2D2 before she was kidnapped, and was later picked up by Luke Skywalker.&nbsp;&nbsp;Which they discovered the only weakness against the Death Star was and exhaust port lead to the main reactor, allowing a single proton torpedo to take down the mighty weapon.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;  <h2>Battle</h2>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Following the allowed escape and rescue of Princess Leia, Vader tracked her to the rebel base on the fourth moon of the planet Yavin, where the Death Star arrived escorted by a small fleet while the Death Star charged it main planet destroying weapon. Still planning their attack, the rebels had sent a small attack unit of X-Wings to shoot down a communications satellite set up by the Empire so that they could relay information more easily. The small attack was a success and threw into confusion the Empire's defense and their ability to call reinforcements. Although two of the X-wings were shot down, the pilots of which were rescued later.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;After several more preliminary strikes made by the rebels to several key points on the Death Star including small hangars on the surface to limit it's ability to launch fighters, the rebels sent into action their main offensive attack. The assaulting fleet consisted of almost two dozen X-wings, eight y-wings, and a pair of R22 Spearhead star fighters.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Firstly the Death Star tried to defend itself with it's laser batteries, but some had been shot by the preliminary rebel strikes, and those that were left were mainly used to fight off capital ships, much larger than the smaller more nimble fighters being used by the Rebel Alliance. The rebels were able to take down several turret and a rookie pilot known as Rookie One was able to destroy a giant mounted ion cannon to set up the main phase of the assault.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Refusing to concede that the rebels were actually doing any damage the the Death Star, it's commander Grand Moff Tarkin did not send any of the station's vast resource TIE fighters. So Darth Vader under the realization that there might be even a minor threat scrambled his personal fighter squadron. Soon after Vader's fighters launched they attacked the rebel forces, and the order to stop all laser fire from the Death Star had been given. Mostly because the lasers themselves were doing very little in shooting down any rebels, and if they did manage to hit something it was just as likely they would hit one of the TIE fighters doing more damage.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;The rebels main offensive bombing run had been planned for three attempts at a trench run, the first and second runs were &nbsp;executed by Gold Squadron, consisting of three Y-wings, and a squadron of three X-wings called Red Squadron, both of were unsuccessful and missed the small exhaust target. The third was lead by Luke Skywalker and two other X-wings, one of which was damaged and had to pull out while the other was destroyed.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It was at this time that the Death Star had fully charged it's weapon and was in position to fire. All seemed hopeless for Rebel Command and the last fighter who could take one last shot, Luke, disabled his targeting computer in his X-wing. However Skywalker was told by the spirit of old \"Ben\" Kenobi to \"use the force\" to make the near impossible shot. Sensing how strong the force was with Luke, Vader prepared to kill him, saving the Empire, and it was only the last minute heroic deed of Han Solo and Chewbacca in the Millennium Falcon that sent Darth Vader spinning out of control in space and saved Luke. With the aid of the force, that was newly discovered to him, Luke Skywalker guided his last minute shot perfectly down the planned target. Seconds before the Death Star fired it's main weapon the chain reaction from Luke's torpedos had started and the station was blown up, and all on board including Grand Moff Tarkin, thousands of Imperial officers, and over one million support troops and stormtroopers were killed.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /> <h2>Repercussions</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;As a direct result of the Rebel Alliance victory, they were now a legitimate threat against the Empire, and because of dissolution in the Imperial Senate, &nbsp;systems joined the Alliance in the months afterwards by the thousands. This caused the Empire to start occupying territories it had left untouched. The actions of both sides resulted in the escalation of the war.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Lastly, twenty five years later it was decreed by the New Republic Historical Council to institute a new calendar. Some were using the fall of Palpatine as a year zero, but due to the significance of the battle and destruction of the Death Star, the date of the battle of Yavin &nbsp;was established by the council as the official year zero setting up a \"BBY\", Before the Battle of Yavin, and \"ABY\", After the Battle of Yavin calendar.",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>To perform techniques a ninja must first utilize a form of energy source named, \"Chakra\" Chakra originates from two places: the first is physical energy which is inherent in the billions of cells, the second source of chakra is the mental &amp; spiritual energy gained through exercise and experience. The body itself possess many points of concentration these are often referred to as chakra points. In order to perform a jutsu, the ninja will bring out and release these two energies. The amount of chakra needed for a technique will vary greatly, depending upon its size and complexity. It will also vary from user to user depending on their chakra capacity. Ninjas are able to manipulate chakra to use jutsus, molding and shaping the chakra to create the effect they want.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"912456\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/46150/912456-59799_chart_super_super.gif\" title=\"\"><img id=\"912456\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/46150/912456-59799_chart_super_medium.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>However, each ninja also has the potential to utilize an elemental Ninjutsu style. This is due to the fact that every ninja possess one elemental affiliation. For example, Naruto possess a wind affiliation and Kakashi possess a lightning affiliation. With an elemental affiliation comes an advantage as well as a disadvantage. For example the advantage of having a lightning elemental affiliation is that a ninja with that affiliation can master lightning based techniques more easily as well being able to perform higher level lightning based attacks. Possessing a lightning affiliation grants the ninja a higher advantage over someone possessing an earth affiliation, however the disadvantage of having a lightning affiliation is having a disadvantage over a ninja with a wind affiliation. In other words while acquiring an advantage over one opponent with a weakness to your affiliation, your affiliation has a weakness of its own. For this reason many ninja train themselves to recompose their chakra into different elemental based techniques to acquire a higher level of defense should they encounter their polar opposite as well as more options in combat. But because the ninja does not possess that particular elemental affiliation learning new moves requires more effort and limits their ability to be able to handle higher level techniques with that element.</p><h2>Main Elemental Chakras</h2><h3><strong>Katon</strong></h3><p>The Fire element technique. Katon takes on fire and flame based attacks. Its specialized as an offensive type of chakra and oftens create flame based attacks which are hurled from a distance, that gives the user distance between themselves and their opponent.</p><h3>Fuuton</h3><p>The Wind element technique takes wind based properties from a simple gust of wind to a typhoon. Out of all the elemental chakras Fuuton is most respected for it's ability to slice or act as an amplifier such as turning a simple kunai into an unstoppable bullet.</p><h3>Raiton</h3><p>The Lighting element technique takes on and off lighting based attacks.It also specializes in offensive type of chakra like fire and its ability lies in creating mid range and long attacks. It can also be used by a metal weapon like conductor. A technique that was famously used by Kakashi's father Sakumo Hatake.</p><h3>Doton</h3><p>The Eath element technique is based around earth style and it specializes in defense. By taking advantage pf the properties that make up earth. It can be used as a near perfect escape route such as using a mud slide technique to incapacitate the enemy.</p><h3><strong>Suiton</strong></h3><p>The Water element technique varies greatly depending on the users surrounding and the user itself, because of it's malleability it can be used to create powerful defenses as well as offenses. It can be from short to long range. However it's major weakness is it's user must be near any kind of water, but this however can be overcome as proven by the Nidame Hokage and Hoshigaki Kisame.</p>",

The result is stories that make characters who are as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow.\" \u00a9 DC Comics</p></blockquote><p>Elseworlds are published by DC comics and have been since the late 80\u2019s, before that they were known as \u2018Imaginary Stories\u2019 where a fresh idea or alternate histories were tried out on existing characters or storylines. Most notably during the Silver age of comics era a lot of these \u2018Imaginary Stories\u2019 were published using DC\u2019s main characters of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>, though they did also branch out into DC\u2019s other \u2018mainstream\u2019 characters.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1031551\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43390/1031551-sept_1986_super.jpg\" title=\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, the last 'Imaginary Story'\"><img id=\"1031551\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43390/1031551-sept_1986_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, the last 'Imaginary Story'\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow, the last 'Imaginary Story'</div></div></div></div><p>In 1986, the last ever \u2018Imaginary Story\u2019 was published in Superman vol 1 #423 and Action Comics #583, called \u201cWhatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow.\u201d This two part story arc was promoted as Superman's final appearance at DC Comics. In this story, the Superman timeline is irrevocably altered in several ways and became a darker, more sinister place.</p><p>The main story was told using flashbacks of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lois-lane/29-1808/\">Lois Lane</a>, who became Lois Lane-Elliot, who was being interviewed about Superman\u2019s last appearance. \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow\" was a farewell story to honor the previous version of Superman. In the following month of 1986, John Byrne published <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-man-of-steel/49-3611/\">the Man of Steel</a> mini series which presented an updated version of Superman for the modern age.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1031474\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43390/1031474-319529_20720_124252_1_gotham_by_gaslight_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Gotham by Gaslight, the unofficial first Elseworld\"><img id=\"1031474\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43390/1031474-319529_20720_124252_1_gotham_by_gaslight_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gotham by Gaslight, the unofficial first Elseworld\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gotham by Gaslight, the unofficial first Elseworld</div></div></div></div><p>In 1989 DC comics copyrighted the \u2018Elseworlds\u2019 name, along with the now famous logo and published its first official Elseworlds title, \u201cGotham by Gaslight\u201d. Though this story does not carry the Elseworlds logo, it was retroactively changed to be the first official Elseworlds title by DC and reprints of the book carry the logo. This story was a fresh take on Batman who lived in the Victorian Age instead of modern day. The main Villain in the piece is Jack the Ripper who has come to Gotham.</p><p>The first book to officially bear the Elseworlds logo and mantra was <a href=\"/batman-holy-terror/49-28207/\">Batman: Holy Terror</a>, written by TV writer and novelist <a href=\"/alan-brennert/26-42256/\">Alan Brennert</a> and illustrated by Detective Comics stalwart <a href=\"/norm-breyfogle/26-4768/\">Norm Breyfogle</a>. In it, Batman is a priest in a theocratic dictatorship who discovers that his parents were murdered by the Church. Searching for answers and vengeance, he discovers the dark secrets at the heart of his own government, and ultimately becomes a terrorist to dismantle the system which murdered \u201cheretics\u201d such as his parents.</p><p>To date DC has published several Elseworlds of particular note that are considered to be \u2018The Best of their League\u201d, two specifically of note are Kingdom Come and The Dark Knight Returns. Both of these stories have received world wide acclaim for their storyline and artwork.</p><h2>The Dark Knight Returns</h2><p>The Dark Knight Returns was originally published in 1986 as a four part miniseries by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frank-miller/26-7082/\">Frank Miller</a>, it has since been widely thought of as his best work. The series was originally intended by Miller to create an end for the Batman, one where the storyline would have a complete close, this turned out not to be the case when DC published a sequel to the book \u201cThe Dark Knight Strikes Again\u201d, a sequel to The Dark Knight Returns which brought back the original team to work on the book.</p><p>The Dark Knight Returns is set in a dark future where Batman had given up the Superhero life and gone into seclusion. While the Superheroes had left humanity to its own devices crime, both by humans and meta humans, had run rampant, and the world was quickly tearing itself apart.</p><p>The story opens on Harvey Dent being rehabilitated after plastic surgery, funded by Wayne Enterprises. The rehabilitation does not take however and he returns to crime, forcing Batman to don the Batman costume again, something he has not done since the death of Jason Todd twenty years earlier. The story also brings in Carrie Kelly who joins Batman as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a> for the story arc, notably not the first time Robin has been female in an Elseworlds title. Also worth noting is the fact that it is Harvey Dent as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/two-face/29-5555/\">Two-Face</a> that bring the Batman out of retirement, not the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joker/29-1702/\">Joker</a> as most people assume it would be.</p><p>Other changes to the Batman story become apparent as the story moves on, such as the new tank like Batmobile which is mirrored in the Cartoon version of The Batman and has made several other appearances in media as homage to the title.</p><h2>Kingdom Come</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"37772\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"37772\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/37772-5753-42353-1-kingdom-come_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Possibly the most noteworthy Elseworlds title to date and has been widely received as the definitive book published by DC. Published in 1996 is was written by Mark Waid and painted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alex-ross/26-10945/\">Alex Ross</a>, notably the artwork in the book is unusually realistic for a comic book and uses Ross\u2019s famous style to depict the realism and darkness of the storyline.</p><p>Set 20 years in the future, the superheroes have left the world to its own devices, feeling betrayed and unsure of their place in the new world. The main story centres on Superman and his reasons for leaving, and returning. Other characters of note are Batman, who was crippled by Bane and Two-Face after they found out his secret identity, he now uses giant Bat Robots to keep Gotham City under control. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>, who has been stripped of her title by Thymescria after the ruling body of The Amazon\u2019s decreed that she had not made the world a better place. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-2350/\">Captain Marvel</a> who had retreated inside the form of Billy Batson, his alter ego, and was kept in a hypnotic state by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lex-luthor/29-41952/\">Lex Luthor</a> to keep him under control.</p><p>Both these stories are widely recognized as the best Elseworlds to date, though Kingdom Come draws heavily on The Dark Knight Returns for some of its imagery, both of these have sequels, though not as popular as the original books, both the sequels received the same acclaim, \u2018The Dark Knight Strikes Again\u2019 and \u2018The Kingdom\u2019 respectively follow \u201cThe Dark Knight Returns\u201d and \u201cKingdom Come\u201d.</p><p>One thing of note is in \u201cThe Kingdom\u201d is the first mention of Hypertime, which DC used to explain the Elseworlds stories as parallel dimensions where beings could cross timelines and see what their world could have been like.</p><p>Hypertime has recently been brought back into the mainstream DCU continuity after the \u201c52\u201d storyline, though if this means that new Elseworlds storylines will be published or Elseworlds characters will be making appearances in the mainstream DCU in unclear at this point, all that is known is the possibility is there for anything.</p><h2>Elseworlds</h2><p>Here is a list of

These are not officially labeled as Elseworld tales but many consider them to be Elseworlds because they take place in the distant future and feature stories influenced by the legends/stories/legacies of the heroes and villains of the past for that particular title. A few of these annuals are actually in continuity because the characters are from the distant future.

        "description":"<a> </a><h2>1. Start with what you like</h2><p>Rather than divulging yourself into a comic book universe (or maybe many), focus on one character or a team (<a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">           X-Men</a>, <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">          JLA</a>) only. Even independent developers have large universes. Pick one of the most popular characters or teams from one publisher that relate to you the most and stick with them. This way, you can track that certain character or team without losing yourself within the comic's universe. Also, take genres into consideration. Looking for a bit of sci-fi? Check out <a href=\"/dark-horse-comics/57-364/\">         Dark Horse</a> and have a look at their take on <a href=\"/the-force/12-50253/\">        Star Wars</a>. For example, if you choose <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">       Wonder Woman</a> as your prime candidate and during that time, the more recent issues of Wonder Woman would be a good place to start. Once you are familiar with such a character, you may lose interest in them. Remember, this is only so you can get yourself started in comics, but they may also become your favourite character. Once you being with that certain character(s), there may be cross-overs. Using Wonder Woman as an example again, you might want to start with the runs by writers such as <a href=\"/greg-rucka/26-41228/\">  Greg Rucka</a> and <a href=\"/gail-simone/26-41294/\"> Gail Simone</a>. If you want something a little further back, try the Wonder Woman Chronicles trades, or her <a href=\"/showcase-presents-wonder-woman/49-30501/\">   Showcase Presents</a> volumes.<br /></p><p>One daunting issue concerning new collectors is the high issue numbers of long-time ongoing series'. &nbsp;When you want to read a book about a particular character you may feel like you are coming in too late when current issues are being published with issue numbers in the 400's, 500's, or more. &nbsp;Do not be afraid of high issue numbers. &nbsp;Comic writers will periodically give users \"jumping-off\" points at certain issue numbers (often at the 50's or 100's) to start a series. &nbsp;Larger series' are also divided into different \"story-archs\" which serve as logical partitions of the larger series, typically lasting between 2 and 6 issues. &nbsp;These smaller subplots interconnect to form the larger idea. &nbsp;Regardless of where you start out in a book, these divisions can give you the feel for a new book. &nbsp;If you are concerned about catching up on the back-story you have missed (after all, some of these series' have been going on for decades) you can look for used books to fill in the gaps later, and read encyclopedia articles from ComicVine to give you an idea of what you have missed in a character or team's history.</p><p>Another way to catch up without picking up individual issues is to collect Trade Paper Backs (sometimes referred to simply as \"trades\" or TPBs). &nbsp;Trade Paper Backs are reprinted collections of issues (generally by story-arch or series, but sometimes by general theme), and can be purchased new or used at a variety of stores. &nbsp;If you are more interested in reading books, and less interested in&nbsp;the&nbsp;physical (paper) copies digital comics are rapidly becoming an interesting alternative. &nbsp;Some major companies such as Marvel are now putting digital copies of their books online. &nbsp;Some of these books can be viewed for free, and others can be purchased or subscribed to digitally.</p><a> </a><h2>2. Comic book stores</h2><p>What you need from a good comic book store is a good selection of your chosen character and staff that know what they're talking about. With most comic book stores, a pull list is available, which allows you to select your favourite comics each week and the staff will collect the issues when they come in, and comics arrive on Wednesday. &nbsp;Many will also give you a discount to have your pull list or \"folder\" with them. &nbsp;A comic book store is also preferred if it is clean. Such things like dust will deteriorate the comic book's preservation. Lighting is also a bonus but probably not always needed. However, lighting allows you to see the comics properly and to see what state they are in. &nbsp;This does not hold for sunlight, which can damage comic books. &nbsp;Also, try not to spend too much too quickly. &nbsp;Modern comic books are often released in limited quantities with special variant covers, and because of their associated rarity these books may sell for many times what normal books cost. &nbsp;Antique comics of your favorite characters are also often available at comic book stores. &nbsp;While these types of books may be tempting, remember to go slow. &nbsp;New collectors may wind up with a collection of books that they overpaid or are otherwise unhappy with because they spent too much too fast.</p><p>If comic stores aren't in your present area, using a mail catalogue order is useful, as you order the comics you would like on the Internet and they get sent to your door. Payment is usually through credit card. Buying from a company's site also allows you to receive discounts from the original price if you subscribe to their services. Other sites like eBay and Amazon also provide comics to buy at discounted prices and mostly good condition. Also, comics are not restricted to comic book stores, even though they are the preferred place to buy. Major book stores like Barnes and Nobles also sell comic books.</p><p>Another place where you can get the opportunity to read more books without having to spend money is your local library. &nbsp;Many libraries are starting to obtain Trade Paper Backs for you to check out and enjoy without ever spending a dime.</p><h2>3. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/comic-book-care/44586/\"> <b> </b><b>       Comic Book Care</b></a></h2> <p>Caring for you comic books is important if you ever want to pass them down to the next generation or want to re-read them. The easiest way is to buy bags and boards for you comic books from the comic book store, and place them in short or long boxes, which are also available at comic book stores. This will seem like a money waster, but it will pay out in the end and allow your comics to look much nicer. Check out Comic Book Care for more information on other options on how to take care of your comics.</p><a> </a><h2>4. Comic book databases</h2><p>Take note of each comic book that you buy. You could use a notebook or a spreadsheet application on your computer. Keep track of your collection while it's still young, so if you ever miss an issue of a certain comic book, you can go back and attempt to find it on eBay or something. Also, you can check out the back issue section in your store and see if they have anything there.</p><a> </a><h2>5. Be cheap for once</h2><p>As with any hobby, collecting comic books can be expensive. &nbsp;Sometimes, your local comic book store might have a sale on for some really old comics. Get it while you can, because this can be great to growing your collection. &nbsp;However, don't buy everything that's on sale. Just focus on your focused character. This will allow you to add more depth to learning about the history of your chosen character. This also allows you for something extra to read when you've read everything on your pull list.</p><p>Also be on the lookout for cheap comics elsewhere. &nbsp;Some places where great deals on comics in a variety of ages and conditions are yard sales, swap meets, and flea markets/malls. &nbsp;Be careful not to spend too much at these places because they are also great places to get ripped off. &nbsp;If you are still new to comics and do not understand the subtleties of <a href=\"/comic-book-grading/12-44517/\">            comic book grading</a>, or do not have an idea of what comics from different ages are worth you may get suckered into a \"great deal\" that turns out to be not so great. &nbsp;Such salesman may not be bad people. &nbsp;They may have little more idea than you of what their books are worth. &nbsp;If you are collecting for your own personal enjoyment you can hardly go wrong spending a dollar or less on comics. &nbsp;Sometimes you can find them as cheap as a quarter a piece. &nbsp;As mentioned earlier second hand auction sites on the internet can be used to help build a collection for chap, however be careful. &nbsp;There are many dangers (primarily being ripped off) associated with internet auctions, so use these sites at your own risk.</p><a> </a><h2>6. Attend a comic book convention<br /></h2><p>Attend a comic convention, such as <a href=\"/san-diego-comic-con/34-55786/\">     ComicCon</a>. Doing so will allow you to interact with other comic book lovers and maybe allow you to make a friend or two sharing the same favourite of a character as you. &nbsp;You also will often have the opportunity to meet the writers and artists behind your favorite books in person, often getting a signature or sketch while you are there. &nbsp;Attending ComicCons also allow you to buy plenty of issues missed on your chosen character and browsing through all the booths are enjoyable. Also, you may also get some news on new and up coming comic storylines and new movies that are being made. ComicCons may not always visit your city, but that doesn't mean it will stop you from attending smaller ones.</p><a> </a><h2>7. One more thing - enjoy it!</h2><p>Don't take this hobby too seriously, unless that's what you want. Comic books should be enjoyed by everyone and each character should be respected. Voicing your opinion may induce some interesting discussions, but in reality, they are created to be read. For example, some comic readers use it as a means of escape. Also, don't be embarrassed if you don't know much about your favourite character. Comic books are meant to be a world of discovery. Starting from where you are and enjoying yourself with his hobby is all you need. If someone knows about Spider-Man's webbing chemicals more than you, then let them. Bottom line is, enjoy the comics as they are and if you wish to continue into something even further (like knowing everything about Spider-Man's webbing chemicals) then you are welcome to do that too.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Traditions</h2><p>The Metabarons have 4 traditions that began with the very first Metabaron.</p><li><p>Unnatural birth: This tradition is not official, but no Metabaron has had a normal birth. Some form of cloning or incest is usually the cause for the unnatural birth of a Metabaron.</p></li><li><p>Mutilation: Each Metabaron is mutilated as a child by the previous Metabaron. Sometimes it is a purposeful test of the child's resistance to pain, and other times it is done out of anger, but it always happens.</p></li><li><p>Prosthetics: As a result of the mutilation, the child always receives cybernetic replacements for whatever part of their body was ruined. The mechanical parts often have special abilities, but not always.</p></li><li><p>Patricide: To make sure that the Metabaron's progeny is worthy of replacing him, the son must defeat the father in battle and kill him. The battle can be in any form, from armed combat to dogfights. This tradition actually came from the Castaka's, but since the first Metabaron became a Castaka, they have followed it as well.</p></li><h2>Abilities of a Metabaron</h2><p>The first Metabaron was a skilled space pirate and bounty hunter long before he settled down. Once he did, he was exposed to a culture that prided itself in not using technology as advanced as the rest of the universe. To be a part of it he had to learn their ways. A large part of their mentality came from an adherence to Bushitaka, a way of living influenced by Japanese bushido. It demands victory at any cost. Even life comes secondly to victory. Since this way of living required being able to win any fight, and the people didn't use advanced technology, they became very skilled in the ways of bladed combat. Immense skill with weapons is passed on from Metabaron to Metabaron. Even when enormous psychic powers are available to the Metabaron, their fighting abilities are just as important. All of the Metabarons after Othon have inherited Honorata's psychic abilities. They are able to do such things as read and control minds, alter the physical world with psychic energy, create objects from energy, and even stop time. In addition to amazing weapon skills and psychic powers, the Metabarons implant numerous weapons into their own bodies and have been quoted as having the power to destroy galaxies.</p><h2>Metabaronic Technology</h2><p>The Metabarons posses technology that, in some cases, is more advanced than the rest of the galaxy. The majority of their equipment was created by the first Metabaron in the years after the loss of his son. The most well known pieces of Metabaronic technology are the Metabunker and the Metacraft, the Metabaron's home and vehicle. The Metabunker is basically a mobile asteroid. It looks like a hunk of rock but is filled with rooms and halls and has been the home of the Metabarons since Othon von Salzas, its builder. Among other things it has shields that can only be destroyed by a Metabaron and faster than light engines.</p><p>The Metacraft is black ship that has also belonged to the Metabarons since it was created by Othon von Salzas. It is equipped with hundreds of weapons capable of destroying planets and armor that can protect it from even the pressures of a black hole. It's the fastest ship in the known universe and appears to be semi-sentient. The current Metabaron has named it Crow.</p><p>Othon also created various weapons for planetary combat. Some of these include gunswords, mini-bombs (planet-crushing devices that can be implanted into the body), laser weapons, missiles and armor.</p><h2>History</h2><p><b>Othon: The First Metabaron</b></p><p>Othon von Salzas lived his life as a space pirate until he met Edna, the woman who would be his wife. The story of their meeting is a mystery, but they quickly fell in love. Othon gave up pirating and moved to Marmola, the planet Edna's family lived on and ruled. Edna's father, Baron Berard of Castaka, never approved of Othon, but he didn't stop his daughter from marrying him. Othon took up his new family's business of carving marble.</p><p>Marmola was a planet made entirely of marble and all the richest men came from around the galaxy to purchase finely cut marble from the Castaka's. In addition to their amazing stone cutting techniques, the Castakas had a secret. In caves beneath the planet was a blue substance called epiphyte that when placed into objects made them defy gravity. The epiphyte was used to transport the huge blocks of marble since the Castaka's didn't use very much advanced technology.</p><p>One day dignitaries from the Imperial Merchants Guild arrived on the planet and purchased some marble. While it was being cut there was an accident and tons of marble fell on Othon, trapping him. Edna knew it would take too long to cut the marble away so she demanded that her father use the epiphyte to free Othon but Berard said no, refusing to reveal the secret of the epiphyte in front of the dignitaries. Other stonecutters sided with Edna and Berard was overruled. As soon as Othon was freed and learned what had happened he was furious. He knew that revealing their secret would cause an intergalactic war when everyone found out about the epiphyte and decided they wanted it for themselves. When Berard saw Othon's anger he finally accepted him as his son, but the damage had been done.</p><p>That night, the dignitaries left with their marble and Berard held a meeting. During the meeting he and Othon took out weapons and fought. Berard took a hit to lure Othon into striking range. Berard won but spared Othon, teaching him one last lesson about sacrifice. Following their battle Berard opened his shirt and showed Othon the Castakan birthmark, a glowing white bird in the center of his chest. He said that the mark is passed down from baron to baron and said that it now belonged to Othon. Berard didn't want to be alive when the war for the epiphyte began so he willed the birthmark onto Othon's chest and held his breath until he died.</p><p>Ten days later, the battle began. Ships from all over the galaxy warred in the skies above Marmola and after a time only the Black Endoguard remained. On the planet, Othon's wife (Edna) and son (Bari) were ready to fight the entire legion of Black Endoguard warriors, an army that numbered over 4500, but Othon told them to wait. He had a plan but his family wouldn't hear it. Othon broke Bari's legs so he couldn't get out into battle but Edna got past him and ran out of the castle to be shot to pieces. After his wife's death Othon told his army the plan. He ordered his army to split into two and take the Black Endoguard from the North and South, and engage that in close combat, the specialty of Othon's people. Othon let his two best generals go into battle and attack from the sides while he went alone to combat them head on. By the end of the battle Othon had killed more than 1500 men with nothing but a dagger. After the fight, Othon paid respects to his lost friends and family and took after his son.</p><p>A week later the Imperial Couple arrived on Marmola and they worked out a deal to get the epiphyte. Othon was made obscenely rich, was given a new planet, and was gifted with the last horse in the galaxy, which he gave to his son. Bari formed a deep connection with his steed while his legs healed but one night thieves came to the planet and stole it. Bari went after them but Othon didn't think he would catch the criminals since his legs were still weak. Othon took off after them in the dense fog and killed the first three without a problem. The last one was riding away on the horse and Othon threw his spear through its chest and unhorsed the man. Othon drew closer and was horrified to see that he had killed his son. While he was grieving the last thief shot him and destroyed his pelvis. Othon killed him and was only able to make it back to his palace with the aid of his dead son's horse.</p><p>Othon got cybernetic implants to repair his damaged body (starting the metabaronic tradition of mutilation and mechanical replacements) and spent a large part of his fortune creating the first metabaronic weapons. Filled with suffering and rage after the loss of his son and inability to have another (since his destroyed reproductive organs had been replaced with machinary like the rest of his pelvic area) Othon became a violent and dangerous man. He kept his two concubines although they could not satisfy him, and they were not allowed to speak in his presence.</p><p>One night Othon heard news that the royal couple's fetus had finally been created (the emporer was sterile so the fetus had to be made in a lab on a far away planet) and that it was being transported to the royal couple. Othon new that if he had heard it then criminals and pirates would have as well and that the fetus was in danger. Sure enough the transport ship was attacked by ships launched from a hidden base disguised as a planet. The Purple Endoguard ships defending the transport ship were outnumbered and while they could hold off the attackers, they couldn't defeat them. The battle went on for weeks and the call went out for anyone with ideas to turn the tide. Othon, a brilliant strategist, had a plan immediately and flew to the golden planet where the royal couple lived. Once he landed the guards tried to stop him because he had come unannounced, but he took down any man who stood in his way and walked straight up to the royal couple. He told them his plan and was given the remaining ships of the fleet and flew to the battle. The other ships were painted to hide in an asteroid field while Othon to his ship to the planet/base and attacked it. When the enemy ships saw their base under attack they flew through the asteroids to reach Othon but where destroyed by the hidden ships. Othon then went to take his place at the head of the ships protecting the transport vessel but he was ordered to go to the back. Insulted, he flew his ship through the armored transport, stole the fetus, and flew off to the golden planet at faster-than-light speeds that no other ship had ever, or would ever, reach.</p><p>When Othon reached the golden planet and presented the royal family with their child (male and female Siamese twins joined at the back, a prophecy fulfilling child) he was knighted as Metabaron. The royal couple promised Othon a that they would search the galaxy for a gift that would fulfill him.</p><p>Some time later an imperial vessel landed on Othon's planet. His gift had arrived. Into his castle walked a woman that was to be his wife. The woman was Honorata, a priestess of Shabda-Oud. The priestesses were largely considered whores and witches so Othon was not pleased to see her at first. When he looked into her eyes though, that changed. Othon's concubines pleaded for him to kill her and said she had put a spell on him, but Othon sent them away.</p><p>Othon and Honorata soon fell madly in love but because of Othon's robotic parts, nothing could come of it. One night, during a lunar eclipse, Honorata took Othon to their room and pricked his finger with her nail telling him that he would have a child of his blood...</p><p>Nine months later Othon's servant told him that his concubines had taken Honorata to the top of the palace and were going to throw her off. He took his sons horse and rode to his armory. Loading one of his guns with a dart full of epiphyte, he ran to a ledge where he could see his concubines about to jump with his wife. As they did, Othon shot Honorata. She floated and her would-be murderers fell to their deaths. Othon got in his ship and went to pick Honorata up, but before he could she gave birth in midair. Once they were in the ship Honorata told Othon that she had given birth to a son and they named him Aghnar. She also told him that he could never tell anyone that Aghnar was a boy. She then revealed why.</p><p>Honorata had been sent chosen by the other priestesses of Shabda-Oud to be Othon's gift in order to seduce him and have a special child. She had planned on giving birth to a hermaphrodite so it would fulfill a prophecy saying that an androgynous being would one day rule the galaxy. It's father being the most dangerous man in existence would also add to its power. Fortunately, in her time with Othon she had genuinely fallen in love with him and so she gave him the son he had wanted.</p><p>Part of her plan had included kidnapping the child when it was 7 and delivering it to her masters, but now that she loved Othon, they had to figure out a way to protect his child. They settled on keeping the child's sex a secret for the seven years, hoping to have a proper plan by then. That night while they were sleeping, Aghnar started to float out of his crib. As soon as Othon realized that the epiphyte that had save Honorata's life had made his son weightless, he screamed in fury and took up a knife to kill his son, a boy that would never become a real warrior. Honorata was only able to stop him by revealing that the effort that she had used to have the boy had left her sterile, meaning that if he died, there would no chance for Othon to have another son. Honorata clamped weights on Aghnar's legs so he would be grounded and Othon decided to let him live, but said that he could not bear to see his son. Honorata agreed to take him away and train him for the seven years that were assured to them. At the end of that time they would return and Othon would test him to see if he was worthy, and if not, he would kill the boy and himself, ending the line of Metabarons before it started.</p><p>Honorata took Aghnar to the sacred mountain Anasirma. It was a forbidden and dangerous place with deadly chasms and even more deadly beasts. They found a cave of crystals and made that their home. In the cave Aghnar found and befriended a woolly toad and even taught it to speak. When Aghnar turned five, Honorata told him to kill his pet and friend. Before dying the creature asked, \"Why Master?\" and Aghnar responded, \"Duty comes before love.\" Aghnar took his sword and sliced him in two, shedding one tear as he did so. For crying, Honorata whipped him, leaving a scar that would never heal. Using Shabda-Oud meditation techniques, Aghnar learned to control his nervous system and free his body from the tyranny of pain. After this had been mastered, Honorata began to train her son in combat. She fought him at every opportunity, often ambushing him as he did routine chores. He learned never to trust anyone, not even his mother, and eventually he was no longer caught off guard when she attacked. She periodically added more weights to him to build up his strength as they trained. Honorata had superhuman strength as well as psychic abilities and he was forced to fight her every day, learning to use and defend against weapons of the body and the mind. On the day before his seventh birthday Aghnar finally beat his mother. She clad him in armor and gave him a sword, telling him that the next day he would meet his father. Riding a winged beast, Aghnar and Honorata returned to Othon and his castle.</p><p>Othon had decided to pit his son against a robo-killer, a nearly indestructible machine with eight blade covered arms. The only way to destroy it was by avoiding the arms and setting off its self-destruct mechanism. The battle lasted for over an hour but Aghnar eventually won. Othon was displeased because Aghnar had used his flying abilities so he devised another test. He put his sons legs in a device that would squeeze them until Aghnar told it to stop. It was horrible test of strength of will and pain tolerance, but Aghnar passed, not protesting once until his legs were completely removed. After the ordeal, Othon grafted robotic legs to his sons body, finally giving him real weight and making him a Metabaron.</p><p>Soon after that, three priestesses of the Shabda-Oud arrived to inspect Othon's son. Aghnar killed all three of them but their ship was still in orbit. The thing was a cetacyborg, a creature made of flesh, magic and technology that was capable of destroying worlds. Othon took his ship to space to fight the monster ship but he found it to be indestructible. The only way he could to see to beat it was to attack from inside of it. He flew inside the beasts mouth and headed for its brain. Even that was nearly impossible though since the cetacyborg's body produced destructive acids capable of eating through his ship. By the time he reached the brain much of his ship had been eroded and he was practically drinking in the monster's acid by the mouthful. He eventually killed the beast and made it out but his lungs had been corroded and he was coughing up blood.</p><p>When Othon returned to the planet he loaded up the Metabunker and was preparing to take his family to another planet when Honorata revealed that she couldn't go with him. The Priestesses had implanted a micro-H bomb in her heart so if she ever betrayed them whatever planet she was on would be destroyed. She knew that it would soon explode but she hadn't wanted to slow Othon down so she hadn't told him about the bomb until right when he was leaving. Othon was forced to take his son and leave his wife, but he vowed to get revenge on the Shabda-Oud.</p><p>The Metabunker landed on the planet Perdita, a place with extreme gravity, enormous insects and floating apes. On the planet, Othon told Aghnar that he had spy-needles all over the universe that would tell him where the Shabda-Oud planet was, but it would be ten years before the signals would reach Perdita. That meant that Aghnar had ten years to prepare to face the witches of the Shabda-Oud. At that point, Othon told Aghnar that he would have to kill him. The acid in Othon's body would kill him in a few days but he wanted Aghnar to kill him before then. It would prove to Othon that Aghnar was truly worthy of being the next Metabaron. At first Aghnar refused but when Othon attacked he was forced to defend himself. Aghnar used the mental powers his mother had gifted him to paralyze his father but Othon told him that he had oko mini-bombs implanted all over his body and they would detonate if Aghnar touched him the wrong way. Aghnar reasoned that Othon couldn't have bombs in his brain if he could think properly, so he drove his weapon through his father's skull and killed him.</p><p><b>Aghnar: The Second Metabaron</b></p>",

The Quickening can only be released from the body after decapitation, once this happens the Quickening is absorbed into the victor, or the nearest Immortal if the decapitation happened by accident or by mortal means. </p> <p>Quickening\u2019s are massively destructive, though the extent of the devastation is dependent on how old and how powerful the immortal is.  During the episode \u201cComes a Horseman\u201d, Duncan MacLeod and Methos received a shared Quickening that almost completely destroyed a factory from two characters that were over 3000 years old, but during Endgame, Duncan MacLeod received a Quickening so powerful it cleared the atmosphere of clouds and destroyed a major power plant in New York, this Quickening was from Jacob Kell who was just over 600 years old. <br /><br /></p><h3>Dark Quickening</h3>If an Immortal received too many Quickening\u2019s from \u2018evil\u2019 Immortals, then the build up can eventually overcome the immortals psyche and turn them into a dark, twisted version of themselves. This happened to Duncan MacLeod in season 4 of the television when an Immortal Native American named Coltec was eventually overwhelmed by the Dark Quickening. Duncan MacLeod eventually killed Coltec and received the Dark Quickening himself, he was eventually saved by Methos, though the cost was great, as during his \u2018Dark Time\u2019 Duncan had killed one of his oldest friends, Dean Burns.<br /><br /><h3>Light Quickening</h3>As with the Dark Quickening, the same can happen in reverse to an \u2018evil\u2019 immortal. Darius was an ancient  immortal warlord who roamed the world searching for Immortals, when he came to Paris he was faced with an Immortal monk who protected Paris. Darius slew the immortal and received his Quickening, the pure, Light Quickening overcame Darius\u2019 psyche and since then he dedicated his life to the church and spent the next thousand years on holy ground.<br /><br /><h3>Holy Ground Quickenings</h3>One of the three rules for Immortals, there must be no fighting on Holy Ground. This rule has been broken twice in Highlander cannon, both times with disastrous consequences.<p>In 79AD two immortals fought in a temple on Pompeii, when the final stroke fell the volcano erupted from the Quickening, killing the immortal victor as well. In 1993, Connor Macleod faced Kane in a Buddhist shrine, when Kane went to make the killing blow Connor blocked him with his Katana and went to finish the fight, Connor\u2019s sword shattered to dust before making the blow. Rather than attack a defenceless man on holy ground, Kane wisely chose to save the fight for later.</p>",

Ripclaw, Cyblade, and Velocity are spin-offs of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marc-silvestri/26-15688/\">Marc Silvestri</a>\u2019s popular series, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyberforce/65-25321/\">Cyber Force</a>. The Angelus is a concept that originated in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkness/49-5868/\">The Darkness</a>, another Silvestri creation, while Necromancer had appeared in a previous miniseries from Top Cow in 2005. All the characters were established and made up a connected, shared world, whereas Aphrodite IX was set in the future. </p>\n<p>The voting process was well received, exceeding four million votes over the course of one month (from December until January). Readers were permitted, and encouraged, to vote as many times as they wanted.&nbsp;<br />Cyblade and Velocity tied for first place, and both titles were slated for an ongoing series in 2008. However, only Cyblade was released on schedule. After suffering many delays, Velocity writer Casey resumed work again, this time with artist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chriscross/26-6210/\">ChrisCross </a>relieving Maguire. The title hit another impasse when ChrisCross resigned from the project in Dec. 2008 due to \u201cunforeseen differences\u201d; the title was officially cancelled in February 2009. Casey later attributed the delay and cancellation to Top Cow\u2019s poor management, citing mass dismissal of Top Cow personnel, including editorial staff. Velocity was finally re-launched in 2010 with a new creative team, despite being published under the Pilot Season banner. The new series is written by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ron-marz/26-41799/\">Ron Marz</a> with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kenneth-rocafort/26-43123/\">Kenneth Rocafort </a>providing art. </p>\n<p>&nbsp; </p>\n<h2>2008 Season</h2>\n<p>This season saw a change in that all the entrants were original characters, with only two having a publication history before Pilot Season. </p><br />\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/twilight-guardian-pilot-season/49-21600/\">Twilight Guardian</a></h3>Writer: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/troy-hickman/26-43135/\">Troy Hickman</a> <br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/troy-hickman/26-43135/\"></a>Artist: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/reza/26-55021/\">Reza</a> <br /><br />\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-pendragon-pilot-season/49-21783/\">Lady Pendragon</a></h3>Writer: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-hawkins/26-48784/\">Matt Hawkins</a> <br />Artist: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eru/26-55681/\">Eru</a> <br />\n<p>&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alibi-pilot-season/49-21866/\">Alibi</a></p>Writer: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joshua-hale-fialkov/26-43698/\">Joshua Hale Fialkov <br /></a>Artist: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jeremy-haun/26-52492/\">Jeremy Haun</a> <br /><br />\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genius-pilot-season/49-21813/\">Genius</a></h3>Writer: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marc-bernardin/26-55686/\">Marc Bernardin </a>&amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-freeman/26-55687/\">Adam Freeman</a> <br />Artist: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/afua-richardson-lakota-sioux/26-55688/\">Afua Richardson</a> <br /><br />\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pilot-season-the-core/49-22409/\">The Core</a></h3>Writer: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jonathan-hickman/26-45065/\">Jonathan Hickman</a> <br />Artist: Kenneth Rocafort <br /><br />\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/urban-myths-pilot-season/49-21984/\">Urban Myths</a></h3>Writer: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jay-faerber/26-43752/\">Jay Faerber</a> <br />Artist: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jorge-molina/26-52598/\">Jorge Molina</a> <br /><br />\n<p>The voting period this season lasted from August to September 2008, and allowing individual computers to vote only once per a day.

Some consider them mutants nonetheless while others consider them to be separate species altogether because they are technically not \"human mutants\" like the rest of the 198. These mutant hybrids include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ariel/29-41840/\">Ariel</a> (not actually <i>homo superior</i>, but an extraterrestrial mutant)</li><li><a href=\"/adam-x-treme/29-15108/\">Adam X</a> : Shi'ar hybrid</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crosta/29-63222/\">Crosta</a> : homo mermanus superior</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lifeguard/29-5002/\">Lifeguard</a> : Shi'ar hybrid</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">McKenzie, Namor</a> : homo mermanus superior</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namora/29-2177/\">Namora</a> : Aquaria Neptunia; homo mermanus superior</li><li><a href=\"/paradigm/29-15574/\">Paradigm</a> : mutant merged with the Phalanx</li></ul>",

These beings came to be known as Ultras, the most popular and well-known of which was Ultraforce. The other sources of super-powers in the Ultraverse were magic, the nanotech \"wetware\" developed by the hidden civilization of the underground-dwelling Fire People, or simply from being an alien from another planet or universe. Scientific analysis of these Ultras allowed some of these aspects to be artificially copied or genetically spliced into various human beings.</p><a></a><h2>Behind the Scenes</h2><p>The Ultraverse was fairly successful at first, even producing a short-lived Ultraforce cartoon TV series. But when Marvel Comics bought out Malibu, the Ultraverse was radically redesigned. In the event that would come to be known as \"Black September\" (or B.S., to most fans) the entire continuity was rebooted. Some characters where changed or retconned out of existence, many series were cancelled, and (big surprise) heroes visiting from the Marvel Universe came to dominate the remaining books.

Although most believe his book <a href=\"/invincible/29-5210/\">                        Invincible</a> started the universe it was actually Tech Jacket. The Kirkmanverse is primarily composed of heroes who have appeared in books he has written under Image.

Today even books he does not write, such as the past <a href=\"/brit/29-5212/\">                        Brit</a> series, are included in Kirkmanverse continuity.</p><a> </a><h2>Appearances</h2><p>There is some dispute as to who actually is in the Kirkmanverse. Even if Invincible appears in another character's book, that character isn't it the universe unless he or she has actually appeared in one of Kirkman's book.

The most commonly thought of mutants are the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> and almost every other character involved in their stories, as the entire Homo Superior race are mutants. Another team of mutants are the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, even though they received there powers from cosmic radiation and are often referred to as mutates. They are mutants in the fact that they have been mutated, however it must be made clear that they are not a part of the Homo Superior race.</p><p>Another group that is considered to be in the same condition except they received their powers from gamma radiation rather than cosmic are the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gamma-corps/65-44860/\">Gamma Corps</a> and all the mutates their DNA is based off of, mainly the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> would also fall under this list as they receive their superpowers from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">Terrigen Mists</a> as well as their special genetic makeup. An honorable mention to this array of mutants is Marvel's flagship character, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> who was mutated by the bite of a radioactive spider, allowing him to take on the creature's capabilities. As for the DC Universe, one of the actually referred to as being a mutant is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-comet/29-30559/\">Captain Comet</a> whose latent mutancy was activated by a passing comet...100,000 years before his time. Another prominent mutant is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> whose mutancy is caused partially because of the genetic physiology of a Kryptonian as well as the effects of the Earth's yellow sun.</p><h3><b>Objects</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"719333\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/719333-544972_ring_green_2007_12_26001copy_large_super.jpg\" title=\"The Powerful Green Power Ring of the Green Lantern Corps\"><img id=\"719333\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/719333-544972_ring_green_2007_12_26001copy_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Powerful Green Power Ring of the Green Lantern Corps\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Powerful Green Power Ring of the Green Lantern Corps</div></div></div></div><p>Many heroes are also human, or at least considered weaker than average, and for that reason they possess artifacts (either mystical in nature or quite ordinary) that can be both technological or magical. They are used to augment one's powers and can be used as formidable weapons.</p><p>One of the most famous heroes who uses an object to gain all of his powers is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> who uses various armors he has created. However an object can also be used to augment preexisting powers such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a> is, in the case of the already formidable <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>. Professor X half brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Cain</a>also known as the Juggernaut possess an item which gives him the powers of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a>. The object is known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/18-41533/\">Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a>. This gem varies from different places and origins but in order to wield its power you must read an incantation on the gem itself.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"730584\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/730584-273399_70540_cosmic_staff_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Staff\"><img id=\"730584\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/730584-273399_70540_cosmic_staff_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Staff\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Staff</div></div></div></div><p>Other objects such as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinity-gems/18-41041/\">Infinity Gems</a> can give their wielder unimaginable power, whether those that use them have any superpowers or not. Sometimes an entire team of super humans, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exemplars/65-42127/\">Exemplars</a> for example, are composed of those who are bestowed with powers thanks to mystical artifacts. Others wield objects that are not necessarily needed yet have become a symbol, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-americas-shield/18-50737/\">Captain America's Shield</a>. Other times it is the object that chooses the user, such as the rings of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-sapphire/18-47349/\">Star Sapphire</a> and all other similar teams in the DC Universe.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> is another hero whose weapons symbolize her, the <a href=\"/lasso-of-truth/18-41435/\">Lasso of Truth</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-womans-tiara/18-51489/\">Tiara</a> and her <a href=\"/wonder-womans-bracelets/18-51517/\">Bracelets</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">Hawkgirl</a> also is another hero that has a mace of Nth metal found on her planet that has the ability to give electrical charges, hurt magical items, people or things, and is also very rare and in certain phases can be highly dangerous. Also, on a rare occasion, an object can be such a thing as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\">Emerald Eye of Ekron</a> in which the object is actually a portion of someone's being even though its wielded by another. Other universes besides Marvel and DC use objects to power their main characters including Dark Horse. In the Star Wars comics, the lightsaber is a mighty weapon that is original for every wielder but is used by both the Jedi and the Sith. Yet the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lightsaber/18-44097/\">lightsaber</a>, though it supplies its wielder with superpowers, can only be used properly by those who have a connection with <a href=\"http://the%20force/12-50253/%C2%A0%C2%A0The\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Force</a>, a superpower in and of itself. In Top Cow, a mystical artifact known as the Witchblade has survived for countless years, being wielded by generations of women, the most prominent being <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sara-pezzini/29-18318/\">Sara Pezzini</a>.</p><h3>Divinity</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"730607\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/730607-215337_167124_galactus_large_super.jpg\" title=\"The Godly Galactus\"><img id=\"730607\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/730607-215337_167124_galactus_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Godly Galactus\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Godly Galactus</div></div></div></div><p>Those who possess superpowers yet are neither doing this through technological means or mutations are usually cosmic beings or those who have received their powers from these divine beings. The basic ones are the five siblings that represent the universe <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinity/29-11333/\">Infinity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oblivion/29-2496/\">Oblivion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eternity/29-11332/\">Eternity</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/death/29-12620/\">Death</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>.</p><p>Another group of divine beings is the Octessence comprised of the eight beings who would grant their power to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exemplars/65-42127/\">Exemplars</a> through mystical artifacts. These beings usually recruit others to serve them, some of their more famous heralds or servants include <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doorman/29-2489/\">Doorman</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a>. Also, the one \"mortal\" who was promised he would witness the End of the Universe also falls into this category, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-immortal/29-2486/\">Mr. Immortal</a>. On the DC side of the spectrum the biggest groups would be the <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/65-42494/\">Wonder Family</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>'s powers are drawn from the blessings of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/olympian-gods/65-55708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gods of Olympus</a>, although <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>'s powers are as a result of her birth, <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a>'s are blessings from the <a href=\"/titans-of-myth/65-54301/\">Titans of Myth</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a> is result of being the daughter of <a href=\"/zeus/29-5306/\">Zeus</a>. And the other biggest group would be the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-family/65-19240/\">Marvel Family</a>, the champions of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shazam/29-2365/\">Shazam</a>. Yet, two of the most powerful entities are both connected to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/god/29-10526/\">God</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-stranger/29-3298/\">Phantom Stranger</a> who is believed to be repaying God for his transgressions. The other is considered to be one of the mightiest wielders of magic in the Universe, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spectre/29-2361/\">Spectre</a>. The demonic powers of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mephisto/29-2635/\">Mephisto</a> depend very much on his location as even though he is at full power in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hell/34-42471/\">Hell</a>, his powers wane if he is absent from his throne for too long.</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>One way in which one uses superpowers, or is able to display them is through the use of magic. This includes the ability to control or influence the natural world including events, objects, people, and physical phenomena through mystical, paranormal or supernatural means. A variety of beings practice magic, and they are different types allowing different effects. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> for example has received such powers longevity, the ability to hypnotize, necromancy, levitation, illusion casting and telepathy from his mastery of the mystic arts. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> is capable of sensing mysticism and of performing astral projection thanks to her sorcery. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> is also a powerful magic user and can create constructs from energy, however he had decided to replicate most of his magical abilities with technology.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"731811\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/731811-92665_30894_doctor_strange_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Suprem\"><img id=\"731811\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/731811-92665_30894_doctor_strange_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Suprem\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Doctor Strange: The Sorcerer Suprem</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amanda-sefton/29-10970/\">Amanda Sefton</a>'s magical abilities allow her to teleport, cast illusions and a multitude of other things. The magic of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> coupled with her insanity has caused her to manipulate reality on occasion. In the DC Universe there exists a race known as Homo Magi, one of the most prominent members of this race is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zatanna/29-5691/\">Zatanna</a> whose magic is capable of performing any feat. Another renown magic wielder is the anti-hero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-adam/29-4916/\">Black Adam</a> whose connection with the Rock of Eternity allows him to possess the powers of the gods. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> is another hero whose magic weapons symbolize her, they are often what people think of, as they are all a part of her attire, including her the <a href=\"/lasso-of-truth/18-41435/\">Lasso of Truth</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-womans-tiara/18-51489/\">Tiara</a> and her <a href=\"/wonder-womans-bracelets/18-51517/\">Bracelets</a> are all magic based blessings of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/olympian-gods/65-55708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gods of Olympus</a>. <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a>, use magic based items as well.</p><p>There are also teams of magic users such as<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadowpact/65-40387/\">Shadowpact</a>, a team of heroes who fight the supernatural. Then there are the supernatural themselves such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon/29-7367/\">Demon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zauriel/29-6902/\">Zauriel</a> whose magic knows no bounds. Another team of nigh-omnipotent magicians and sorcerers is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels-of-magic/65-40386/\">Sentinels of Magic</a>, a team that fights for justice. One of the great magic users of the DC Universe is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-fate/29-5898/\">Doctor Fate</a> who is powered by the mystical Helmet of Nabu, which allows him to do nearly limitless wonders. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/raven/29-3584/\">Raven</a> is half-demon which is why she possesses magical powers that allow her to perform telepathy, telekinesis, astral projection and concussive blasts.</p><h2><b>Manipulation of Superhuman Attributes</b></h2><h3><b>Power Duplication</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"410970\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/410970-Pixie14_super.jpg\" title=\"Mimic: The Ultimate Power Mimicker\"><img id=\"410970\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/410970-Pixie14_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mimic: The Ultimate Power Mimicker\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mimic: The Ultimate Power Mimicker</div></div></div></div><p>The ability to duplicate another's power is usually limited to a certain amount of individuals such as in the case of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mimic/29-12546/\">Mimic</a> who can only take on the power of five individuals in his vicinity, however in his case though he can duplicate another's power, he can only use half of their power and unlike many others the powers mimicked permanently remain with him. Others such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/synch/29-10576/\">Synch</a> have the power to \"synch\" with another, allowing him to gain all their full capabilities. This means that even though Chamber did not know he could fly using his powers, Synch used the powers to their full potential and found that he could. Then others like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> use genetics so that they can extract DNA of a superhuman individual and can use it to bestow powers upon both himself and others.</p><p>Others with similar abilities include <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pandemic/29-42336/\">Pandemic</a> who devised a serum that has granted him the ability to manifest the abilities of any mutant he has ever come into contact with. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amazo/29-3737/\">Amazo</a>, the android, has at times had himself hardwired so that he can copy the abilities of any source near to him, the amount of those he could was never specified and was seemingly limitless. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/serafina/29-43771/\">Serafina</a> uses technology to connect herself to both technological and biological entities, allowing her to take on the capabilities of meta humans she connects with. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gideon/29-2162/\">Gideon</a>, an immortal had the ability to take on the attributes of anyone in his vicinity, making him a very deadly threat as years had helped him hone his ability. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> can also \"duplicate\" a power through the sense of touch, if her skin comes into contact with that of another she absorbs their skills, sometimes permanently other times temporarily, the drawback is this touch also harms the one who she touches. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-alice/29-41210/\">Black Alice</a> is a mystic who has the power to steal the mystical capabilities of anyone she chooses, leaving them powerless, however unless she can see them, the power will choose a random target. A power mimicker named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peter-petrelli/29-47678/\">Peter Petrelli</a> is far more powerful than many others with similar powers to him. His use of other's superpowers is called empathic power mimicry as he can use the power of anyone he has ever met if he remembers how they made him feel.

This can be from immortality all the way down to merely being able to heal from a cut at twice the speed of a normal human. Healing also can mean that it takes one longer to age, gives them immunity to disease and poisons as well as easier capabilities to survive extreme heat and cold. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> is one of the most famed healers, mostly because of the fact that these abilities have allowed him to survive for centuries and combined with his adamantium nearly make him immortal.

Some of the most powerful powerhouses in the Marvel Universe, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, have both been at one point reduced to a mere skeleton...yet they retained no injuries and healed in almost no time at all. Then there is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> who was healed when manifesting his Healing Factor, but also permanently disfigured. Also there is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Icarus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> who are believed to be members of the Cheyarafim, meaning they have healing blood that will keep them alive...as long as their wings remain a part of their body. Finally, as another representative of the Marvel Universe there is the multiple-powered <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> who has been shown as being capable of healing from Cyclops' optic blasts. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/godzilla/29-21599/\">Godzilla</a>, a monster meant to represent man's mistakes, has special cells that heal so fast that it is nearly impossible to harm let alone kill him.

This is a rare power and yet oddly enough, one single (short-lived) team had two members with this power, it was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-statix/65-11485/\">X-Statix</a>. However that team was comprised of misfits and the like, which hints at the fact that this is a seemingly unwanted ability. One of the two was the team's leader, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anarchist/29-12913/\">Anarchist</a>, whose power was acidic sweat. His teammate, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zeitgeist/29-15531/\">Zeitgeist</a> also was unfortunately burdened with this superpower. So he found himself able to spew an acid from his mouth, that could allegedly allow him to eat anything he desired, as it would break down the materials. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-thing/29-4988/\">Man-Thing</a> also possesses this ability however it is acids that are secreted from his body and can cause intense burns.</p><h3><b>Animal Mimicry</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"90897\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1953/90897-2847-vixen_super.jpg\" title=\"Vixen: One With Nature\"><img id=\"90897\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1953/90897-2847-vixen_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Vixen: One With Nature\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vixen: One With Nature</div></div></div></div><p>Animal Man is the prime example of someone who bears this power, as he can take on the abilities of any animal on Earth thanks to an object from the depths of space.</p><p>Vixen also can mimic animals, as she wears a mystical Tantu Totem which grants her the ability to take on the characteristics of any animal.</p><p>Though this ability usually allows its \"bearer\" to have all the powers of everyone else it takes away from specialization and so even though they have all the individual powers they are not gifted with such levels of power as super-beings like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>.</p><h3>Biological Manipulation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"747043\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11768/747043-x_forcecable_messiah_war_event_20090324024140863_super.jpg\" title=\"Elixir: Healer or Killer?\"><img id=\"747043\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11768/747043-x_forcecable_messiah_war_event_20090324024140863_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Elixir: Healer or Killer?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Elixir: Healer or Killer?</div></div></div></div><p>This is defined as the ability to manipulate life itself, through a nearly limitless amount of effects though the basics of the power is just altering one's DNA.

To manipulate life also means to sustain it such as healing others with your touch, either from a small cut or even a removal of the heart. Things that would not naturally heal can also be cured (or bestowed) such as diseases or mental illnesses. The power can also be reversed as to manipulating life to the extent that it brings about death.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sersi/29-2118/\">Sersi</a> is renown amongst the Eternals as being the most-skilled manipulator of matter, this includes both organic and inorganic matter meaning she can rearrange it on a whim.

This includes, but is not limited to, the generation of new bone mass to replenish ones that are projected out from the skin. This projection is usually in the form razor sharp projectiles capable of doing an extent of damage or even as bones which can be used as blunt weapons such as plates or spikes and even more complicated forms. It also can allow the rearrangement of one's own bones and makes the bearer of this power stronger due to the fact that their bones can become much denser than normal humans and heal faster as well as form a personal armor around the user to protect them from harm. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kimimaro/29-44262/\">Kimimaro</a> is a prime example of bone manipulation as he has utter control of his entire skeletal structure. He is capable of removing bones from his body and within seconds the skin that was torn is healed and a new bone takes its place. He can then use these bones as weapons most commonly by firing them from his hands.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spyke/29-47514/\">Spyke</a> from the X-Men Evolution comics has the power to control his bones as well, from forming protective bone plates around himself or even lighting his own bones on fire. However, two drawbacks include that he can never fully retract a projected bone and he needs to regain all the calcium he loses when using this power. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bling/29-40669/\">Bling!</a> is capable of a \"one-of-a-kind\" type of bone manipulation in which her bone marrow produces a crystalline substance that coats her body, making it more durable, this substance can also be projected at high velocities. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quill/29-41149/\">Quill</a> is also capable of projecting or extending spikes from his body, however these spikes seem to simply be attached to his body rather than a part of it. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marrow/29-13726/\">Marrow</a> is perhaps the most thought of example of someone who can manipulate bones, even though originally she could not control this power, it has allowed her to become almost immune to harm yet at the same time have an amazing healing factor. An oddity with Marrow is that she possessed two hearts to make up for her extremely peculiar bone growth. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/absalom/29-14188/\">Absalom</a> , one of the immortal mutants, was capable of growing razor-sharp bone spines that protrude from his skin.</p><h3><b>Duplication</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"731817\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/731817-503935_xfact037_cov_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Madrox: The Multiplying Man\"><img id=\"731817\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/731817-503935_xfact037_cov_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Madrox: The Multiplying Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Madrox: The Multiplying Man</div></div></div></div><p>This refers to the ability of creating duplicates of oneself (usually tangible but not always), though sometimes these duplicates are free-thinking beings, other times they work with their \"creator\". A common theme among those who can duplicate is that they can reabsorb their duplicates and with them all their memories and skills. Also, in most cases at least, when a duplicate is harmed or killed, the original being is left unscathed from the event. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/damian-tryp/29-40708/\">Damian Tryp</a> is a mysterious man who possesses various abilities, one of which is to duplicate, however he capable of temporal duplication, as in bringing past and future selves throughout the time stream. This act is referred to as temporal duplication because it is creating duplicates of oneself through chronokinesis, or the manipulation of tempus/time. In the far-off future of the DC Universe, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/triplicate-girl/29-1262/\">Triplicate Girl</a>, a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes has the ability to create two clones of herself with whom she can assimilate herself as to gain their abilities and knowledge. Angela Spica, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/engineer/29-17607/\">Engineer</a>, is capable of using the nanotechnology that grants her superhuman abilities to make copies of herself. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Bart Allen</a> has a unique ability granted by the Speed Force that only he possesses of the four Flashes. And that is with the Speed Force he can create clones of himself, however, the death of one nearly killed Bart so he refrained from using the power again before his death. In the world of Naruto, the focal character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/29-44238/\">Naruto</a> as well as almost any other character is capable of creating 'shadow clones' which are seemingly tangible reflections of oneself. They seem to be real but if they come into physical contact with someone/something that intends to destroy them they are hit and become smoke. Naruto was originally considered a failure because he could not do the Shadow Clone Technique but eventually he became a master of it and was renown for his skills in using it. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madrox/29-7910/\">Madrox</a>, the Multiple Man, is the child of \"unknown origins\" who gains a duplicate every time kinetic energy is released upon his body. He is unable to control these duplicates, however he can reabsorb them and retain all their memories and skills. He is able to have his duplicates killed without he himself being harmed, the only side effect is then he cannot absorb a dead duplicate.</p><h3>Echolocation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"682716\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/682716-dd118_cvr_super.jpg\" title=\"Daredevil: The Man Without Fear\"><img id=\"682716\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/682716-dd118_cvr_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Daredevil: The Man Without Fear\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Daredevil: The Man Without Fear</div></div></div></div><p>Echolocation, sometimes referred to as a sonar or radar sense, is one of the few superpowers that has actually been achieved in the real world by living organisms, however those organisms are not human, rather they are bats. Echolocation is basically sound waves hitting objects and being sent back to someone or something that can sense the differentiations so clearly that it will allow them to see objects as clear as if there were no interference.</p><p>Very few possess this power and the two well-known users are about as different as could possibly be imagined. The more popular of the two, Marvel's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> is utterly blind and so echolocation has replaced his sight and thus made it better. He must have sound, but unlike a bat the sound can come from anywhere in his vicinity. The other individual is from DC Comics and is known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-bat/29-6131/\">Man-Bat</a> who is like a man/bat hybrid.

The power of invisibility can be granted through many means and can have many different levels, despite the idea that all invisibles are the same. The power is commonly just a side ability amongst the most powerful of beings, however it usually only reaches its true potential in those who have it as their only power. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-46234/\">Black Widow</a> a Golden Age villainess was granted numerous powers by Satan, one of which was invisibility. Another way for one to receive the power of invisibility is to be born with it, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a> is from a race of Green Martians that all possess powers that would make them seem omnipotent to the general populace of Earth, and one of those powers is invisibility. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miss-martian/29-41145/\">Miss Martian</a>, though of a different race than J'onn as she is a White Martian, still possesses all of his abilities. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gentleman-ghost/29-18358/\">Gentleman Ghost</a>, the spirit of a highway man from more than a century ago, he uses his powers of invisibility and intangibility to wreak havoc in the DC Universe. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadman/29-5690/\">Deadman</a>, another incorporeal spirit in the DC Universe also has the powers of invisibility and intangibility, however he fights for justice. Then there is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aztek/29-11280/\">Aztek</a>, a man trained for a single purpose...to destroy one of the most powerful super weapons ever conceived, to perform this feat he was given a variety of powers including invisibility. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blackheart/29-14728/\">Blackheart</a>, the nigh-omnipotent son of Mephistopheles is another one of those \"superior beings\" that can become invisible at will. A vampiric-like mutant called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emplate/29-10579/\">Emplate</a> can also become \"invisible\" as he can shift through dimensions, allowing him to walk in ours without actually being a part of it and thus unseen. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peter-petrelli/29-47678/\">Peter Petrelli</a>, a young man with the ability of empathic power mimicry was trained to use his powers by \"Claude Rains the Invisible Man\" and as such he himself became very skilled in making himself and things around him invisible. Originating in the Teen Titans animated series, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-x/29-49428/\">Red X</a> possesses a power suit that can allow him to cloak himself, becoming invisible. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/violet-parr/29-52813/\">Violet Parr</a>, a character created for the movie The Incredibles, possesses both invisibility and the power to create energy shields, a combination of powers that make it clear she was based off of Invisible Girl. Another invisibility \"copycat\" is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-skrull/29-21332/\">Super-Skrull</a> who was genetically changed so that he possessed the powers of all the Fantastic Four including Invisible Woman. Then of course there is the most famed invisible, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> herself. Like mentioned as Violet's powers, Susan Storm can become invisible by bending rays of light around herself and can also make energy fields that cannot be penetrated though enough force can cause her to no longer be able to keep them up.</p><h3>Invulnerability</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"719344\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/719344-644184_colossus_large_super.jpg\" title=\"The Invulnerable Colossus\"><img id=\"719344\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/719344-644184_colossus_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Invulnerable Colossus\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Invulnerable Colossus</div></div></div></div><p>Invulnerability is the power Ability to withstand various forms or strengths of physical damage or injury though usually there is still limits. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> is an example of a super being whose appearance must suffer for them to possess a superpower as it is Ben Grimm's rock-like skin that will allow him to remain uninjured even when shot at by armor piercing rounds. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-2350/\">Captain Marvel</a> can withstand vast amounts of physical force thanks to the powers granted to him by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shazam/29-2365/\">Shazam</a>, specifically his Stamina of Atlas. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> like all Eternals, possesses superhuman durability but of course that is the least of his powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a>, the female variation of her well- known cousin The Hulk, Jennifer Walters gains superhuman durability whenever she goes into her She-Hulk form. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a> have a very high level of invulnerability, but is vulnerable to projectiles (such as bullets) forcing her to use her bracelets to deflect them if she wishes not to suffer harm. Like all Kryptonians, when in the presence of Earth's yellow sun, <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> gain a variety of powers including an invulnerability that can easily withstand gunfire. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a>, one of the most powerful beings in the Marvel Universe is another example of an \"omnipotent hero\" that can seemingly never be harmed thanks to his invulnerability. The armored <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> gains invulnerability from the nigh-impenetrable armor his mutancy allows him to create so that he can protect himself from harm. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>, one of the mightiest specimens of the New Gods race, he has an invulnerability on par with Superman. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-majestic/29-21972/\">Mr. Majestic</a> is also a being of true power, who possesses a high level of invulnerability, but even if he is injured his regenerative healing will soon restore himself.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, has an invulnerability that may be different in itself from the majority of other beings with superpowers. As he has an incredibly powerful healing factor that has restored him from a skeleton in mere seconds, so it has been assumed that his invulnerability is actually a healing factor so fast that it deceives the eye to think he was never injured. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> however is the epitome of invulnerability, bestowed with Cyttorak's power he can put up a force field that is nigh-impenetrable and only the strongest of magics can get through, however all harm that is taken upon himself is healed instantaneously. Thanks to the stamina of Shu, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-adam/29-4916/\">Black Adam</a> is almost utterly invulnerable, enough so that swords easily shatter upon his body, most weapons make their users attempts futile, even a special bullet crafted from the Rock of Eternity. The superhuman durability of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gladiator/29-4653/\">Gladiator</a> allows him to effortlessly withstand the effects of concussive blasts, high caliber bullets and even the heat of a supernova or the vacuum of space. The durability of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/puck/29-5010/\">Puck</a> has been compared to compressed rubber and allows him to survive explosions and high caliber bullets despite his small size. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>'s invulnerability has changed throughout his many incarnations. Originally nothing less than a bursting shell could pierce his skin, later he became able to fly into the core of the sun and emerge unharmed and though it has weakened since then it is still very powerful. The Image character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brit/29-5212/\">Brit</a>, also posses invulnerability he can withstand being attacked by super powered people and survive, but unlike most character's with this power, he does not poses any super strength. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saint-of-killers/29-10522/\">Saint Of Killers</a> possesses an invulnerability that is perhaps a step beyond any of the aforementioned individuals as he has survived such things as being hit with a nuclear missile in the chest and emerging without a scratch.</p><h3>Kinetic Absorption</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"411001\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411001-Rogue4-1_super.jpg\" title=\"Sebastian Shaw: The Black King\"><img id=\"411001\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411001-Rogue4-1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sebastian Shaw: The Black King\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sebastian Shaw: The Black King</div></div></div></div><p>Sometimes referred to as inertia absorption, it is the ability to take in forms of kinetic energy. This energy then becomes a part of the being who usually converts it into superhuman strength, durability and/or growing in size. The energy can be stored within one's body, though for how long this can be done is a variating factor. In Marvel's Ultimate Universe, Lord <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a> is a valiant foe and proved his power when cops shot at him with relentless gunfire. As a response, he merely absorbed the energy, enhanced his strength, enhanced his size and made his durability all the stronger. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maelstrom/29-2493/\">Maelstrom</a>'s energy manipulating powers no next to no bounds and with them he is able to absorb kinetic energy (up to magnificent levels) and can transform it into either energy blasts or simply using it to further augment his powers. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/growing-man/29-2266/\">Growing Man</a> android is immune to physical harm as it will simply absorb any forms of kinetic energy that are directed at itself, though too much power has been shown to damage the android before. This will then cause its cells to replicate at such a speed that the android grows in size, its strength increasing at the same time. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maverick/29-8307/\">Maverick</a>, a member of the Homo Superior race, has the power to absorb and then store kinetic energy into his body taking almost no damage at all. He can then release this energy either in the form of concussive blasts or use it to increase his strength up to ten times its original limit. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/strong-guy/29-7599/\">Strong Guy</a> is X-Factor's strong guy and is superhumanly strong, however if he comes into contact with kinetic energy he will temporarily increase his strength based on the amount of energy. However, this strength must then be released within fifty seconds or it will leave him deformed, as his muscles get larger as he gets stronger. This increase of muscle mass also provides more durability and as such makes gunfire harmless to him. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">Sebastian Shaw</a> is renown for his power to absorb kinetic energy (as well as electrical) and then store it up so that it can build up continuously. His strategies often involve him taking punches or hits so that his reserves will be fully powered and he can then release the energy increasing his strength, speed and stamina to much greater levels.</p><h3>Matter Ingestion</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"77061\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/124/77061-55524-matter-eater-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Matter-Eater Lad Eating A Fence\"><img id=\"77061\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/124/77061-55524-matter-eater-lad_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Matter-Eater Lad Eating A Fence\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Matter-Eater Lad Eating A Fence</div></div></div></div><p>Matter Ingestion refers to possessing the ability to ingest any (or at least many) forms of matter, many that would normally be indigestible, without receiving any repercussions. The most popular of these limited amount of characters is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matter-eater-lad/29-3598/\">Matter-Eater Lad</a>, he is often considered as having a humorous yet useless power but it proved to be enough to get him membership into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion Of Super-Heroes</a>. His powers allow him to eat any material, in any quantity without any need of slowing down whereas a normal human would have to wait for it to digest. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/calorie-queen/29-28488/\">Calorie Queen</a>, who is basically a female counterpart of Matter-Eater Lad is also a native of Bismoll and resides in the 31st century. She possesses the same abilities as he, as it is inborn in all members of their race. However, she could not join the Legion of Super-Heroes because of such similarities and instead became a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion-of-super-rejects/65-52849/\">Legion of Super-Rejects</a>. In the Marvel Universe, there are also those who possess the ability of matter ingestion, but at a much lower level than their DC counterparts. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freakshow/29-4994/\">Freakshow</a>, a young mutant from Genosha, has the power to transform into a variety of different creatures all with different powers. Some of these forms have allowed him to perform feats in eating abnormal substances such as building debris. He has also been able to swallow <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/unus-the-untouchable/29-33559/\">Unus The Untouchable</a> but could not digest him thanks to the impenetrable force field that surrounds his body. Finally, there is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maggott/29-15072/\">Maggott</a>, even though he does not actually possess a digestive system he still can \"eat\" almost anything. Within him live two creatures called Eany and Meany that he releases from his body so that they can find any material to devour.

The triplets known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kleinstock-brothers/29-15102/\">Kleinstock Brothers</a> were servants of Magneto and though not to much has been completely established about them it is known that the two brothers, Harlan and Sven could merge into a single being, as they are now permanently a single being that simply possesses two upper bodies. However, if their brother Eric could merge with them as well was never said as he did on their first mission but it is assumed he could. Then their is one of those peculiarities i n the comic book world, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bwanna-beast/29-52618/\">B' Wanna Beast</a>, the man who had the ability to create strange creatures with his ability to merge two different animals together, creating a chimera. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/collective-man/29-9751/\">Collective Man</a> is made up of five brothers, and when they combine to create the Collective Man, they have many times more power (strength, speed, etc.) than they had as separate beings. When they were first introduced, they only had five times the amount of strength that they normally had (because five of them would merge into one), but soon they learned how to gain more power by picturing the population of China in their head, allowing them to use the population's physical and mental prowess. The St. Croix siblings also have the ability to merge into a being or other beings. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-twins/29-41270/\">M Twins</a>, the youngest of the siblings merged and for a while impersonated their older sister, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m/29-40460/\">M</a>, while she had been taken captive by their even older brother, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emplate/29-10579/\">Emplate</a>. While in this state, they gained all of their sisters powers, but it is unknown what powers and abilities they would have, but we have seen the other siblings merge. The Twins and Emplate at one point merged to become the powerful being known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-plate/29-43524/\">M-Plate</a>.</p><h3>Pheromone Manipulation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"723495\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/723495-swoman002_cov_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Woman, Pheromone Manipulator\"><img id=\"723495\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/723495-swoman002_cov_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Woman, Pheromone Manipulator\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Woman, Pheromone Manipulator</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to generate and control pheromones which may have various effects such as affecting emotional and physical states such as inducing sleep, fear, happiness, pleasure and many more. A New Mutant, Wallflower, had this ability, but she did not know how to control it properly, and when she would feel a strong emotion, it could affect her pheromone powers, and cause her to make the people around her feel the same way, but luckily, when she moved to the Xavier Institute, she was roomed with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/renascence/29-40537/\">Renascence</a>, whose mutant power at the time was aerokinesis, so she was able to use this to keep Wallflower's pheromones at bay. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sean-garrison/29-45226/\">Sean Garrison</a>, Wallflower's father, also had this ability, but he learned to control it, and used his powers to get what he wanted in life. The alternate versions of these two in the House of M had great control over their powers, and they deployed their powers in various ways: strike fear into people so they couldn't use their powers, use it to make people suicidal and even turn a whole room of people against each other (the two were evil in this alternate reality(well, not completely, but they worked for the government(see their pages for more details))).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a> (Jessica Drew) doesn't deploy her power intentionally, but sometimes during a fight they are released, and they attract males but repulse females. This power was the one that let the New Avengers beat <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecker/29-2252/\">Wrecker</a>, and during this battle, the male members of the New Avengers at the time admitted that they had been attracted to her recently. Spider-Woman uses a special perfume to stop her powers. Beast also has this power, but obviously because he is a male, unlike Spider-Woman he attracts females. Before being depowered, the mutant prostitute <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ripcord/29-11517/\">Ripcord</a> possessed this ability, normally using it to pleasure her clients, but when she joined the X-Men, began using it offensively, using it to make her enemies throw up among other things. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purple-man/29-3227/\">Purple Man</a> releases special pheromones from his skin, and when inhaled by people, he is able to control their minds. He tends to use his powers for evil, an example of this is where he psychologically tortured <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jessica-jones/29-2265/\">Jessica Jones</a> but making her watch him rape women and humiliate herself by making her do various things (He didn't sexually abuse her though). The Purple Man had gotten one woman pregnant after mind controlling and sexually abusing her, and this produced <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/persuasion/29-28770/\">Persuasion</a>, his daughter who has the same power as her father put when she uses her powers on someone their skin turns purple too. Wolverine's mutant abilite's of sense and smell clearly come from those of real life Wolverines. Spider-Man has his powers based of those of an arachind spider, which contain wall crawling, spidersense, slinging webbing. Daken can also use the power of pheremones to manipulate others to do his will.</p><h3><b>Photographic Reflexes</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"411066\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411066-Taskmaster_super.JPG\" title=\"Taskmaster\"><img id=\"411066\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411066-Taskmaster_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Taskmaster\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Taskmaster</div></div></div></div><p>Photographic reflexes is the ability to copy a physical movement exactly how the possessor of this power saw it.

When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/echo/29-9038/\">Echo</a> was first introduced, she watch several different videos of superheroes performing various moves and copied them. She was also seen playing the piano very well, apparently a skill she learned because of her power. Echo's power even extends to the point where she can learn to speak a new language by watching someone speak it (because she is deaf, Echo has to lip read). <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/monica-dawson/29-52757/\">Monica Dawson</a> has an iPod filled with multiple moves that might come in handy for her to copy, including parkour.

Regenerating each time he is killed makes Doomsday the ultimate enemy and with his strength able to match the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Man of Steel</a>'s there is limit of his power.</p><h3>Reconstruction/Reconstitution/Reforming</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"195136\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/195136-9422-rockslide_super.jpg\" title=\"Rockslide (in lava/magma Limbo form): A Psionic Golem\"><img id=\"195136\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/195136-9422-rockslide_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Rockslide (in lava/magma Limbo form): A Psionic Golem\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rockslide (in lava/magma Limbo form): A Psionic Golem</div></div></div></div><p>The ability to reconstruct/reconstitute/reform one's body after it has been destroyed. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide</a> has the ability to do this, and is probably one of the only known comic book characters that has this power. When he first reconstructed, he needed the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a>'s telekinesis to reform him. The second time he reformed, he did it by himself, but this time his form was a lot rockier, but he lost his ability to fire his limbs the second time around. He was later able to reform again, but this time out of rocks from Limbo, that included magma, and also allowed him to be resistant to magic. He later learned to reform himself consciously, and now he can do it at any time. When Rockslide explodes and then reforms, he is unable to carry his clothes with him. Superhumans who can self detonate (below) are able to reform after they detonate. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a> is able to reform himself from the gas he turns himself into after he explodes. Unlike Rockslide, he possesses a special field that allows him to reform the clothes he's wearing too. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/breakdown/29-30179/\">Breakdown</a> is also able to reform after she explodes. These superhumans don't have to reform straight away, and can stay in these states for quite a time.</p><h3><b>Self Detonation</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"411825\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411825-untitled_super.JPG\" title=\"Nitro: The Stamford Explosion\"><img id=\"411825\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411825-untitled_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Nitro: The Stamford Explosion\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nitro: The Stamford Explosion</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to explode one's body mass creating an explosion and reform (see above). When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide</a> explodes, he only explodes his body, as in he doesn't blow up with energy like Nitro. Rockslide's explosions don't extend that far, and tend to just throw the rock fragments of his body, doing very little harm to the surrounding environment. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a> on the other hand can cause devastating blasts, like real explosions. Sometimes the can be relatively small ones, enough to destroy a building, but other times, when Nitro is on M.G.H. (Mutant Growth Hormone), he can cause incredibly gigantic blasts, proven recently when he exploded destroying Stamford. If he explodes to many times in a row, Nitro will pass out from the amount of energy he used to explode.</p><h3>Sonic Scream</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"730621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/730621-89159_51393_black_bolt_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The Super-Loud Black Bolt\"><img id=\"730621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/730621-89159_51393_black_bolt_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Super-Loud Black Bolt\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Super-Loud Black Bolt</div></div></div></div><p>Sonic screaming is the ability to use one's voice to create powerful screams. These screams can cause various effects, depending on how powerful the scream is. Some screams are powerful enough to shatter objects and cause unconsciousness. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\">Banshee</a> (Sean)was even able to use his sonic scream to allow him to fly among various other things such as hear distant conversations and more. His daughter <a href=\"/banshee/29-3181/\">Banshee</a> (Theresa) has been seen using her powers in ways her father never has, such as creating force fields, sending secret message via her voice that only the target can hear, and like the Sirens, Siryn can use her voice as a form of persuasion, but this does not work on mutants. When in combat, Siryn normally focuses her voice into what she calls a \"sonic lance\", a tight focused beam of sound waves, that can severely injure/damage anything it comes into contact with. These two characters have very powerful cries, and once it has even been stated that Siryn could probably destroy and entire city block with her voice. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Blackbolt</a>, King of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> has the ability of sonic scream, but his are much more powerful. A mere whisper from him has proved to have devastating results, taking out a whole fleet of helicopters and keeping the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> at bay. As King of the Inhumans, obviously he has to address his people, so he and his wife, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>, have learned sign language and she speaks for him. Blackbolt has trained himself so he'll never make a sound accidentally. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/motormouth/29-7973/\">Motormouth</a> has this ability too, but she is probably best known for humming very quietly, this allowing her to use ultrasound to see through objects. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-canary/29-1689/\">Black Canary</a>'s \"Canary Cry\" is basically this power. The cry is so strong that it is able to dent steel, and even kill someone within its range.</p><h3><b>Superhuman Agility</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2402893\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/78647/2402893-nightcrawler.jpg\" title=\"Nightcrawler\"><img id=\"2402893\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/78647/2402893-nightcrawler_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Nightcrawler\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nightcrawler</div></div></div></div><p>The user's personal agility, balance and bodily co-ordination are enhanced to the levels beyond a normal humans limit even surpassing a trained athlete and allowing the user to jump over heights twice their height or even walk a tight rope with ease. One of the characters most probably best known for his superhuman agility is probably <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a>, picture here: Beast has always been seen performing complex stunts such as back flips and has been seen jumping far through the air. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> also has superhuman agility, and can easily perform complex stunts. He once even teleported onto the head of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>'s Phoenix memorial statue, and stood on its head, on his toes. Another character whos main power is superhuman agility is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider man.</a> Spiderman has fantastic agility. His agility is so great he can evade gunfire and dodge thrown items, such as shrunkein. He can do stunts like olympic gymnasts. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>'s agility is far beyond that of even an olympic level athlete, as is her balance and coordination.</p><h3><b>Superhuman Dexterity</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"88413\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1093/88413-187439-beast_super.jpg\" title=\"Beast: A Natural Acrobat\"><img id=\"88413\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1093/88413-187439-beast_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Beast: A Natural Acrobat\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Beast: A Natural Acrobat</div></div></div></div><p>The ability allows one to be completely skilled with the hands and the body. For example, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> can perform the exact same tasks with either his hands or his feet.</p><h3><b>Superhuman Durability</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"186453\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/186453-32044-luke-cage_super.jpg\" title=\"Luke Cage: Nothing Can Pierce His Skin...

Or Can It?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Luke Cage: Nothing Can Pierce His Skin... Or Can It?</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to have a higher resistance to one or more forms of damage before being injured. People such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/solomon-grundy/29-8342/\">Solomon Grundy</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tick/29-40485/\">Tick</a> has this superpower. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a> is only superhumanly durable and is not completely invulnerable, as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adamantium/18-40759/\">adamantium</a> can dent his skin. The same apply to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frenzy/29-2163/\">Frenzy</a>, who has skin as hard as steel. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>'s diamond form is also only superhumanly durable, as it has been destroyed (shattered to be exact by a diamond bullet) and has been pierced by diamond, and it is most probable that it could be pierced by adamanitum too. Various superhumans with superhuman strength have superhuman durability, as normally the thickness of their skin increases and the extra muscle mass help protect them. When The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League</a> had to battle <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/solomon-grundy/29-8342/\">Solomon Grundy</a> after he returned from the dead, the League couldn't hurt him. The only thing that was able to stop him and hurt him was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">Hawkgirl</a>'s mace made of Nth metal that is able to hurt magical or disrupt magical people or things. Invulnerability and superhuman durability are two different things, as invulnerability means that nothing can penetrate your skin at all, where as superhuman durability only makes you more resistant to these outside threats. Not invulnerable <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> has a high level of resistance to threats which might cause a normal human a great deal of harm. Radiation has little effect on her although she is still affected by heat. She has a more durable body than most but she can still be damaged by regular items like bullets or arrows, it would be noted that piercing weapons such as bullets, may penetrate her skin, but not her muscle tissue. This ability holds true for both <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a>.</p><h3>Superhuman Speed</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"287403\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11275/287403-155924-bart-allen.jpg\" title=\"The Flash\"><img id=\"287403\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11275/287403-155924-bart-allen_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Flash\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Flash</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to move at a rate of acceleration and maximum speed in excess to that of normal optimal human capacity. Some who possess super-speed interact with an inter dimensional field of energy commonly referred to as the Speed Force. If an individual moves their body at speeds in excess to the speed of light, they physically interface with the Speed Force, like the super hero the <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a> who is known to be the fastest man alive. oftentimes exiting their home reality and traveling throughout the time stream. Some individuals who possess this ability may be limited by certain atmospheric or geological conditions. <a href=\"/kryptonians/65-45710/\">Kryptonians</a> for example, can obtain a version of super-speed so long as they are within the sphere of influence of a Yellow sun star system. Their ability to use this power is in direct proportion to the levels of ultraviolet radiation that their body cells absorb. Others may have an divine gift like <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> and the <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/65-42494/\">Amazons</a>, <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> herself is able to reach great speeds from the gift granted by <a href=\"/hermes/29-15794/\">Hermes</a> the god of messengers, upon her birth. She has been seen able to reach speeds fast enough to reach the Speed Force. The majority of superheroes gain superhuman speed from this method, as it refers to manifesting abilities based on either an event that caused it, your genetic code or even some other way that your body evolved into being bestowed superpowers. The most commonly thought of mutants are the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, mutants like <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-53580/\">Quicksilver</a>.</p><h3>Superhuman Reflexes</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"78068\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/78068-34125-blade_super.jpg\" title=\"Blade's Quick Reaction\"><img id=\"78068\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/78068-34125-blade_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Blade's Quick Reaction\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Blade's Quick Reaction</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to react faster than a normal human. Blade has this ability due to the fact that he is part vampire and with him being a good fighter and knowing all of the arts enhances this ability. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blade/29-7570/\">Blade</a> reflexes are so good that ts even to the point where it comes naturally that he re-acts before his brain can actually analyze a situation. Even though this characteristic is found in humans, it also is selectively seen in rigorously trained martial artists. This shows that Blade has to have at least 25 to 50 years of martial arts training history. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> possesses reflex abilities similar to speedsters, such as The <a href=\"/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Flash</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/midnighter/29-2196/\">Midnighter</a> has fast reflexes due to his body being altered to give him inhuman balance as well as faster nerve endings so he can move and react quicker than any human and many superhumans. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madman/29-6704/\">Madman</a> also has fast reflexes. It is not unusual for certain characters with superhuman speed to have enhanced reflexes too. People such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a> and Aurora who have superhuman speed also have superhuman reflexes. Northstar has reflexes fast enough to dodge an on-coming object traveling at 18.7 mach. Aurora has been seen to have reflexes quick enough to check and apartment within seconds. With superhuman reflexes and the added bonus of his \"Spider-Sense\" power, Spider-Man can dodge various attacks quickly. People with photographic reflexes sometimes can perform some moves before they are even consciously aware that they're doing it, their body naturally re-acting to what is happening in the environment around them (an example of this is when Monica Dawson \"619\"'d a robber without knowing what she was doing).</p><h3><b>Superhuman Senses</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"385658\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18265/385658-110706-wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine\"><img id=\"385658\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18265/385658-110706-wolverine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to see, smell, taste, feel and/or hear more than a normal human. One of the most known character to possess this power is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. Wolverine always had a heightened sense of smell since being a spy and his nose is what usually gets him out trouble in all the situations he has been in. His power of smell helps him also to known about situations that happened and who was apart of those situations. Also with Wolverine's animalistic instinct he not only has a keen sense on smell but is also able to see in complete darkness and is also able to hear what humans can't. This can be either from a far distance or something that can't be heard close by. Another person who has this ability is Wolverine's arch-nemesis <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>. Sabretooth has the same animalistic powers just as Wolverine but in battle is always able to beat him. In the DC universe, a person that posses this power is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Timber Wolf</a> who gained his ability because of his father experimenting on him. This gave him the physical appearance of a wolf and wolf like instincts. He's able to track and find what he is looking for through his superhuman senses.</p><h3><b>Superhuman Stamina</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"780167\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/780167-wonderful_x3_dg.jpg\" title=\"The Wonder Girls\"><img id=\"780167\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/780167-wonderful_x3_dg_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Wonder Girls\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Wonder Girls</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to allow an individual's physical heartiness and their ability to function without tiring or undue strain. Characters who possess this power can often go for long periods of time without rest or even sleep. This power often works in combination with Superhuman Strength andInvulnerability. An individual may develop enhanced stamina either through alien heritage, genetic manipulation or biological augmentation. Other characters may develop enhanced stamina through mystical means, or through divine intervention. Characters with Super-Speed may possess increased stamina to a limited degree, but are often restricted by other factors relating to their speed-based abilities (such as increased metabolism.</p><p><a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a> can last a great deal of time in any fight and with virtually anyone. They have held their own in combat with foes as powerful as Gods. They do not tire out, as their bodies produces no lactic acids in their muscles, giving them the ability to fight until they drop dead.</p><p>The <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> is one that is known for is stamina, his body counteracts fatigue poisons that build up in his muscles during physical activity. In an enraged state, the Hulk is capable of exerting himself at peak physical capacity for several days before fatigue begins to affect him. However, much like his physical strength, the Hulk's stamina does increase as he becomes angrier.</p><h3>Superhuman Strength</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76837\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76837-75916-molly-hayes_super.jpg\" title=\"Molly Hayes: A Little Powerhouse\"><img id=\"76837\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76837-75916-molly-hayes_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Hayes: A Little Powerhouse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Molly Hayes: A Little Powerhouse</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to have a level of physical strength higher than that possible by a human being in real life, able to lift more than a normal humans body can handle. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>'s strength is directly connected to his emotional state, and the angrier he gets the stronger he gets. His cousin, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> who received a blood transplant from him, is also incredibly strong, but her strength doesn't vary depending on her emotional state. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> possesses an incredibly high level strength because of his godly status as the son of <a href=\"/gaea/29-15778/\">Odin</a>, All-father of Asgard, and <a href=\"/gaea/29-15778/\">Gaea</a>, Elder Goddess of Earth, which makes him the strongest of the Asgardians. Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a>, who is the strongest Olympian and the Olympian god of strength, was conceived by <a href=\"/zeus/29-10226/\">Zeus</a>, All-father of Olympus, and a mortal woman to be the physically stronger than the gods. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> has this ability, but because his Atlantean heritage, he is stronger when he is covered in water. He is still very strong out of water, but the more he dries of the more, the weaker he becomes (strength wise only). The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> also has incredibly high levels of superhuman strength, the first being much stronger though. But, if needed to boost their strength, these two can use their energy adsorption power to adsorb energy, using this to increase their strength.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> also possessed super strength when she had absorbed Ms. Marvel's powers and later <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a>'s, but has now lost both these characters abilities. Another well known character with superhuman strength is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>, who is as strong as the others that have been stated. Although when first introduced <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molly-hayes/29-1936/\">Molly Hayes</a> could only lift a few tones, she can now lift at least one hundred tones when she toppled a gigantic monster. A side effect of this power for Molly is that she falls asleep after using her power. Her eyes also glow pink when she uses her powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> is also very strong when in his armored form, but he has been seen to be overpowered by the Hulk. Gentle has a variation of superhuman strength dubbed \"extreme strength\". <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gentle/29-41124/\">Gentle</a> can increase the level of his physical level to a level that shouldn't even be possible. Because this increase in mass puts so much strain on his body, he has to keep it in check with vibranium tattoos. Later in his life, the tattoos will fail to keep his power under control, and he'll die. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a> is another superhuman with strength that passes incredibly high levels, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>, being who he is, has a very high level of superhuman strength. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/strong-guy/29-7599/\">Strong Guy</a>, using his power mutant power, can increase his strength, but it is already at a high level.</p><p>In the DC universe, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> has many powers including superhuman strength to an incredibly vast degree due to his Kryptonian physiology's ability to absorb, store and process yellow solar radiation. Superman's strength is dependent upon him being in reasonable proximity of a yellow sun. Superman retains his strength if he has absorbed and stored enough yellow solar radiation to maintain his strength when not in proximity of a yellow sun, though it will ebb as he expends energy. His cousins, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-girl/29-4915/\">Power Girl</a> also has this ability when under the influence of the yellow sun as well. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> possesses super strength granted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demeter/29-10914/\">Demeter</a> (Goddess of the Earth) upon her birth. She is considered to be the strongest superhero in the DC Universe after Superman and possibly Captain Marvel (Billy Batson), making her the strongest superheroine in the DC universe. <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> has super strength like that of her sister <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> blessed upon her by the <a href=\"/titans-of-myth/65-54301/\">Titans of Myth</a>. <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a> also has strength and she was trained by the <a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/65-42494/\">Amazons</a>. She also is a Demi-God just like her half brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a>, their father being <a href=\"/zeus/29-5306/\">Zeus</a>.</p><h3><b>Superhuman Vision</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"420689\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/420689-ASTONISHING_X-MEN_5image_big_large_super.jpg\" title=\"Supergirl\"><img id=\"420689\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/420689-ASTONISHING_X-MEN_5image_big_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Supergirl\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Supergirl</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to see more than a normal human of a 20/20 vision.

It was believed at first when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a> joined <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> that she possessed omniscience, as she constantly claimed \"I'm Layla Miller. I know stuff\", but later on it is hinted that she has great precognitive powers, as she says \"I don't know everything. If I did, then I would say \"I'm Layla Miller. I know everything\"\" (paraphrased slightly). It has been hinted in Doctor Who that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-who/29-33354/\">the Doctor</a> himself can \"see time and space\", although it is not completely known if this is just pre- and recognition or if it is possible omniscience.</p><h3>Paralysis</h3><p>The ability to cause paralysis in others.

The Doctor has immense levels of intelligence, as is constantly seen when he is \"scientifically babbling\". He is very intuitive and is very good at thinking on the spot. The Doctor's intelligence is his main weapon, and it is probably the main thing that has kept him alive over the years (well, that and regeneration). But there is one thing that limits his knowledge use as seen recently: that he hasn't got that human edge that comes in handy in crisis's. As seen with Doctor-Donna, she claimed she was able to come up with things that he \"couldn't dream of in a million years. Amadeus Cho, the seventh smartest person in the world, constantly sees things in formulas, and has been shown performing various stunts to protect himself with this, for example, taking down a helicopter that was chasing him by quickly figuring out the angle th mirror of his moped needed to be to reflect it. Another person who is consider very intelligent is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lex-luthor/29-41952/\">Lex Luthor</a>. In one of the Justice League Episode's when in Lex's mad attempt to reawaken Brainiac, he end up bringing back Darkseid instead. Lex is taking to a place where the Anti-Life Equation exists and the man said that only a person with a high level intelligence could make it that far. What a first seemed as if Lex mind was lost forever, he would later come back to Earth with the one thing Darkseid always wanted the most. The Anti-Life Equation. Obtaining this object would suggest that Lex has a high level of super intelligence.</p><h3>Extra Sensory Perception</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"465050\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/465050-freespidey2sense2_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man: His Spider-Senses Are Tingling\"><img id=\"465050\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/465050-freespidey2sense2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man: His Spider-Senses Are Tingling\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man: His Spider-Senses Are Tingling</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to acquire information by paranormal means independent of any known physical senses or deduction from previous experience.</p><p>This is also known as the sixth sense.

He can also see his body while he is in the Spirit World but he doesn't have any powers of what goes on in this state. He is helpless and he could die if someone was to kill him while in this mode. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-girl/29-3566/\">Marvel Girl</a> has this power.

Another example is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a>, who once even went to a comic book store to find comics about herself to find out how to defeat a villain.</p><p>Other examples are just of characters being able to peer into other worlds such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak/29-1474/\">Cloak</a> who is constantly aware of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkforce/12-41411/\">Darkforce Dimension,</a> and very powerful characters such as Silver Surfer, Mr. Mxyzptlk and the Beyonder.

It is not known if this is how all empaths powers work. Empath did misuse his power, on more than one occasion, but the most known misuse of his power was when he used it to manipulate the emotions of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>, and to this day, she is paranoid when in his presence, fearing he is still manipulating her. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cordelia-frost/29-10571/\">Cordelia Frost</a>, sister of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, is a very powerful empath, and although she hasn't appeared in many comics, she has been shown to perform amazing feats with this ability, including using it to communicate with others. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lockheed/29-4444/\">Lockheed</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a>'s falcon possess some degree of empathy, allowing them some form of communication with humans. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peter-petrelli/29-47678/\">Peter Petrelli</a>'s mimicry power has been dubbed \"empathic mimicry\", suggesting that he uses empathy to copy powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luna/29-10962/\">Luna Maximoff'</a>s power of empathy works in a different way, and she is able to view someone's emotions in various different colors. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/meggan/29-7604/\">Meggan</a>'s power of empathy effect her other powers, in ways such as: her emotional state can cause her elemental powers to effect the environment around her, and if she is feeling a strong emotion towards someone she can morph into them. <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a> was granted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/athena/29-10912/\">Athena</a>.

However, Blindfold isn\u2019t the best at informing others of her visions and is often very cryptic. Another cryptic precog is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a>, but she is very different, and views the universe differently because of it usually. Layla doesn\u2019t always disclose the information she receives, as she claims that she will be struck down if she does.

Unlike precognition, premonitions are normally about one certain thing, and are normally very short, and sometimes, the possessor might have to touch something to receive a premonition. Premonition isn't a power that seems to be constantly on, and a possessor isn't always able to receive one when they want one. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dream-girl/29-1254/\">Dream Girl</a> has this power and in her dreams she has the power to see whats going to happen in the future.

The first host of these visions that we witnessed was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doyle/29-21625/\">Allen Francis Doyle</a>, a half demon, but they were passed on to Cordelia Chase, and because she was human, she experienced tremendous pain.

One of truest technopaths was a young girl named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/network/29-40657/\">Network</a> who capable of communicating with and manipulating all forms of electronics. Some technopaths such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-box/29-15111/\">Black Box</a> can retain all the information they glean using their superpowers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/serafina/29-43771/\">Serafina</a>, a member of the Children of the Vault, has the ability to connect with and utilize any technology she needs for her purposes. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sage/29-4559/\">Sage</a>, whose mind is like that of a computer, has artificial technopathy as she wears special glasses that can allow her to interact with computers and other technology. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> has limited technopathy as he can communicate with his armor, sending it commands through brain signals, he has become one with it. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/omega-sentinel/29-3421/\">Omega Sentinel</a> is part human and part machine, making her what some might consider, to be the perfect technopath as she is a part of both groups (technological entity and mutant). In the DC Universe, there exists one of the most powerful technopaths, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyborg-superman/29-12926/\">Cyborg Superman</a>, who uses technology as hosts to his essence, now that he no longer has a body. A highly-advanced technopath is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-drummer/29-17584/\">The Drummer</a> who sees everything in the form of patterns, allowing him to decode beings, technology and even magic. Angela Spica the second <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/engineer/29-17607/\">Engineer</a> is a technopath who is capable of doing almost anything she imagines mainly connecting herself to machines.

Telepathy is probably one of the most well-known powers in the comic book industry, frequently used throughout it. Telepaths power can range anywhere from possessing mass populations to just using it to communicate. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> is a well known and powerful telepath, but rarely (or he didn't use to) use his power to force people to do anything, as he believed in the right of free will. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>, who was a very powerful psionic mutant, first developed this power before her telekinesis, when her best friend was hit by a car and Jean connected with her mind, a process that nearly killed her. So, because she was unable to cope with both powers at such a young age (telekinesis and telepathy), Professor X placed mental blocks in her mind so she couldn't access her telepathy (which she didn't know she had), and later on, he activated it, and Jean Grey is one of the most powerful telepaths in the Marvel Universe, and it is believed that one day she will surpass even Professor X himself. Jean has been shown to use her power in more forceful ways, such as when she tore through the mental defenses of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> after she caught her having an affair with her wife, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>. Emma Frost, while also being a well experienced and powerful telepath (but not as powerful as the two above), Emma used to use her powers all the time to get what she wanted, but now as a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> and a teacher, she uses them more skillfully, being shown to be able to defeat the more powerful <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-girl/29-3566/\">Rachel Grey</a> with her skill. Rachel Grey, daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey from an alternate reality, possesses raw telepathic power, but lacks the skill in using it. Other offsprings of Cyclops and Jean Grey (or a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">clone</a> of Jean), whether they be from an alternate reality or not, have been seen to possess immense psionic powers ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a>). <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stepford-cuckoos/65-4443/\">The Stepford Cuckoos</a>, who are able to form a hive mind between them, are also immensely powerful telepaths, especially when together.

As a result of his mutant power manifesting and blowing half his face and his chest off, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/decibel/29-2244/\">Chamber</a> had the ability to communicate via telepathy, although he could not do anything else with this power. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-parkman/29-47673/\">Matt Parkman</a>'s ability started off as the ability to \"read minds\", but it has progressed to the point where he can implant and send thoughts.</p><h3><b>Illusion Casting</b></h3><p>The ability to alter the perceptions of others.</p><h3>Astral trapping</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"720059\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/720059-209974_46321_shadow_king_large_super.jpg\" title=\"Shadow King\"><img id=\"720059\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33828/720059-209974_46321_shadow_king_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow King\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shadow King</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to cause an astral projection to stay on the astral plane, usually in one specific place.</p><h3><b>Memory manipulation</b></h3><p>Ability to erase or enhance the memories of another.</p><h3><b>Mind control</b></h3><p>Ability to control the actions or reasoning of another with the mind.</p><h3><b>Psionic Blasts</b></h3><p>Ability to overload another's mind causing pain, memory loss, loss of consciousness, vegetative state or death after having created a psionic link into that person's mind.</p><h3><b>Possession</b></h3><p>Ability to take control of another person\u2019s body via astral projection or mind transfer.</p><h3><b>Psychic weapons</b></h3><p>Ability to create a weapon of psychic energy that can harm mentally and not physically.</p><h3><b>Telekinesis</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"411556\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411556-MarvelGirl3-1_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Man: A Powerful Telekinetic\"><img id=\"411556\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/411556-MarvelGirl3-1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Man: A Powerful Telekinetic\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Man: A Powerful Telekinetic</div></div></div></div><p>This is the power to both control and manipulate materials with the mind, this usually means in the form of moving however it can be such things as creating force fields or transforming atoms themselves. In general, telekinetics are the most powerful beings in existence as they have the power to manipulate matter and/or energy, the fundamental forces of the universe. One of the most powerful telekinetics in the Marvel Universe is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>/ <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Dark Phoenix</a> who has had her powers enhanced to cosmic levels by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>'s hosts are often gifted telekinetics, including the drug-addicted youth, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-omega/29-40583/\">Kid Omega</a>. Another way for one to become a powerful telekinetic is through cloning or inheriting the trait. Such is the case of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> (the clone of Jean Grey) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a> (the son of Jean Grey) who also happen to both be creations of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>, a fellow telekinetic. A telekinetic who has potential to be one of the greatest is the young mutant, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a> who often uses his powers to create force fields. Telekinetics are also commonly telepaths, as they have mastery over the mind and are provided with various abilities, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a>. There are also telekinetics who are limited to only manipulating certain things, like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, who can only manipulate the electromagnetic spectrum. In the DC Universe, notable telekinetics include <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psimon/29-5951/\">Psimon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/raven/29-3584/\">Raven</a> who are both skilled psychics. Then there is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terra/29-5307/\">Terra</a> whose telekinesis is limited to effecting earth, though in itself is still a formidable force. One who is very adept at using his telekinesis, so precisely that he can slice off the top of one's skull without damaging their brain is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sylar/29-47679/\">Sylar</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sylar/29-47679/\">Sylar</a> now uses his telekinesis to obtain more superpowers but it has remained his trademark ability. His nemesis, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peter-petrelli/29-47678/\">Peter Petrelli</a>, is now also an experienced telekinetic thanks to his ability to use empathic power mimicry...and so this ability usually emerges in times of hatred and rage. In the Star Wars universe, telekinesis is what sets the most powerful beings apart from the ordinary civilians. By using the Force (either Light or Dark sides of it) <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-sith/65-44460/\">The Sith</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jedi-order/65-41234/\">Jedi Order</a> can move objects with their mind, the size of the objects they can move differs quite extensively. A specialized telekinetic whose powers are still vast is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aspen/29-41245/\">Aspen</a> who has complete control over water, enough that which she can seemingly control it without a thought.</p><h2>Manipulating Fundamental Forces or Reality</h2><h3>Air/Wind manipulation (Aerokinesis)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"105106\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/105106-127453-crystal_super.jpg\" title=\"Crystal: Summoning the Elements\"><img id=\"105106\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/105106-127453-crystal_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal: Summoning the Elements\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Crystal: Summoning the Elements</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to control, generate, or absorb air or wind.

This gives the possessor various powers that can range from intangibility (see below) to super strength. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> of the Avengers is well known for possessing this ability, normally using it to make his hand intangible, phasing it into his opponent's chest and solidifying it causing them tremendous pain. He can lower his density so he can fly and become intangible, and higher his density so he could gain superhuman strength. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstone/29-3279/\">Moonstone</a> can use her gravity manipulation powers to alter her density.

When he would touch an organic, and it had to be organic, being or object, it would, well wither. A great example of the effects of Wither's power was shown in the pages of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-x-men-childhoods-end-part-1-of-4/37-106297/\">New X-Men #20</a>. Wither rushed out of his room, and believing he lost his mutant power, he grabbed Laurie Collins ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wallflower/29-40535/\">Wallflower</a>) arm, only to have it begin to wither. Jay Guthrie ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Icarus</a>) quickly pushed him away and luckily her arm was still there. But later, after Josh Foley ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a>) tries to heal it, Laurie states that there isn't anything left to heal. Another person with a death touch (of sorts) is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>. When Rogue touches a person, she instantly adsorbs their life force, slowly killing them. If she touches another superhuman, she is able to adsorb/replicate their ability, leaving them without this ability for a period of time. If she touches a superhuman for long enough, she can adsorb/replicate this power permanently, and possibly even kill the person. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob/29-49331/\">Bob Bishop</a> has the ability of transmutation, but he has only been seen using this ability through contact with an object, and has been seen using it to kill. He once used it as a torture weapon by turning several appendages of a man to gold, causing incredible pain, and then, used it to turn his whole body to gold, killing the man.</p><h3><b>Energy Blasts</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"219702\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/219702-176450-cyclops_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops: Using Full Power\"><img id=\"219702\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/219702-176450-cyclops_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops: Using Full Power\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops: Using Full Power</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to expel various forms of energy from the body. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> a leader of the X-Men has this power.

Cyclops brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a> also has this power. Havok has the power to absorb cosmic energy into his cells and transform it into hot plasma. Unlike his brother his energy blasts are used through his hands instead of his eyes. Havok also can control the amount of power he wants to use which could be used simply to knock a person down or to cause an object to explode. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-ray/29-2049/\">Ray</a> also has this power and he uses it by absorbing light. He can also store light so that he can use them in a number of ways and can create destructive blasts of energy radiation. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jubilee/29-4562/\">Jubilee</a> before being de-powered was able generate colorful explosive plasma energy blasts through her hands as any shape having different effects on the targets.

He energy blasts are known as \"Star Bolts\" and are very powerful. Her blasts can break through solid concrete walls and this power was gained by the experiments s he was forced to endure by the Psions. Since it was known that Tamaraneans could absorb energy the experiments was able to make her absorb energy to where she could use them through her hands and eyes. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> is considered to have this ability to a certain extent.

When using his ability, he tends to shout \"FLAME ON!\" which has become a famous slogan. When using his powers, the Torch's body tends to be engulfed in flames, and it's speculated that this is the power that also allows him to fly, by using the flames to pick him up. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">The Phoenix Force</a> , the cosmic being, is created of \"cosmic fire\" and gives it's hosts the abilty to manipulate this \"cosmic fire\". One of the personalities of the crazy powerful mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion/29-13349/\">Legion</a> possessed the ability of pyrokinesis. A multiple personality of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/typhoid-mary/29-1536/\">Typhoid Mary</a> also possessed this ability. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a> is able to use this power in synch with her terrakinesis so she can manipulate lava/magma and engulf herself in a \"magma form\". <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/match/29-40674/\">Match</a>, a student of the Xavier Institute, is constantly engulfed in flame and normally projects flame from his hands. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pyro/29-3554/\">Pyro</a>, before he died, could manipulate fire, but not generate it.

Many characters claims to possess this ability however that isn't quite true as many are either immune to aging but are able to die in other ways or other reasons.

It was thought that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> was immortal after many resurrection after deaths by characters such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molecule-man/29-11880/\">Molecule Man</a>, however he met his demise at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>'s hand (or should I say <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mjolnir/18-40971/\">hammer</a>). <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vampires/12-55796/\">Vampires</a> in most mediums are portrayed as being immortal, usually the type that are immune to aging, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-20094/\">Angel</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/buffyverse/12-55687/\">Buffyverse</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dracula/29-7206/\">Dracula</a> from the Marvel Universe or <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eric-northman/29-68505/\">Eric Northman</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sookie-stackhouse/29-68507/\">Sookie Stackhouse</a> universe.

The character most probably well known for this ability is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>. While at first it was only thought that she only had the power of invisibility it was later revealed that she could create force fields, and then it was revealed that this was all through the power of light manipulation. Invisible Woman has complete control over her power, and is probably the most powerful member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>. She can make just herself or others invisible. She can generate incredibly powerful force fields, enough to withstand one of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>'s punches, and she can reform these force fields create force blasts of sorts. She can generate force fields to knock people back, use it to lift and move objects and as a method of transport, create disks or a forcefield around her that allows her to move through the air. She can even use them to form weapons such as swords. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aurora/29-3189/\">Aurora</a>, when they were first introduced, could make contact and generate blinding flashes of light. Later, Northstar was able to do this himself, and create force blasts or blast light that can cause concussion. Recently, they have been seen to generate light when in contact with each other again, allowing them to blind <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frenzy/29-2163/\">Frenzy</a> temporarily. Although Dazzler can't directly manipulate light, she can convert sound into light, releasing it in various different ways. Energy manipulators such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vulcan/29-21233/\">Vulcan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> can also generate light, most commonly while blasting energy blasts.</p><h3>Magnetism Manipulation (Magnokinesis)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"108351\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/108351-148069-polaris_super.jpg\" title=\"Polaris : Mistress of Magnetism\"><img id=\"108351\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/108351-148069-polaris_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Polaris : Mistress of Magnetism\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Polaris : Mistress of Magnetism</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to control or generate magnetic fields. Magneto is probably the best known charcter to possess this ability in all of comics, dubbing himself \u201cThe Master of Magnitism\u201d. Magneto is an Omega Level Mutant and is very a very powerful magnokinetic. He is also very creative in the ways he uses his powers such as creating forcefields, raising and reconstructing Asteroid M and holding it in Earth\u2019s orbit and controlling radiation in the electromagnetic wavelength. Magneto\u2019s daughter, Polaris, also has the ability of magnitism manipulation, but is much less powerful than her father, but powerful none the less. She lost her magnetic abilities originally after M-Day, but Apocalypse\u2019s technology wired to her nervous system replicates her original ability and she is now more powerful than ever, and has been seen using her powers to restrain powerful combatants such as Vulcan, move and shield a spaceship, hold a ceiling up below an ocean and remove a chip from a Skrull\u2019s brain. In DC <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-polaris/29-10996/\">Doctor Polaris</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a> (as well as all from his home planet) are the most famous users of this power.</p><h2>Matter Manipulation</h2><h3><b>Mass Manipulation</b></h3><p>Ability to increase or decrease mass in an object or person.</p><h3><b>Molecular Manipulation</b></h3><p>Ability to mentally manipulate molecules and objects on a molecular level.

People with this power are able to push their atoms through the spaces of that of solid objects. Perhaps the character best known for having this power is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>. She can use her powers to a wide range of effects, such as walking on air (this is done automatically when she phases, otherwise she would fall through the floor(she can use this ability to ascend and descend too)). It is possible to use phasing as an offensive power, by phasing someone into a solid object, stop phasing, causing their atoms/molecules to fuse. Another known possesser of intangibility is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dl-hawkins/29-47666/\">D.L. Hawkins</a>. Some powerful telekinetics, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a> are able to use their telekinesis on a atomic/molecular level allowing them to use this ability to force they're atoms through that of a solids, allowing them to phase. People with density control can alter their density allowing them to become intangible. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loa/29-40672/\">Loa</a>, a student of the Xavier Institute is able to phase, but the object crumbles/disintegrates after she has passed through it.</p><h3>Plant Manipulation (Chlorokinesis)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"920233\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/920233-gcsirens_cv6_super.jpg\" title=\"Poison Ivy\"><img id=\"920233\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/920233-gcsirens_cv6_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Poison Ivy\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Poison Ivy</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to accelerate the growth of, control or animate plant life. Perhaps the most well-known prime new age character to possess this power is <a href=\"/klara-prast/29-54555/\">Klara Prast</a>. Klara is from 1907, and was rescued from her abusive husband by the Runaways after Karolina witnessed the use of her powers and followed her. Klara describes her ability as \u201ctalking to [the plants]\u201d, which is clear when she gives them verbal commands and they obey, althought this isn\u2019t always required. It is obvious that Klara\u2019s emotions are tied to her ability, because despite her great control over the ability, it is obvious that sometimes they overide her control. Another character with this power is Black Tom Cassidy, or at least he had it previously. Cassidy was a very powerful chlorokinetic, and gradually as his powers grew transformed into a mobile tree, and was able to reform if he was destroyed. Cassidy was also much more brutal with the use of his power, and once used it to break every bone in Squid-Boy\u2019s body. Cornelia Hale also has this ability, but it extends beyond living plants. She is also able to control wood and use it very effectively.</p><h3>Plasma Manipulation</h3><p>Characters who can produce external plasma.

This was the Scarlet Witch\u2019s natural mutant ability was this and she was able to cause chaos for many using it, and would dispel this in the form of hex bolts, and her powers were later augumented by her trained magical powers. She has caused everything from the spontaeneous melting of a gun barrel to the explosion of a gas station. Another character with this ability is a Black Cat, which turned out to be a latent mutant ability, that was activated through scientific experiments conducted on the character. Similar to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a> could make guns jam etc. But, Cat\u2019s power had a side affect, which involved accidently affecting the luck of anyone who\u2019s in her vicinity for too long, causing it to turn bad. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> then lifted her ability magically.</p><h3>Radiation Manipulation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"109775\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3329/109775-56090-radioactive-man_super.PNG\" title=\"Radiactive Man: BOOM!\"><img id=\"109775\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3329/109775-56090-radioactive-man_medium.PNG\" alt=\"Radiactive Man: BOOM!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Radiactive Man: BOOM!</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to generate, manipulate or have immunity to toxic radiation. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfire/29-2389/\">Starfire</a> has this ability and can absorb any kind of radiation without having any effect on her. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/radioactive-man/29-4807/\">Radioactive Man</a> is able to manipulate radiation on a wide scale, using it to various degrees and effects such as creating forcefields or dosing car engines with small levels of radiation, causing them to explode. Ted Sprague was a lot less adept in using his ability. Over the course of their relationship, Sprague was accidently (not knowing he had this power) releasing low levels of radiation, and although not strong enough to kill her instantly, it caused her to get radiation cancer, that eventually killed her. Other times, Ted, if angry or injured, would exploded causing high levels of damage. Once after being told not to \"burn hot\" but to \"Burn bright.\", Ted was even able to produce an E.M.P, causing a power failure at the Primatech Paper, Odessa, Texas facility.</p><h3>Reality Warping</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"88817\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88817-105823-m-day_super.jpg\" title=\"And With Three Little Words...\"><img id=\"88817\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88817-105823-m-day_medium.jpg\" alt=\"And With Three Little Words...\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">And With Three Little Words...</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to change or manipulate reality itself. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">The Scarlet Witch</a> is known for her ''hexes'' which can affect probability, but it was revealed that her powers are manifestation of chaos magic with which she can manipulate reality. She was able to return Wonder man from the dead, create the House of M, stripped the powers of over 90 % of the mutant population and so on. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/proteus/29-2165/\">Proteus</a>, another character from the Marvel Universe, was a powerful reality bender and usually distorted reality around him into insane version of the landscapes among other feats that were attributed to his insanity. Another powerful reality warper is Mad Jim Jaspers who's universe were supposed to be destroyed because it will consume the others universes. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a> although still young is the most powerful reality warper in the Marvel Universe, surpassing even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mad-jim-jaspers/29-31996/\">Mad Jim Jaspers</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-mxyzptlk/29-27436/\">Mr. Mxyzptlk</a> from DC is from another dimension and thus he can make everything he want.

They were both able to form incredibly powerful sonic blasts, and are even capable of using them to fly. Theresa's abilities have proven to be more flexible than her father's, as she has been seen using sound to alter brain chemicals in order to seduce someone or to limit a sound to a single person's hearing.

This power allows him to freeze the moisture in the air, allowing him to create ice slides for transport. This power can also be used offensively, as seen when Iceman froze every molecule in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion/29-13349/\">Legion</a>'s body.

He can reform himself from water and even use this to increase his mass levels. He can freeze or rise the temperature of his whole body or just certain appendages of it, allowing him to create ice weapons or turn to steam. He can also use his water form to squeeze through small spaces. <a href=\"/benders/12-52146/\">Waterbenders</a>, as suggested in the name, can bend water. They can also lower or rise the water's temperature, allowing them to make ice (for offensive attacks) or steam (as cover).

She can cause powerful rain storms, tornadoes, change temperatures, channel and generate lightning, snow, gusts of wind and more. Storm is immune to all of her powers. Storm has such control over her ability that she is able to manipulate the air around her close enough to allow her to fly. When Storm uses her powers, her eyes turn pure white. Storm has to keep her emotions under control as her emotions can affect her powers, which could potentially harm the environment in devastating ways. Storm has the potential to evolve into an \"Elemental\" as seen in the pages of <i>X-Men</i> during \"The Twelve\" Storyline. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> is another well known being who possesses this power, but he doesn't possess this ability himself, rather his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mjolnir/18-40971/\">Mjolnir</a> does. He is able to use it to manipulate the weather around him and even manipulate earth as recently seen. Thor usually channels lightning through the mystical hammer and uses is to attack him enemies. <a href=\"/weather-wizard/29-10462/\">Weather Wizard</a> is a lesser known character with this ability.

The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians of the Universe</a> also have this power since they are the ones who gave the Green Lantern's their power in the first place. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> has this ability. Not only can she generate a force field for herself but can create one around others. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/29-7477/\">Captain Britain</a> have this power. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/argent/29-3575/\">Argent</a> have this ability. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> has this power and creates an force field by using her mind. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/enchantress/29-7225/\">Enchantress</a> has this power also due to her being a sorceress. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sailor-venus/29-50516/\">Sailor Venus</a> has this power. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> has this ability because of his years experience of practicing his mutant powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro/29-10448/\">Sinestro</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Sinestro Corps</a> also have this power and is very similar to that of the Green Lantern Corps. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/violet-parr/29-52813/\">Violet</a> from The Incredibles has this power. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-sapphire/29-5698/\">Star Sapphire</a> has this power and her powers are also closely related to that of the Green Lantern Corps.

Firestorm can also create his own force field. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/circe/29-10924/\">Circe</a> also have this power since she is a Goddess. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> also has this ability and creates his force fields by getting power from his board. The Silver Surfer obtain his abilities when it was given to him by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>: The Devourer of Planets.

Though there are many who use energy sourcing as a way to gain superpowers, the source they use is what defines them. Heralds of Galactus such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fallen-one/29-40877/\">Fallen One</a> are nearly all-powerful however this is only because they are granted power by the Power Cosmic and dark matter, respectively. Another creation of Galactus, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tyrant/29-7123/\">Tyrant</a>, draws his power from the biospheres throughout the universe, growing weaker after every planet that his creator devours. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a> absorbs energy, only to expel it thus it has become his superpower to expel energy. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a> uses electrons as the source of his almighty power, as he can use them to create colossal effects. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">Sunspot</a>, much like a photosynthetic life form, gains his power from the Sun, as it will grant him both superhuman strength and the ability to emit heat himself. The Quantum Bands grant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a> powers nearing the level of a cosmic entity. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a> does not need an energy source to use his superpowers, however he can draw upon outside energy sources to strengthen himself. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> can increase her already formidable strength by drawing on outside sources, in her Binary form she can reach cosmic levels. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/erg/29-13366/\">Erg</a> also absorbs whatever energy is near him, granting him the capability of releasing it at will from his right eye in the form of concussive blasts. From the DC Universe some well-know characters are those whose source of power is stars, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starman/29-7646/\">Starman</a> draws his power from them, in the form of mass that he can place in whatever he chooses.

Her power is to make portals, that can allow her and the people who enter to come out another. Blink can make these portals extend over a short or vast distance. By channelling her portals into javelins, she can throw them at enemies, and when they hit, they expand to normal size, and teleport chunks of or the whole of what they've hit. Blink can even use her portals for normal hand-to-hand combat, where she punches through one portal and it comes out in a portal behind and enemy. Blink can even use her portals to re-direct attacks. Blink's name comes from the sound when she opens her portals. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie</a>'s spell, \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sihal-novarum-chinoth/12-55679/\">Sihal Novarum Chinoth</a>\", allows her to teleport herself and multiple others at the same time to another place. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> could create stepping discs that allowed teleportation, and could even create them so they'd come out in a different dimension. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abyss/29-15323/\">Abyss</a> previously had the ability to pull things into his body, where they would be transported to the dimension of fire and brimstone. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> teleports, he briefly and quickly enters the dimension and fire and brimstone and then reappears wherever he needs to be. This ability is the main ability of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spiral/29-9722/\">Spiral</a>, who can teleport herself and others fast distances and to other dimensions. Cloak can pull people and himself into his cloak which is a portal to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkforce/12-41411/\">Darkforce Dimension</a>, and then, like Nightcrawler, reappear at his target destination. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Dr. Strange</a> has this ability, as one of his magical talents.</p><h3><b>Electrical transportation</b></h3><p>Ability to travel through electrical conduits such as power lines or telephone lines.

The degrees of superhuman speed vary, whether it be from running about 60 mph like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> or if it's in the form of where you can run half way around the world in a few seconds. Such superhumans as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/speed/29-40518/\">Speed</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver,</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aurora/29-3189/\">Aurora</a> are able to move at extremely fast speeds, much faster than any vehicle etc, and they can even run on water or exceed the speed of sound, without getting injured. The first is even able to use his ability to shake objects and generate special vibrations that speed up their molecules, causing them to spontaneously combust. The latter has been seen to use her super speed to move fast enough to allow her fingers to pierce a humans body in the stomach and come out their back. Quicksilver can run fast enough so he's able to walk on water. While most of these people run at these high speeds, others such as Northstar can run or fly at these speeds. While they run at these fast speeds, it is believed that everything around them appears slower, very slow in fact, as they're moving so fast. While there are these people who can move at these very high speeds, there are some who don't, but still can move fast enough for it to be classed as superhuman speed, people such as Spider-Man or <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a>. Surge, a New X-Man is able to disperse her electricity in a way that allows her to run at superhuman speeds. When she runs at these speeds, her words merge together into one long one, and she tends to shout. If she uses to much electricity, she becomes sizzy and tired, and can sometimes pass out. In the DC Universe, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">The Flash</a> has this power gaining them the title \"The Fastest Man Alive\". <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Barry Allen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Bart Allen</a> all have this power and are all different people taking up The Flash mantle.

Another well known teleporter is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hiro-nakamura/47668/\">Hiro Nakamura</a> from the television series and web-comic Heroes.

This does not include the ability to travel through space to, thus teleporting through space, unless the person also has that power. The person therefore will only be able to travel from the exact spot the person left, and reappear somewhere through time, whether it be in the future or in the past. The only problem with this ability is the exact same problem with teleportation: they could end up merging with something else that is there, and thus die. Teleporters normally have other abilities that make sure that they don't end up occupying the same space as another person or object, but as there are not many people with the ability to travel through time themselves (strictly speaking about their powers, not if they use a machine etc), it is unknown if these characters have these other powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a> is a well known time traveller, but he is only able to time travel through machinary in his arm. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a> is well known for being able to create machines that allow time-travel, and he has built many over the years, most recently seen in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/49-20805/\">Cable</a>. One of the most well known time travellers though, who actually has this power is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hiro-nakamura/29-47668/\">Hiro Nakamura</a>.

Although Lady Mastermind hasn't been seen performing large scale illusions, it is thought that she has the potensial as her relatives, such as her sister, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martinique-jason/29-15167/\">Martinique</a> (known as Mastermind) and their father, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a> have been seen perfoming illusions on a vast scale. Martinique recently turned the whole of San Fransisco into a \"hippie land\" and her father was able to use his ability to make the whole world forget who the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> was. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Moonstar</a> had the ability to cast illusions, but only on the persons greatest fear. Another illusionist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/candice-willmer/29-54228/\">Candice Willmer</a> tends to use her power to alter her physical appearance (sort of like shape-shifting). Although Wilmer has been seen to use her powers to alter the environment around her also. <a href=\"/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie</a> like her sibling's and father( Lady Mastermind, Martinique and Mastermind) has the ability to create illusions but she unlike the rest of her family can't control these illusions. Pixie does this by producing a pink glitter like substance which cause's \"cheerful\" illusions.</p><h3>Shape Shifting</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"217451\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/217451-66326-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique: A Mistress of Disguise\"><img id=\"217451\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/217451-66326-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique: A Mistress of Disguise\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique: A Mistress of Disguise</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to change appearance or body structure at a molecular level. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> is probably one of the best known shapeshifters in the comic industry, using her power to it's full potential. At first, she could only shapeshift to appear as someone who is of the same height and weight as her. But, a few years ago, Mystique was exposed to very, very high levels of radiation, and now she can morph into anything, and normally when in battle grows claws and talons etc and uses them to fight with. She can even use her shapeshifting abilities to create her own clothes and weapons! <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morph/29-12547/\">Changeling,</a> a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> for a time also had this ability. He was killed after a while so his ability wasn't explored that much, but he did appear in the X-Men Animated Series under the name Morph, where he had very good control over his ability and was able to copy the physical structure of another being at the very least. In the DC universe the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a> has this ability. He usually shapes into a dragon and uses his powers by taking the shapes of his enemies, alien or human. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast-boy/29-3586/\">Beast Boy</a> also has this power.

He has the ability to transform into any animals and even extinct species. In the show Teen Titans he would turn into a T-Rex. When morphing he can stay as an animal without it having any effects on him and he also picks up the animals abilities when changed into the specific animal. If turns into a cheetah he will be able to run as fast as one. Also when morphed into different things he always stay his original color which is green. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a> a member of the New Mutants also have this power, but here power is more of a sub-catagory, with its own name called lycanthropy, meaning that she is able to turn into a wolf. Wolfsbane can turn into a full wolf, or a half-wolf half-human. When she is in these forms she tends to be a lot more feral and aggressive and gains the enhanced senses of a wolf.</p><h3>Elasticity</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"301544\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/301544-38143-mr-fantastic_super.jpg\" title=\"Mr. Fantastic\"><img id=\"301544\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/301544-38143-mr-fantastic_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mr. Fantastic\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mr. Fantastic</div></div></div></div><p>Ability to stretch, deform, expand and contract one's body into any form they can imagine.

Plastic Man gained his powers from being struck by a falling drum full of acid. The acid would go through his wounds which would give his elastic ability. Plastic Man taking up chemistry would create a formula using extracts from a plant called Gingold giving him the ability to stretch his body. In the Marvel universe, Mr. Fantastic has this abililty. He can stretch over three miles or fit himself through a pin hole, or even smaller. He could also expand just one part of his body or he could expand his organs so he is able to have a longer breath. Mr. Fantastic can also change his appearance and even imitate an inanimate object.</p><h3><b>Inorganic transformation</b></h3><p>Ability to transform completely into an inorganic substance while retaining organic properties</p><h3><b>Liquification</b></h3><p>Ability to turn partially or completely into a liquid.</p><h3>Size Shifting</h3><p>Ability to increase or decrease one's size.

Size shifting often ignores matters of mass over volume and the basic laws of thermo dynamics and energy exchange where a person or creature inflates to a new size an somehow gains mass without any visible means of accruing it. This manifests itself in a massive increase in strength while keeping the same basic body-shape and structure. Some creatures will warp into a new more visually powerful form as well.</p><h3>Sublimation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1212560\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5344/1212560-vapor_01_super.gif\" title=\"Vapor\"><img id=\"1212560\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5344/1212560-vapor_01_thumb.gif\" alt=\"Vapor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vapor</div></div></div></div><p>The abiltiy to turn into a gaseos state. This skill can be a magical power to be come ghost-like and invisible but due to the visual nature of comics it more often gifts the user with an insubstantial form that can pass through openings, or even solid by porous walls and barriers, many times smaller than their physical form. When in gaseous form the character my or may not keep their general physical appearance to aid with recognition or become fractured to the point of being unrecognizable as an amorphous cloud.</p><p>Often being in gas form has significant down sides making the user susceptible to weapons and situations that would not be an obstacle otherwise for example: being trapped inside glass without the mass to break the relatively thin glass nor have enough room to re-solidify.</p><p>As with size shifting this often ignores the laws of thermo dynamics where mass and weight are ignored, or not explained, as the character changes forms.</p><h3>Matter Mimicry</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1588533\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5586/1588533-abm12_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1588533\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5586/1588533-abm12_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Ability to transform into substance touched. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/absorbing-man/29-1779/\">Absorbing Man</a> is very well known for having this ability and has defeated countless heroes by turning himself into concrete, steel and sometimes by even copying their power via skin to skin contact.</p><p>For a time also, he would touch drugs, turn into them and sell himself on the streets.</p><p>Mimicing a known material has long been a popular trait for super heroes as firstly it can help name a new character, names of metals and substances giving an idea of the implied abilities of the hero, or a nickname (e.g. Man of Steel *bad example i know please replace with a better one*). It can also be visually represented where a character changes into a crystalline form, for example, as an artistic and dramatic visual.</p><h3>Were-Form</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1012309\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/1012309-wolfsbane20_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1012309\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/1012309-wolfsbane20_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>A partially animal form that allows enhanced physical abilities like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>. Anthropomorphic characters like werewolves have a large established folklore of strength, aggression and a list of vulnerabilities from which to draw from when imbuing a character with traits. Its often used as a form of curse on existing characters to give them a spin during an arc or one-shot. The effects can be either beneficial (enhanced powers: strength, agility, speed, scent) or negative (forced transformation, loss of rational thought and feral nature).</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Description</h2><p>\"Alchemy is the reconstruction of matter in new forms based on the knowledge of natural laws. This world flows by obeying these laws. Death, too, is part of that flow. Accept the flow of the world.\"</p><p>Traditionally alchemy is the quest to change 'worthless' base metals into gold via magic or means of chemistry.</p><p>Alchemy is the ability to change an items form and shape at will with a sort of \"medium\" called a transmutation circle. Transmutation circles are generally complex circle shaped markings, and the type of transmutation circle depends on the type of transmutation involved. Say, if the transmutation requires that someone simply change a log to a wooden horse, you would need a certain type of circle for it to be effective. However, there are still multiple ways in which some people may bypass these laws, such as Ed and Izumi Curtis (the Elric brother's mentor and a respectable alchemist herself, though she doesn't like to use it to make her life simpler) seeing the Gate of Truth in order to become as skillful in the art as they are.</p><h2>Alchemic Laws</h2><p>Though at first the power of Alchemy may seem unlimited, there are certain physical laws that it cannot bypass by any normal means. To transmute something into something else, it must have the same properties (ie the log and wooden horse) and equally importantly they need to be of the same mass. It is against the laws to transmute a log into an entire cabin, for example. The Alchemical transmutations are all based off of the four elements fire, wind, water, earth, and the circles they are placed in. All of these things heavily affect the outcome of the item. In example, say a certain circle can change a peice of iron into a hammer, and another would turn it into a spear.</p><h2>Alchemic Exceptions</h2><p>There are a certain exceptions to the entire necessity of a transmutation circle as a whole. First off, there is <a href=\"/edward-elric/29-45359/\">Edward Elric</a>, the Fullmetal alchemist. He can use Alchemy without use of a transmutation circle because he has done the unthinkable by attempting to bring back human life. Because of this, <a href=\"/edward-elric/29-45359/\">Edward Elric</a> was sent to \"The Gate\" and saw \"Truth\", a strange malevolent being that took what he wanted when he wanted. Also, Izumi Curtis, <a href=\"/edward-elric/29-45359/\">Edward Elric</a>'s teacher, has use of this along with his brother <a href=\"/alphonse/29-49317/\">Alphonse</a>, who has also seen \"Truth\". Along with seeing \"Truth\", there is also another way to use Alchemy in an instant way: the use of transmutation Circles on your arms or hands at all times. This is what Colonel <a href=\"/roy/29-49318/\">Roy</a> Mustang does to shoot the flames out of his gloves through the air and friction, a very strategic move for combat.</p><p>There is also one other way to gain power of Alchemy and bypass the laws, and that was by using the legendary artifact: The Philosopher's stone. This legendary artifact is very elusive and it seems that no one has been able to find it...it is wondered if it even exists.</p><p>There are many Alchemists in the Fullmetal Alchemist world that can perform Alchemy, also known as the devil's magic. Many people, like the Ishbalans, beleive that it is an unholy act against the Gods to change an objects form or shape, like <a href=\"/scar/29-49319/\">Scar</a>, the Ishbalan serial killer who is currently targeting the <a href=\"/state-alchemists/65-50153/\">State Alchemists</a> all across Central due to his holy beliefs of the God of Ishbala.</p><h2>Notable Users</h2><p><a href=\"/edward-elric/29-45359/\">Edward Elric</a>- he is able to use Alchemy without a trnsmutation circle, as he saw \"Truth\" when he went through the gate after he tried to bring his mother Back to life...at the expense of his left leg. He would later lose his arm by trying to save his brother <a href=\"/alphonse/29-49317/\">Alphonse</a> Elric, as rather than him losing a limb like Ed did, <a href=\"/alphonse/29-49317/\">Alphonse</a> lost his whole body.</p><p><a href=\"/roy/29-49318/\">Roy</a>-uses the trnsmutation circles on his gloves and the friction from when he snaps his fingers to create fire in dry air. He is all but usesless in the rain.</p><p><a href=\"/scar/29-49319/\">Scar</a> - his right arm is not his, it was his older brothers, who made his entire body a transmutation circle before the entire Ishbalan race was destroyed. Scar attempted to fight one of the (insane)<a href=\"/state-alchemists/65-50153/\">State Alchemists</a> as they ran from the attackers, and with two swipes of his finger his forehead basically exploded into the scar we see today. He would later lose his arm to the same <a href=\"/state-alchemists/65-50153/\">State Alchemists</a>, and his brother , knowing death was only a few hours away, <a href=\"/scar/29-49319/\">Scar</a>'s brother took off his own arm and attached it to <a href=\"/scar/29-49319/\">Scar</a> with Alchemy. This is one reason that <a href=\"/scar/29-49319/\">Scar</a> hates alchemy, but uses it, as his brother died from blood loss shortly after.</p><p><a href=\"/alphonse/29-49317/\">Alphonse</a> was originally just like any other alchemist, albeit slightly better due to the fact that alchemy kept him alive. However, after seeing one of his closest friends die, he was able to understand the Gate of Truth, the very same one which Ed saw when he tried to bring their mother back to life. This now allows for Al to use Alchemy without a circle, just like Izumi Curtis and Ed.</p><h2>Equivalent Exchange</h2><p>Equivalent Exchange was the idea from the anime of the Fullmetal Alchemist series that most alchemists referred to when explaining the laws of alchemy and in many forms of trade in real life, always saying that in order for them to do something they need the right materials. In essence, they meant that a river couldn't come from a raindrop, at least. not from them. They would need the appropriate amount of a certain element before attempting a transmutation at all, if not, the transmutation would simply cancel out, or, in much more serious attempts, the effects would be much, much more drastic, such as losing organs like Ed and Al and Izumi did in their try at bringing a human being back to life. This resulted in a lot of things happening, but none of them being positive to the slightest extent. In the anime, an attempt like this simply made a homonculus, but it has nothing to do with that as far as we know in the manga series, and doesn't even seem to really make an indifference, as the things that people have always brought back, as far as Ed and Al know, have only been random human parts, only barely even resembling the original person at all. In fact, Ed was put through much hardship when he discovered that the thing that he brought back from the dead was not his mother at all, meaning that the equivalent exchange didn't exist in that trade at all, giving him nothing and taking nearly everything.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Though the Force was thought to flow through every living thing, it could only be harnessed by beings described as \"Force-sensitive\". This Force-sensitivity was correlated with, and sometimes attributed to, a high count of internal microorganisms called midi-chlorians that were found in a Force-sensitive's blood: the higher the count, the greater the being's potential Force ability, though there were some exceptions to this rule. Force-sensitive beings were able to tap into the Force to perform acts of great skill and agility as well as control and shape the world around them. Sometimes this ability was described as having a strong Force \"aura\".</p><h2><b>The Living Force</b></h2><p>The Living Force was a view on the Force , accepted by the majority of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jedi-order/65-41234/\">Jedi</a> throughout ages. The Living Force was thought to be present in most living beings, surrounding and penetrating them, thus making all living things connected by it. The Jedi believing in the Living Force relied on their instincts and were attuned to other living beings around them. They were mindful of the future and the possible consequences of their actions, but remained focused on the present. The Living Force was viewed as having both the light and the dark side. The Jedi always had to be mindful of their actions to avoid the temptations of the dark side. Through following the Living Force, several Jedi were able to retain their identities after their physical death, becoming one with the Force and able to manifest themselves as Force ghosts. Proponents of the Living Force view, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/qui-gon-jinn/29-5411/\">Qui-Gon Jinn</a>, espoused a philosophy of \"living in the moment,\" relied heavily on their instincts and concentrated more on sensitivity to living things, rather than fulfilling destiny, which was one of the main tenets of the Unifying Force philosophy.</p><h2><b>The light side of the Force</b></h2><p>The light side of the Force was concerned with the ideals of good, benevolence, and healing. Followers of the light side strove to live in harmony with the world around them, acting out of wisdom and logic rather than anger and hasty judgment. In order to achieve harmony with the light side of the Force, its practitioners would often meditate to clear themselves of emotion; particularly negative emotions such as aggression, fear, anger, and hatred, since these were thought to bring on acceptance of the dark side.</p><p>The largest group of proponents and teachers of the light side was the Jedi Order, who strove to maintain peace and justice throughout the galaxy. The values of the light side were culminated in the Jedi Code. The Jedi accepted the view on the two sides of the Force: the dark side and the light side. A follower of the light side tried to live in harmony with those around him. Mutual trust, respect, and the ability to form alliances gave the Jedi their distinct advantage over the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-sith/65-44460/\">Sith</a>. In contrast, a follower of the dark side uses the dark side of the force, usually for himself. Use of the dark side of the Force was forbidden within the Jedi Order, and was strictly considered the domain of the Sith.</p><p>Traditional Jedi were keen to keep the Force \"in balance\". They attempted to achieve this by destroying the Sith and denying the dark side\u2014essentially \"keeping balance\" by restoring the Force to its natural state, as they viewed the dark side as \"corruption\". This involved the purging of negative emotions such as aggression, anger, and hatred, since they could easily bring on acceptance of the dark side. In contrast, positive emotions such as compassion and courage nurtured the light side of the Force. The Jedi Code compared such feelings and provided insight into the ethical use of the Force.</p><p>Passion was considered dangerous, as it could lead to strong emotions that could unbalance the Jedi and lead them to the Dark Side. Love was, curiously enough, seen as something both Jedi and Sith avoided. While the Jedi espoused a broad, all-encompassing, self-sacrificing love for all beings, love for another being\u2014romance, a possessive love by nature\u2014was shunned in post-Ruusan order. Possession of all types was also shunned in the post-Ruusan Reformation era Jedi Order, the only exceptions being a Jedi's lightsaber and clothes. The Jedi viewed love as a danger best left untouched. While the passion that came with love could lead to hatred and anger\u2014as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-vader/29-6342/\">Anakin Skywalker</a> demonstrated in becoming a Sith because of his love for Padm\u00e9 Amidala; it could also lead to pity, mercy, self-sacrifice and compassion, emotions the Sith did not see as beneficial, as demonstrated by Darth Vader in sacrificing himself to save his son from the Emperor at the end of his life, thus bringing balance to the Force.</p><h2><b>The dark side of the Force</b></h2><p>The dark side of the Force was considered by the Jedi to be the element aligned with fear, hatred, aggression, and malice toward all living things. Such emotions seemed to increase the strength and abilities of a user of the dark side, providing a path towards personal power and the destruction or control of all opposition. It was generally accepted that use of the dark side of the Force was extremely addictive. Dark side Jedi were known as Dark Jedi. Some light Jedi, such as Jaden Korr and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-apprentice/29-49602/\">Galen Marek</a>, could use dark side powers.</p><p>The Dark Lord <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-bane/29-44794/\">Darth Bane</a> considered the Force to be finite and thus ideally for exclusive use by the Dark Lord. He eliminated the practice of having vast numbers of Sith at the same time, thereby aiming to concentrate the dark side of the Force into two individuals: a Sith Master and his or her apprentice. This tradition, or \"<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rule-of-two/12-53453/\">Rule of Two</a>,\" later underwent a small reformation by Dark Lady <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shira-elan-colla-brie/29-63956/\">Lumiya</a>, following the deaths of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emperor-palpatine/29-16164/\">Darth Sidious</a> and Darth Vader (the Sith Lords at the time) in 4 ABY. The Rule of Two was later rejected by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-krayt/29-45364/\">Darth Krayt</a>, who instituted the Rule of One, using \"One\" to refer to the Sith Order itself and encompassing many minions, acolytes/adepts and lords, led by only one Dark Lord of the Sith (or Dread Lord). Darth Krayt believed he gave the Sith and their power a purpose, unlike Darth Bane, who believed that power was its own purpose. The Rule of One called for cooperation and even some level of loyalty between the Sith. However, the Rule of One did not represent the Sith as a whole, and Krayt was even labeled a heretic by the holocrons of Darth Bane, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-nihilus/29-47874/\">Darth Nihilus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-andeddu/29-52704/\">Darth Andeddu</a>.</p><h2><b>The Unifying Force</b></h2><p>The concept of the Unifying Force found fewer supporters within the Jedi Order than the Living Force. The concept of the Unifying Force was that the Force is a single entity and has neither a light nor the dark side. The Unifying Force was viewed as a deity that neither had sides nor chose them, treating all beings equally. Followers of the Unifying Force always kept their eyes open for future possibilities. In the end, it resulted in them trying to fulfill a destiny rather than focusing on here and now, as the Living Force supporter would do.</p><p>Visions of the future were of particular significance to Unifying Force supporters. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yoda/29-5396/\">Yoda</a> was one of the most adamant proponents of heeding visions of the future though never once acknowledged any of the other views common with the Unifying Force. Many of the Jedi held a similar philosophy, and focused on the flow of time as a whole, ignoring primary use of the Living Force. Voices for the latter espoused a philosophy of \"live for the moment\" and heavily relied on their instincts. This viewpoint might have allowed the Jedi Order to stave off the conflict that gave rise to the Galactic Empire, as its members lost themselves in looking forward rather than analyzing the unfolding events before them. Yoda later espoused beliefs closer to the philosophy of the Living Force when training <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-skywalker/29-6315/\">Luke Skywalker</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagobah/34-56380/\">-</a>.</p><p>Ironically for Unifying Force Jedi, Emperor Palpatine, also known as Darth Sidious, also supported this belief. He claimed that there was only one Force: the only difference worthy of note was that the Sith saw the Force as a means to an end while the Jedi saw it as an end in itself. This view was also supported by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vergere/29-64354/\">Vergere</a>, who taught <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jacen-solo/29-47939/\">Jacen Solo</a> that there was no light side or dark side of the Force, only the Unifying Force. Vergere also told Solo that \"the Force was everything, and everything was the Force\"; that the Force did not have sides and never took sides.</p><h2><b>The Potentium</b></h2><p>The Potentium view of the Force, not to be confused with the Unifying Force, was strictly disapproved by the old Jedi Order. While similar to the Unifying Force, which suggested that there was only one Force that did not take sides, the Potentium view stated that the Force and the galaxy in general were inherently good. According to this belief, the so-called dark side was not made up of specific \"parts\" or \"abilities\" of the Force: as espoused by the Light Side, it existed inside the life form which used it, made from their emotions. By that standard, and unlike the Light Side, all Potentium followers could perform any action and use the Force in any way they saw fit, as long as the intention behind it was good. In contrast, the Old Jedi Order acknowledged the existence of Potentium, but made it clear that it was subverting of the Jedi teaching and a way to misguide people to the dark side, or a means to serve it. The living planet Zonama Sekot supported the Potentium theory of the Force as well.</p><h2><b>Way of the Dark</b></h2><p>The Way of the Dark, or simply the Dark, was a view of the Force taken up by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lord-cronal/29-52678/\">Cronal</a> and those that taught him. It was effectively the polar opposite of the Potentium, but taken a step further. This Way of the Dark belief did not just deny the existence of the Light side of the Force; it stated that the Force itself was simply a small extension of the Dark. This system stated that destruction was the universal constant that all things worked towards, going so far as to call it the \"will of the universe\". An initiate was taught that if one made destruction his primary goal, with whatever scheme he was taking part in being a secondary objective, then the Dark would effectively reward the initiate for the devastation caused by pushing the secondary objective to success.</p><p>As a prime example of this, Cronal cited that Palpatine was able to achieve success against the Jedi and the Republic because his primary motive was the destruction of both parties. However, once he had achieved these goals and set about consolidating his rule and building the Empire, his focus shifted from destruction to creation, in total opposition to universal processes. Thus when before he could not fail, now he could never succeed.</p><h2><b>The Insidious Force</b></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-traya/29-71462/\">Darth Traya</a>, a female Sith living during the Old Sith Wars, believed the Force to be akin to some sort of deceptively sinister, indifferent god. She pointed to the numerous wars fought by countless Force users, as proof that the Force cared nothing for the lives it consumed, so long as balance was achieved. This philosophy emphasized the belief that neither the light nor the dark side was truly superior to the other, and that if people were to be truly free, the Force had to be eliminated from the galaxy. This was generally a very unpopular theory with both the Sith and the Jedi, and this practice practically disappeared entirely with Traya's death.</p><h2><b>Beliefs of the Aing-Tii</b></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1483897\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71675/1483897-aingtiimonks_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1483897\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71675/1483897-aingtiimonks_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The Aing-Tii monks from the Kathol Rift viewed the Force in a way different, but similar to the view of the Jedi. Instead of the dark and the light sides of the Force, they viewed it as having many colors, much like a rainbow. They believed that the Force could manifest itself in different ways, which allowed a being to develop unique abilities, unknown to most of the Jedi and the Sith. They believed the force was much too complicated to be just light or dark. According to their beliefs, Force-users were not strictly good or evil, but instead had their place in a larger spectrum.</p><h2><b>White Current</b></h2><p>The Fallanassi called the Force the White Current and saw it like the river flowing through the galaxy and all living beings. A single person could not alter the current any more than a being could divert a river with one hand. Thus, the Fallanassi immersed themselves in the Current, letting it flow through them. This way they managed to shape its flow without imposing their will on it, which also opened them a way for unique Force abilities.</p><h2><b>Sorcerers of Tund</b></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1483899\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71675/1483899-466px_sorcerer_of_tund_egf_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1483899\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71675/1483899-466px_sorcerer_of_tund_egf_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The Sorcerers of Tund shared most of the Sith beliefs, which was not surprising, given the fact that their order was founded by sith mages. However, they viewed the force as the magical power and manipulated it mostly by arcane symbols and spells. The Jedi viewed the sorcerers as merely another Force sect, but would often try to \"convert\" the Sorcerers, attempting to convince them to use the Force without any of their trappings of magic and mysticism. However, they were unsuccessful, and eventually the Jedi contented themselves with making sure the Sorcerers did not descend into the dark side.</p><h2>Abilities The Force Provides</h2><h3>Enhanced Reflexes</h3><p>Jedi and Sith have both displayed reflexes and reactions beyond that of a normal being in Star Wars, whether it is through their dodging and deflecting of blasters, fantastic flying skills or high speed lightsaber duels, it is evident in most things they do.</p><h3>Enhanced Motion</h3><p>All force users have the ability to use the force to augment their bodily kinetics. Most frequently shown of which is the force jump whereby force users call upon the force to aid them in jumping unnaturally high. The maximum height a force user can jump correlates to their strength in the use of the force. Force-Users can also use Force Sprint, this enables them to move across large surfaces very quickly and is extremely useful in the battlefield. They can also enhance agility. Most obvious example of which is Grand Master <a href=\"/yoda/29-5396/\">Yoda</a> who frequently leaps around during duels, despite his 900 years of age.</p><h3>Telepathy</h3><p>All force users have the ability to influence other people's minds. This is a particularly helpful skill for getting into locked down places, being stealthy and covering your tracks. Most famous example of this is Ben Kenobi's \"These are not the droids you are looking for\". Despite being ability to influence decision making, they cannot however read minds or thoughts.</p><h3>Telekinesis</h3><p>This is the most renowned of the Force abilities. All force users have the ability to do this, however the volume and size of what they lift is dependant upon their raw force potential and their training. Most Force users attempt at first to lift rocks or pebbles, advancing to ships such as an <a href=\"/x-wing-starfighter/18-55764/\">X-Wing (like</a> <a href=\"/luke-skywalker/29-6315/\">Luke Skywalker</a> did). The majority of Jedi will use telekinesis if they throw their lightsaber, or in Luke's case if they are directing a bomb into the Death Star, Greatest feats of telekinesis include Master Yoda lifting up a pillar that would've otherwise crushed Obi-Wan and Anakin.</p><h3>Force Lightning</h3><p>This is used exclusively by the Sith and is their most renowned weapon (after the red lightsaber). This involves creating a series of lightning bolts from your hands and projecting them at anything. These can be highly powerful, and are used by Sith Masters due to the difficulty of creating them. They are impossible for a jedi knight to dodge, however some masters like <a href=\"/mace-windu/29-5395/\">Mace Windu</a> and Yoda have displayed the ability to block Force lightning with lightsaber, or simply in Yoda's case with his bare hands.</p><h3>Precognition</h3><p>The Force can provide highly skilled force users with a glimpse or sense of the future or what is coming.</p><h3>Force Healing</h3><p>This is a useful tool for all force users, this allows the advanced of healing of all wounds, however due to the difficulty of it and the fatigue induced by it, most healing is normally left to Bacta Tanks</p><h3>Force Choke</h3><p>Another famous move. This is used exclusively by Sith and Dark Jedi. This allows the wielder to cut of oxygen and levitate their victims, quickly killing them.</p><h3>Force Crush</h3><p>This has been used very infrequently due to the fact that it is highly tiring. Most notably used by Master Mace Windu during his duel with General Grievous. He crushed the cyborg's internal organs particularly his lungs. Hence his wheezing cough throughout the third film.</p><h3>Force Storm</h3><p>This creates a black hole/worm hole and is the hardest of all force moves and has been used by Darth Nihilus alone.</p>",

The pilot normally sits in a pod accessed from the rear or top of the Fuchikoma. The A.I. is sophisticated enough that the tanks exhibit emotions and a child-like personality. They are equiped with four agile supports, or legs, that enable them to walk as well as ride using extendable wheels. They are designed to be able to easily cross a variety of different terrains. They also have two robotic arms with finger-like extensions. On the head and torso are lenses and sensors which guide the Fuchikoma and can be used by the pilot.</p><p>The Fuchikoma are used for combat and therefore have a range of weapon systems such as machine guns, grappling guns with hardened cables, and grenade launchers. Since the Fuchikoma possess an A.I. and emotions however, they are closely monitored for any signs of instability. They are also synchronized after missions so that their experiences are shared and they can learn from one another. They also tend to be a source of humor in the manga and anime adaptions.</p><p>In the Stand Alone Complex anime series the Fuchikoma were known as Tachikoma, and as Uchikoma in the second series and the Solid State Society film.

        "description":"<p>There are hundreds to thousands of jutsu in the Narutoverse that involve anything from crushing people with sand to cloning yourself with the energy. These jutsu require hand-signs and focusing <a href=\"../../chakra/12-46239/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chakra</a> to make them work. Jutsus that don't require hand signs-are uncommon.</p><p>There are 12 hand-seals, each one named after an animal in the Chinese zodiac. Each hand-seals deals with a specific use (for examples: the Tiger hand-seal is often used for Katons and the Snake for Dotons) and thus numerous hand-seals are sometimes required for a single technique to get the desired outcome. Kakashi's \"Chidori\" for example requires the combination of Ox Rabbit Monkey, in that order.</p><p>There are five types of jutsu: Ninjutsu, the basic power arts... think \"magic\" in a sense; Taijutsu, martial arts that don't require any hand signs to complete; Genjutsu, illusionary techniques where by manipulating anothers' five senses through controlling their flow of chakra to the brain; Fuuinjutsu, drawing symbols which act similarly to ninjutsu; and Kuchiyose, the ability to warp time &amp; space to summon aid in battle.</p><p>Elemental jutsu are divided into five categories: Katon (fire release), Fuuton (wind release), Raiton (lightning release), Doton (earth release), and Suiton (water release). Each one beats the one to it's right and loses to it's left, thus having water circle around into beating fire. People in the Narutoverse are born with a specific elemental affinity, allowing them to learn that element easier than any other and use more powerful jutsus with that element than any other. Using different elemental jutsus is done by recomposing their chakra into the element they want, which is not easy to learn.</p><p>A key way to find out what elemental affinity a ninja has is by holding a piece of paper and focusing their chakra into it and watch what happens: Katon causes the paper to burn, Fuuton causes the paper to tear, Raiton causes the paper to crinkle, Doton causes the paper to crumble, and Suiton causes the paper to moisten.</p><p>There are also cerain types of techniques called Kekkai Genkai, it literally means \"blood-line trait\" and only members of a certain family can use it; like <a href=\"../../kimimaro/29-44262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kimimaro</a> and his bone manipulation ability, or <a href=\"../../sasuke/29-44241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sasuke</a> and <a href=\"../../itachi/29-44260/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Itachi</a>'s <a href=\"../../sharingan/18-44263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sharingan</a> eyes, or others such as The Third Kazekage possessed the ability to alter his chakra into magnetic fields and control metal. There are also Kekkei Genkais that gives the user dual affinities, which can be combined by the user to create a new element, such as in the case of <a href=\"../../haku/29-44244/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Haku</a> whom can use Hyouton (ice release) ninjutsu by combining Suiton and Fuuton, or <a href=\"../../the-first-hokage/29-49812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The First Hokage</a> whom could use Mokuton (wood release) ninjutsu by combining Doton and Suiton.</p><p>Ok guys, I'll do my best to list these as efficiently as possible by splitting them into specific groups (Note: The Kekkai Genkai are only the jutsu that are enabled by the kekkai genkai-NOT the item itself, like the <a href=\"../../sharingan/18-44263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sharingan</a> eyes or the <a href=\"../../byakugan/18-44521/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Byakugan</a>; these have separate pages for a reason).</p><p><b>SPOILERS BELOW</b></p><h2>Ninjutsu</h2><h3><u><b>A</b></u></h3><p>Act of Tree Walking: A basic jutsu where by focusing chakra a ninja is able to scale virtually any surface.</p><p>Used By: Everyone</p><p>Act of Water Walking: A basic jutsu where by focusing chakra a ninja is able to stand on top of water.</p><p>Used By: Everyone</p><p>Adamantine Staff: Transforms the user into a nearly indestructible, size-altering rod.

They do not need chakra, but their strength can be enhanced by the use of chakra in the blows. Some taijutsu however do require the use of chakra to be effective.</p><p>Front Lotus: This Taijutsu attack is a very dangerous attack which needs the release of your first <a href=\"../../chakra/12-46239/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chakra</a> Gate. It is one of the most common attacks employed by Rock <a href=\"../../lee/29-44527/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lee</a>, but it has also been used by <a href=\"../../might-guy/29-48904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Might Guy</a> and <a href=\"../../kakashi/29-44243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kakashi</a>. It is a two part attack, each of which is listed below:</p><ul><li><p>Shadow of the Dancing Leaf: The shadow of the Dancing leaf is a quick upward kick into an opponent's chin, vaulting them into the air, where the user will then quickly jump up behind them, making any defense by the enemy difficult.</p></li><li><p>Pile driver: In this step, the person employing the use of this Jutsu will wrap something around the opponent (in the case of <a href=\"../../lee/29-44527/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lee</a>, he uses his arm bandages). The employer of the Jutsu will the wrap their arms around their opponent, and begin spinning them rapidly towards the ground. Right before impact, The employer will then kick off of the opponent, and the Opponent will land head-first into the ground, causing serious harm to the enemy.</p></li><li><p>Used By: Lee</p></li></ul><p>The full Front lotus is a B-rank attack</p><p>Gentle Fist: This Technique is a fighting style meant to be incorporated with the <a href=\"../../byakugan/18-44521/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Byakugan</a> eye, and is taught to every member of the Hyuga clan. Using the <a href=\"../../byakugan/18-44521/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Byakugan</a>, the user locates the chakra points in the opponents body and uses multiple strikes to each point to block it off. This leaves the opponent unable to use his Chakra, and leaving him defenseless from any future attack.</p><p>Used By: Hinata, Hiashi, Neji</p><p>Lion Barrage: This Jutsu is an attack created by Uchiha <a href=\"../../sasuke/29-44241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sasuke</a> after seeing the Front Lotus. The beginning of the attack is the same as that of the Front Lotus, using the Shadow of the Dancing Leaf, but instead of following it up with a pile driver, the user attacks the opponent with a barrage of attacks, the first one a strike to the side (Mean to be blocked), before following it up with two hand strikes. The final attack is a kick to the stomach, sending the opponent into the ground at high speeds. The Lion Barrage is a C-rank attack.</p><p>Used By: Sasuke</p><p>Morning Peacock: The user moves their fists so fast that they create fire from the friction, enhancing the power of the strikes.</p><p>Used By: Gai</p><p>Noon Tiger: This uses wind pressure in the shape of a tiger's head to attack the opponent, it condenses into a single point and then explodes.</p><p>Used By: Gai</p><p>Reverse Lotus: This technique is one of the most dangerous Taijutsu techniques, needing for the opening of at least three chakra gates, which is in itself a feat. The user will then launch their enemy into the air, and following them, delivering a shattering blow which will launch them into the ground, usually being fatal to the opponent. The attack is a gamble, though, since the releasing of so many Chakra Gates at once will leave the user drained and very susceptible to attack.</p><p>Used By: Lee</p><p>Then, of course, there are the techniques that require no chakra at all, mainly because they are not taught anywhere and do not really provide an edge in any fight. These are the simple taijutsu moves that are more like brawling then they are martial arts, like Naruto's star kick that seemed never to fail to get him into a battle, and get the upperhand at the same time. Naruto used some techniques that never seemed to be anything like martial arts for the duration of part I. Then there were Itachi's kicks that, unseemingly, were really just brute force and no real graceful intent behind them.</p><h2>Eight Gates</h2><p>They are eight important chakra points in the body. This is what limits the chakra in your body. So if you use it you have limits. After you use this it makes your body weaker. If you uses this you can pass the normal physical standards, but have extreme pain to the body. Rock Lee is one who can open open the 5 gates only for now. Might Guy, the one who even taught Lee about this, can open 6. Kakashi Hatake can only open 1, this is proven because while he was rock climbing it shows in his brain the first gate activating.</p><h3>The First Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Opening, this frees the brain limit on all the strains and muscles, giving the user 5 times more speed and strength.</p><h3>The Second Gate</h3><p>This is called the Gate of Rest, you release the brain limit on your stamina, If the user was exhausted and ready to quit in an instant he would want to fight like the fight didn't even start yet.</p><h3>The Third Gate</h3><p>This is called the Gate of Life, this gate is in your spinal cord, and frees the limit to your nervous system through out your body. This makes information faster and builds more stamina. The side-effect of this is your body's skin will turn red because your building your blood-oxygen rate.</p><h3>The Fourth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Pain, It releases the limit oxygen going to your lungs, making more oxygen for the users body to use.</p><h3>The Fifth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Closing, this frees the amount of chakra you can use in one attack, this allows you to move the speed of sound.</p><h3>The Sixth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Joy, this takes away the amount of fat and protein your body can digest. And releasing useless energy resources giving the person more power and more stamina.</p><h3>The Seventh Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Shock, this takes away the amount your body can move, it takes away your dead skin cells to fences and refresh your system making your body more power and more stamina.</p><h3>The Eighth Gate</h3><p>This gate is called the Gate of Death, this is the last gate, it is at the heart and uses your whole body's energy, it makes your heart pump at its fullest speed and passes all the 1-7 gates. It uses every cell in your body. There is side-effect of this called the Big Bang it kills every muscle in the body and the heart. Its a certified death on the user if the Gate of Death is ever opened.</p><p><b>Used by:</b> Lee &amp; Might Guy &amp; Kakashi</p>",
