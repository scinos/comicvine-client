After much planning, expense and hard work; the ship was built and was nearing its launch date. However, as the launch neared, the federal government was about to cut funding for the flight. Reed decided there was no choice but to launch the ship before the whole effort was scrapped and wasted.</p><p>Reed invited his girlfriend Susan Storm along for the trip and her brother Johnny Storm insisted on coming along in order to keep her safe. Wanting a pilot with both the ability and the guts to make the flight, Reed turned to his former college roommate and very close friend Ben Grimm, a highy accomplished former test pilot for the United States Air Force. The crew now set, everyone was ready for launch when Reed received a warning from the authorities concerning the effects of the cosmic rays on human bodies so far out in space. Reed's request for launch was denied and the mission aborted.</p><p>More desperate than ever to make the flight, Reed's crew waited until the changing of the guards that night and then sneaked onto the ship and launched before any planes could be scrambled to intercept them and/or shoot them down using missiles. Successful in leaving the Earth's atmosphere, they were halfway along on their mission when they entered a sub-space storm and were bombarded by intense cosmic rays both before they expected and stronger than they expected. This unexpectedly intense cosmic ray storm had strange and disorienting effects on the crew, making them unable to continue the trip. They turned back, returned to Earth and crash-landed in a small opening in a forested area.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1248591\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o_super.jpg\" title=\"The Birth of the Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1248591\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Birth of the Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Birth of the Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>Luckily, they survived the crash but were radically changed. Ben felt his body become heavy and found he'd turned into a monster. Reed tried to calm him down and restrain him when he realized that he'd reflexively stretched and wrapped his body around Ben; he now had elastic stretching abilities. Johnny burst into flames while Sue panicked and turned invisible. Gathering their wits, they soon managed to calm themselves and agreed to use their new-found powers for the good of humanity and stay together as a team. Johnny called himself the \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a>,\" Sue took the name \"Invisible Girl\" (and later changed it to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>). Ben chose the name \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing\"</a> and Reed decided to call himself \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>.\" Thus, the Fantastic Four were born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Fantastic Four was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/49-2045/\">Fantastic Four</a> #1, November 1961. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four after seeing what a success <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics'</a> <a href=\"/justice-league/65-55928/\">Justice League</a> was. While this is no doubt true, it has also been rumored for years that Stan actually patterned the FF team after DC's Sea Devils team and The Challengers of the unknown. Looking at the composition of both teams, there are a lot of similarities, so this rumor could well be correct.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1189434\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189434-ff_vs_mm_super.jpg\" title=\"Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\"><img id=\"1189434\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189434-ff_vs_mm_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man</div></div></div></div><p>The first family super team of Marvel Comics, the <b>Fantastic Four</b> opened up the genre to a whole new way of telling the old story of family binds above all else. The Fantastic Four as a team made their public debut when a villain named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mole-man/29-2481/\">Mole Man</a> (A villain that lives underground) began attacking the surface. The Fantastic Four continued their illustrious careers as superheroes and unlike <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, they were well loved by the public and the media by appearing on television and more.</p><p>Reed Richards also created the \u201c <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/unstable-molecules/18-54225/\">unstable molecules</a>\u201d which are used for their costumes. This allows Reed\u2019s costume to stretch as he does, Invisible Girl\u2019s goes invisible when she does, and Human Torch\u2019s doesn\u2019t burn up when he flames on. Reed would also discover <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">The Negative Zone</a> ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> shared credit for the creation of the Negative Zone and unstable molecules). The Negative Zone is a parallel universe in which all matter is negatively charged. It also has a breathable atmosphere which allows Mr. Fantastic to lead his team in adventures in the Negative Zone. The Negative Zone is mostly uninhabited and Reed was eventually able to map out most of the area.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216479\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" title=\"FF 38 (1965) - captive Sue laying next to the Q-bomb\"><img id=\"2216479\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216479-ff_38___a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 38 (1965) - captive Sue laying next to the Q-bomb\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 38 (1965) - captive Sue laying next to the Q-bomb</div></div></div></div><p>One of the most important issues of the Silver Age was FF 38, \"Defeated by the Frightful Four\". This is the first issue where the FF are actually defeated by the end of the story. Medusa shows superb cunning by creating a trap for the Invisible Girl. She lures Sue to an East Side fashion house, on the pretext of showing her some wedding dresses. When Sue arrives, Medusa captures her easily with her deadly red hair and the Trapster makes certain the blonde girl cannot escape by shooting her with his paste gun. The Wizard flies himself, Sue and his two partners up into the air. The Frightful Four take an unconscious Invisible Girl to an isolated Pacific island and then go into an underground chamber. Wizard directs Trapster to place the girl down next to the detonation mechanism of a powerful nuclear Q-bomb! The Fantastic Four follow in an attempt to rescue Sue. However, after a brief battle, the Frightful Four escape, leaving the FF on the island. Fortunately Sue's partners find her just in time and Reed gets Sue to use her force field. The bomb explodes. While the FF survive, they have lost their powers. Daredevil then assists them in FF 39-40, as the FF try and avoid death at the hands of Doctor Doom. They do not regain their powers until late in issue 40.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216525\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216525-ff___annual_6.jpg\" title=\"FF Annual 6 - The birth of Franklin Richards\"><img id=\"2216525\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216525-ff___annual_6_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF Annual 6 - The birth of Franklin Richards\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF Annual 6 - The birth of Franklin Richards</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1174781\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b_super.jpg\" title=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\"><img id=\"1174781\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF Annual 3 - Sue & Reed are married</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216455\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216455-ff_81___crystal.jpg\" title=\"FF 81 - Crystal replaces Sue and then she saves the FF from the Wizard\"><img id=\"2216455\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216455-ff_81___crystal_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 81 - Crystal replaces Sue and then she saves the FF from the Wizard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 81 - Crystal replaces Sue and then she saves the FF from the Wizard</div></div></div></div><p>Reed and Sue eventually married in 1965 and it became a celebrity event. The couple continued their newly married life in the public eye for years to come. Later Sue would become pregnant with a baby boy whom would be named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>. Due to Sue being pregnant, she had to take a temporary leave on the team. To take Sue's place, the Fantastic Four decided to recruit the Human Torch\u2019s girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a>. However due to the pollution on Earth, Crystal was forced to leave the Fantastic Four soon after. Sue eventually gave birth to Franklin on 1968 in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four-annual/49-2129/\">Fantastic Four Annual</a> #6, and returned as an active member on the Fantastic Four. Lee and Kirby ended their run when Kirby left Marvel in 1970.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216460\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216460-ff130_breakup.jpg\" title=\"FF 130 - Sue and Reed separate\"><img id=\"2216460\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216460-ff130_breakup_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 130 - Sue and Reed separate\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 130 - Sue and Reed separate</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2221330\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" title=\"Medusa tells Reed she will replace his estranged wife\"><img id=\"2221330\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Medusa tells Reed she will replace his estranged wife\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Medusa tells Reed she will replace his estranged wife</div></div></div></div><p>Sue and Richards\u2019 relationship eventually became dysfunctional because Sue began hating the life of a celebrity. Feeling angry she was not treated as an equal, Sue left the Fantastic Four at the end of Fantastic Four 130 and the Inhuman named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a> would fill in for Sue while she took a break. Sue eventually returned to active duty in the Fantastic Four again, but only after Namor staged a fight with Mr. Fantastic in issue #149. Sue did not return to active FF duty for several more issues after the reconciliation. The separation between Sue and Reed lasted for 19 issues. This is really significant, as it means the separation lasted for one year and 7 months. This was a very harsh break-up that could easily have ended in Sue and Reed getting a divorce. The fans seemed to side with Mr. Fantastic in the break-up and against the Invisible Girl. The Fantastic Four Fan Page in issue #152 actually had a shocking letter which urged the writers to kill Sue off and the FF Bullpen implied that a few other fans had also urged them to kill Sue, though not as many as had called for Sue and Reed to divorce. The Fan Page editorial staff went on to say that the consensus was that they had to find a way to make Sue think again, implying that perhaps the gorgeous blonde had not been thinking straight when she left Reed and the team. Medusa did perform in a satisfactory manner in Sue's absence, though she did not demonstrate the awesome power that Crystal did, when Crystal replaced Sue a few years earlier, due to Sue's maternity leave with baby Franklin Richards.</p><p>During the 1970s the Fantastic Four had many artists and writers who would continue the Fantastic Four\u2019s public career as superheroes. A roster change would come up when the Thing temporarily lost his powers. Reed decided to hire mercenary Power Man ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>) to fill in for Ben.</p><p>Reed eventually finished developing an exoskeleton that mimics his strength as the Thing, and Ben returns to the Fantastic Four as an active member. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-byrne/26-1770/\">John Byrne</a> would take over the Fantastic Four in the 1980s where critics would call \u201cthe best</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1189423\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189423-102_spider_man___the_secret_wars_1_super.jpg\" title=\"The Secret Wars\"><img id=\"1189423\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189423-102_spider_man___the_secret_wars_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Secret Wars\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Secret Wars</div></div></div></div><p>run since Lee and Kirby.\u201d Byrne was most celebrated for his modernization of Invisible Girl.

During their time in the Secret Wars, the Thing was able to change to his human form and the Thing form at will. After the heroes were victorious against the Beyonder, the Thing decided to stay on the alien planet as he was happy to be able to change his forms at will. When the Fantastic Four returned to Earth, they recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> to fill-in for the Thing.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1228622\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1228622-fantasticfour_v1_279_p12_super.jpg\" title=\"She-Hulk replaces Thing spot in the Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1228622\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1228622-fantasticfour_v1_279_p12_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"She-Hulk replaces Thing spot in the Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">She-Hulk replaces Thing spot in the Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>Later, Sue would appear to have become pregnant with a second child but instead, Sue suffered a miscarriage.

However, Dr. Doom mutated her even more and she eventually left for good. Franklin Richards was later kidnapped by a time-traveler named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nathaniel-richards/29-7221/\">Nathaniel Richards</a> (Father of Reed Richards) and took him to the future to raise him there. He brought Franklin back as a teenager, who dubbed himself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Psi-Lord</a>.</p><p>It was later revealed that in a future time-line, Franklin would father a child with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a> who would become a super villain named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hyperstorm/29-11832/\">Hyperstorm</a>. For a time, it had appeared that Mr. Fantastic was killed by Dr. Doom, who also was badly wounded and dying. However, it was later revealed that Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom were not dead, but were kidnapped by Hyperstorm right before their deaths. The Fantastic Four eventually discovered this and were able to free Reed and defeat Hyperstorm with the help of Galactus.</p><p>When the team returned back to Earth, Nathaniel decided to revert Franklin back to his original age as a child. The Fantastic Four would later battle the psychic being known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a>. Onslaught was too powerful for the Fantastic Four and all the heroes of Earth, it became a losing battle. However, the heroes devised a plan to defeat Onslaught but at the cost of all non-mutant hero lives. The Fantastic Four and all the heroes decided to sacrifice themselves in order to destroy Onslaught and were seemingly killed in the process.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"232407\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught_super.jpg\" title=\"Heroes vs. Onslaught\"><img id=\"232407\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes vs. Onslaught\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heroes vs. Onslaught</div></div></div></div><p>Since Reed had developed so many advanced technologies, the Government attempted to seize all his equipment, however Nathaniel traveled back to this reality and stored all of Reed\u2019s equipment into the Negative Zone. However, with Franklin\u2019s reality-altering powers he was able to store all the sacrificed heroes in a pocket universe and was able to bring them back to life on this reality\u2019s Earth. The team would later return from the Heroes Reborn Earth, and have to cope with the fact that they had been considered dead for more than a year.</p><p>During this time the team resided in Pier 4, since <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/four-freedoms-plaza/34-42378/\">Four Freedoms Plaza</a> now belonged to a group of super villains, masquerading as heroes known as, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a>. It was also around this time when the team came in contact with a teenage girl calling herself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valeria-von-doom/29-18247/\">Valeria von Doom</a>, who claimed to be the daughter of Susan and Doom in the future. Sue was apprehensive at first with the girls story but eventually she and the rest of the team came to accept Valeria as both ally and friend.</p><p>In a struggle against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abraxas/29-18246/\">Abraxas</a>, Valeria forfeited her life in order to help bring back Galactus to life. But she would not die. She is transformed into the form of a fetus and transferred into Sue's womb, making Valeria's story true except for one notable difference. She had been Reed's daughter all along. Sue was pregnant again but all would not go well for the Invisible Woman. Due to Sue's cosmic radiation exposure it became difficult to give birth. With Reed away solving a world crisis, Johnny turns to Dr. Doom and asks him to help his sister. Doom was successful in the delivery but forced Sue to allow Doom to name the child. Doom would name her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valeria-richards/29-2470/\">Valeria Richards</a> after a woman that he had once loved.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192171\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192171-waid_super.jpg\" title=\"Mark Waid-Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1192171\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192171-waid_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Waid-Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mark Waid-Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mark-waid/26-40724/\">Mark Waid</a> era saw the Fantastic Four we see a lot of new concepts and amazing arcs come to light. His first stories on the book dealt with the Fantastic Four as Imaginauts and how they dealt with the fame that they always had their way. We also saw glimpses of Johnny as a much more responsible man, thanks to his sisters conjecture.</p><p>We also witness Doom's ruthlessness in trying cause harm to the Fantastic Four at any costs. He sold his loves life, Valeria (his first love) in an attempt to gain more of the magics that were always in his blood and which he denounced for a life of science. Seeing now that having both would help him in his end, he betrayed her to demons and was able to get the magical knowledge he yearned for.</p><p>To add to that, when Doom delivered baby Valeria, he cast a spell on her that would make her his magical familiar and he used the connection to carry out a devastating attack against the team. In the instant she uttered \"Doom\" demons kidnapped Franklin and Reed and Johnny tried desperately to save him before Johnny was burnt badly by demon fire. Sue and Ben hurry to Reed to tell him what's happened when they discovered Johnny wailing and notice his burnt flesh. They explain what happened and the team sets out to rescue Franklin and heal Valeria from this affliction Doom gave upon her.</p><p>They travel to Latveria where the team is ambushed by Doom. He takes Valeria and uses his magic in order to have the team suffer through painful versions of each others powers. He gives Johnny, Reed's stretching abilities, stretching him to his limits. He gives Sue a painful version of her brother's flame power. He has Ben fight off dozens of monsters. And finally he sticks Reed in a room full of magical information. But with the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, (or should I say his astral projection), Reed escapes and saves his family. Together they defeat Doom, and rescue Franklin and Valeria. Doom was vanquished and left in Hell by Reed, but not before Doom instilled a parting gift on him and scarred his face. This encounter would have lasting affects on the team and Reed.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, the super-hero community was split in two, one in favor of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human registration act</a> and the other against it. Reed sided with the Pro-Registration side along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> as team leader against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America's</a> Anti-Registration team.</p><p>A group of civilians attacked Johnny and seriously injured him because they blamed the super-heroes for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stamford-ct/34-45571/\">Stamford</a> Incident. Susan and Thing reluctantly joined Reed's side all the while looking over a hospitalized Johnny, who was seemingly neglected by Reed. Reed, Sue and Ben joined the first battle against Captain America's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> where a Cyborg <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, made by Iron Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> and Reed, joined the battle and killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a>. After witnessing this, Sue shielded Cap's team from Thor's attack, giving them the time they needed to teleport away. Although Reed tried to explain himself, Sue refused to hear any of it. She decided to turn her back on Reed, and along with Johnny, who was released from the hospital, she joined the Secret Avengers and left a note for Reed explaining her actions and begging him to spend time with the children, who were neglected by Reed since the start of this struggle. However, Ben refused to participate in this war any longer, and although he did not agree with the Registration Act, he refused to fight the Government so he left for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/france/34-55778/\">France</a>. Reed remained with Iron Man and even helped built a prison in the Negative Zone meant for the rogue heroes.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1363219\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm_super.jpg\" title=\"Reed dies saving Sue in the Civil War\"><img id=\"1363219\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Reed dies saving Sue in the Civil War\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Reed dies saving Sue in the Civil War</div></div></div></div><p>In the final battle between the two sides, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/taskmaster/29-4578/\">Taskmaster</a> shot at Sue but Reed intervened and took the bullet instead, wounding him. This angers Sue and she smashes Taskmaster down with an invisible construct. Johnny was seen attempting to ambush Iron Man from behind but failed, During the fight, Ben returned and tried to save as many people as possible from being caught in the crossfire. When Captain America decided to surrender, the heroes had to face all the destruction their fight had caused. Sue and Johnny were granted amnesty and they try to reconstruct the streets where the battle took place. In an attempt to reconcile their relationship, Reed is able to convince Sue to come back to him and go on a second honeymoon. He takes Sue to one of the moons of Saturn to try and rekindle their love, as well as give her their first true honeymoon, since they never had one. During their absence, Storm and Black Panther filled in for them along side Ben and Johnny.</p><h3>New Fantastic Four</h3><p>The new team's first mission was to find the body of their friend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gravity/29-40452/\">Gravity</a> which was taken by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/epoch/29-6143/\">Epoch</a> in the story in order to recover him as the Protector of the Universe. However, the Silver Surfer, who has returned to being a Herald of Galactus, was tracking down Epoch, in order to feed her to Galactus, seeing her as an energy source capable of fulfilling his master's hunger. The team traveled to space and confronted the Surfer who, after a brief battle with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>, agreed to help them find their friend but Epoch will be fed to Galactus. Surfer then told Thing that he is a Herald again because he realized that Galactus' is hunger is not related in the story to good or evil.</p><p>However, the recovered Gravity and the Fantastic Four refused to allow Galactus consume Epoch. The Black Panther, using a device similar to the one used by Doctor Doom that takes away the Surfer's Cosmic Powers, fought and defeated the Surfer but they were still no match for Galactus himself. Gravity used all the powers given to him by Epoch to feed Galactus, who restored the Surfer's powers and spared Epoch.</p><h3>Second Honeymoon</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216464\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" title=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\"><img id=\"2216464\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216464-ff_548___3a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again</div></div></div></div><p>In the stories, Reed takes Sue to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titan/34-41103/\">Titan</a>, one of the moons of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saturn/34-56294/\">Saturn</a>, as a means for them to have a honeymoon, since they never took one when they originally married. While there, Reed discovers a strange object and begins to examine it. Unfortunately he is unsure of it and he teleports back to Earth so other scientists can see and help him determine what it was. In order to do so, however, he left Sue alone on the ship in which they traveled to Titan, where she was ambushed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frightful-four/65-11439/\">Frightful Four</a>. Sue fought them off for as long as she could, but she was defeated. The Wizard proved his superb intellect by creating a gun which was set to the frequency of Sue's force field. One shot of the gun and Sue fell to the ground, unconscious. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/29-3287/\">Wizard</a> placed a power dampener on her, making her totally helpless. Sue was held prisoner on her own ship, all in the hopes that Sue, as well as everyone else, recognize the Wizard as Reed's superior. Sue refuses to acknowledge him as her husbands superior, and he attacks her, now that she's subdued. The slap that the Wizard gives Sue is even more brutal than the one Reed delivered to her in FF 281. So much for a second honeymoon, as Sue has become a hostage of the Frightful Four for the third time in Fantastic Four history, the other two being Silver Age FF 38 and FF: The World's Greatest Comic Magazine 9 of 12. Reed, along with Johnny, Ben, Storm, and Black Panther head for the ship to stop the Frightful Four and rescue Sue.</p><p>Sue is subjected to attacks by the Wizard but eventually Reed and the rest of the team manage to return to the ship. Once there, Storm found Sue and released her from the special machine that neutralized Sue's powers. As a means of revenge, Sue threatened the Wizard with creating a force field around his heart. The Wizard, intimidated by the more powerful Sue, subsequently faints and the Frightful Four are then rocketed out into space on a smaller vessel.</p><h3>Brand New Day</h3><p>Before the Civil War, Spider-Man's identity was shared among many super-heroes including the Fantastic Four. On one occasion they in-listed Peter's help in journeying with them to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/macroverse/34-56470/\">Macroverse</a> where they helped save a princess from a group of barbarians. During this whole encounter, Peter never wore his mask.</p><p>In present time, The Fantastic Four seek Peter's help again in journeying to the Macroverse, from where Reed received a distress signal. At first Spidey refuses to go but then accepts after Reed produces him a check to pay his bills. However, after <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/one-more-day/39-49939/\">One More Day</a>, the Fantastic Four have also forget of Spidey's identity, making the Human Torch, who was once a very close friend to both Peter and Spider-Man, very skeptical. When they arrive at the Macroverse, they discover five statues of themselves, the inhabitants of the Macroverse idolize them for their previous adventure. Once the Johnny realizes that the unmasked Spider-Man's statue's face is unrecognizable, he recalls that he once knew more about Spider-Man and wants to know what he did that caused them to forget who he is. When Spidey refuses to answer and declares that he won't go down that road again and that no one will ever know his secret, an angered Human Torch burns off Spidey's mask but Susan uses her powers to protect Peter's face and lashes out at Johnny for betraying Spidey's trust. However, they are in a war-zone between two races, and the combined might of Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four was able to return the Macroverse to peace. When they were heading back to Earth, Reed asks Spidey about his secret identity and how he was able to have everyone forget it. Spidey tells him that it was the result of a special spell that prevents anyone from knowing Peter's identity unless Peter himself unmasks. Johnny urges Peter to unmask since they're all friends but Peter still refuses until Reed tells him that he has a \"psychic firewall\" that allowing them to know his identity and keep it to themselves. Peter agrees and unmasks and they renew their friendship.</p><h3>Planet Hulk &amp; World War Hulk</h3><p>The Hulk, who is now under the control of Banner, was sent to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/las-vegas/34-55734/\">Las Vegas</a> by the Fantastic Four to investigate a Hydra <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gamma-bomb/18-55673/\">Gamma Bomb</a>. However, things went horribly wrong and the bomb detonated in his face so Human Torch and the Thing are sent to bring back the Hulk before more people get hurt. But Bruce doesn't seem to be in control any more, as the Hulk now appears as a bald Grey Hulk. As Ben and Johnny fight this mindless Hulk, he seems to be recalling some of the tragic events in his life. Ben realizes that some-thing's wrong with him and that the explosion somehow messed up his mind. Ben told Johnny that he and the Hulk were both hit by something that made them monsters people need but don't want and that \"monsters understand monsters\". He attempts to reason with the Hulk despite Torch's protests. However, this doesn't work and Hulk recalls Betty's death and hallucinates that Thing is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abomination/29-3489/\">Abomination</a> (who killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/betty-ross/29-3445/\">Betty</a>) and savagely attacks the Thing who doesn't fight back. Hulk hits Thing so hard, Ben is immobilized and tastes blood and before Hulk could finish Thing off, Human Torch goes nova but it didn't seem to have any effect on him until the Hulk told them not to worry about him and that he's fine.</p><p>The fight in Las Vegas caused a lot of destruction so, the Illuminati were debating on whether or not Hulk should remain on Earth. Reed, Iron Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, and Doctor Strange were all for sending Hulk into outer space, so he wouldn't harm anyone ever again. However, their plan didn't work out as they planned, as the Hulk, now stronger than ever, returned to Earth and declared war on the Illuminati, including Reed. When the Hulk came for Reed, with the help of Susan and the New Fantastic Four, he projected a hologram of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> in order to calm the Hulk down, but his plan backfired and the Hulk defeated the Fantastic Four and captured him. The Hulk had built a gladiatorial arena in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a> and equipped Reed and Tony with obedience disks, forcing them to fight each other to the death. Reed defeated Tony but Hulk spared because he came for justice, not murder. During the final battle between Sentry and the Hulk, Stark used a satellite cannon to finally defeat the Hulk.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illuminati/65-40421/\">Illuminati</a> investigated the corpse of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a> who turned out to be a Skrull when Black Bolt revealed himself to be a Skrull himself and attacked the other members only to be killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>. The Illuminati then separated since anyone of them could be a Skrull. Reed and Hank Pym were examining the body of the Skrull in order to find out why the Skrulls are undetectable. When Reed discovered why, Hank revealed himself to be a Skrull and shot Reed with a special gun, destabilizing him.</p><p>He was taken to a Skrull armada in orbit where he was tortured by the Skrulls until being save by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sword/65-41666/\">SWORD</a> agent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abigail-brand/29-4441/\">Abigail Brand</a>. Using the information he discovered in the lab, Reed was able to develop a weapon that undoes the Skrulls shape-shifting abilities. Brand and Richards both traveled to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a> where they used this weapon to identify the Skrulls during their battle with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2220918\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" title=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\"><img id=\"2220918\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1</div></div></div></div><p>Susan was on a speaking tour around the world when she was attacked in her hotel room by Skrull Reed who used a forcefield to knock her out and neutralize her. That same Skrull took the form of Susan in order to infiltrate the Baxter Building while Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria were there, and opened a portal to the Negative Zone causing half the building along with everyone in it, the Skrull Susan, Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria, to be sucked in. While in the Negative Zone, they were attacked by Bug-like monsters. While Ben protected the kids from the \"bugs\", Johnny and Sue made it back to Reed's lab where they debated on who she really was. He asked her what her favorite movie was to which she answered wrong. The Skrull revealed herself to be Lyja, Johnny's ex. They fight and Lyja is captured by a Negative Zone monster but Torch saves her and they kiss for old times' sake. Franklin and Valeria make their way back to the lab to get a machine their dad built for them for defensive purposes and they help Thing fight off the rest of the bugs. Franklin suggests that they should free the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tinkerer/29-3144/\">Tinkerer</a> from his N-Zone prison in order to help them fix the Baxter Building. While on their way to the prison on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantasti-car-mk-i/18-42331/\">Fantasticar</a>, Valeria falls off, only to be saved by Lyja, who reveals that she was sent to kill them all but because of her feelings for Johnny she sent them to the N-Zone instead. The Thing frees the Tinkerer, and after an agreement, he manages to return the building to normal. As they make their way back to a ruined New York, Lyja decides to stay behind.</p><p>Sue was revealed to be held captive on another Skrull ship along with other heroes and villains, who were freed and returned back to Earth when Iron Man destroyed the Skrull ship. After returning to Earth, she reunited with Reed and they both checked on their family before joining the final battle along side their fellow heroes against the Skrulls.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>When the Fantastic Four were attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammer/65-56065/\">HAMMER</a> agents, Reed built a device called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-bridge/18-56497/\">Bridge</a> which allowed him in the story to explore alternate dimensions. The team was sent to other continuities, leaving Franklin and Valeria under siege from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a>, HAMMER agents and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a>. Valeria was able to outsmart them and separate Osborn from his agents and led in a room where he was confronted by Franklin wearing a Spider-Man mask, calling him a villain. While Osborn is chasing the children holding a gun, the Fantastic Four make their way back to the Baxter Building where an enraged Invisible Woman scream at Osborn to stay away from her children. However, the insane Osborn challenges her to make him, which she does by knocking him down with a forcefield and preventing his remaining forces from reaching him. Reed tells Osborn to leave and never return but he replies by attempting to shoot Reed, only to be shot by Franklin. However, Franklin was holding a harmless toy gun, having Ben and Johnny thinking that Franklin's powers may have returned. Sue then told Reed to destroy the Bridge which he did but secretly he put it back together.</p><h3>Prime Elements; the end of a Family</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2221100\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" title=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\"><img id=\"2221100\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party</div></div></div></div><p>On Franklin's birthday, an older Franklin infiltrated the Baxter Building and used a forcefield to prevent the team from reaching him. He then confronted Franklin and seemingly knock him down, angering the team. He then entered Valeria's room and informed her about the coming conflict between four cities and that the only hope is Doom. He urged her not to tell anyone of this encounter before she recognized him as her brother. When Reed was finally able to penetrate the forcefield, Future Franklin teleported away. In his bedroom, little Franklin formed a pocket Universe, hinting that his ultimate powers may have fully resurfaced. Deep within the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/antarctica/34-55940/\">Antarctic</a> underground Lake Vostok, the team made contact with the Lost Tribes of Atlantis who appointed Sue as their representative with the Outside world. Also the Universal Inhumans on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-moon/34-42072/\">the Moon</a>, the underground city of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a> have appeared.</p><p>Johnny met a beautiful woman at a night club and she came home with him.

It was revealed that all the other members of the old Fantastic Four team will be joining the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/future-foundation/65-57552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Future Foundation</a> team, including new member Spider-Man.</p><h2><b>New Fantastic Four</b></h2><p>A team of Marvel Superheroes who briefly became a replacement Fantastic Four in the early 1990's.</p><h2>Fantastic Four Suits</h2><p>Reed had invented specialized suits made of unstable molecules which could adapt to him and his teammates' powers. For him, his suit allows him to stretch to great lengths without tearing it. The costume also makes them harmless against electrical attacks. They are also computers. In them, they have something equivalent to a computer. It forms a network, keeping the team up to date. It also displays data for them and touchpad controls are available on their gauntlets. The costume is like a GPS, providing their location. It has a scanner which can scan things in their environment, being able to scan things like how many people are in the room next to them.</p><h3>Members</h3><ul><li>Spider-Man- once tried to \"apply\" to the team but reconsidered when he wasn't gonna get paid.</li><li>Hulk -in the Grey Hulk and the Professor personality in different occasions.</li><li>Wolverine</li><li>Ghost Rider -Danny Ketch version.</li></ul><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192173\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192173-nffvff_super.jpg\" title=\"The Fantastic Four V.S The New Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1192173\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192173-nffvff_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Fantastic Four V.S The New Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Fantastic Four V.S The New Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>When a female Skrull captured the original team, she impersonated the Invisible Woman to recruit a new team to avenge the \"death\" of the original and to steal a weapon from the Mole Man.</p><p>The team reassembled again by Doctor Strange to arrest the Human Torch for his actions that destroyed a quarter of a city.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486710\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four_super.jpg\" title=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\"><img id=\"486710\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610</div></div></div></div><p><b>Earth-1610</b></p><p>The Fantastic Four of the Ultimate universe is composed younger versions of the original four, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>. The origin of these four is different than the original. Reed Richards enters a Think Tank in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baxter-building/34-41454/\">Baxter Building</a> along with Sue Storm her father Richard Storm, one of the caretakers, Johnny Storm her brother and Victor Van Dame. He started in the think tank trying to create a teleportation device and joined work with Victor to get better results. When they had finally acquired results that seemed promising they tried it out. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Ben Grim</a> a childhood friend of Reed went to see the launch.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486712\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486712-ultimate_fantastic_four_001_super.jpg\" title=\"The Ultimate Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"486712\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486712-ultimate_fantastic_four_001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Ultimate Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Ultimate Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>The five of them were side by side trying to teleport an apple but got teleported instead. The teleportation consisted of going through something called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">Negative Zone</a> and the moment the five entered the N-Zone (a reality where the teleportation takes place as a mediator) affecting their DNA giving them superpowers. Reed could stretch to different lengths and didn't need to eat,drink or breathe. Sue could generate invisible force fields and arrange light making her invisible. Johnny could generate fire and fly. Ben turned into a rock brute with super strength. When Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny came together once again faced an old Baxter teacher now going as the Mole Man. The four face his mole men and won.</p><p>Later they decided to find <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Victor</a>. They found him in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a> where he was manipulating the locals with dragon tattoos. He now had metal instead of skin. He went against the four but he could not be arrested in Latveria.

While on the N-Zone, N-ihil pretended to be the Four's friend and explained how realities are stacked on the universe. That's when they became enemies. They returned home along with some sort of dinosaur leaving Annihilus in the N-Zone. Then they faced an old think tank jealous Brainiac going by the name The Thinker. She took over the Baxter Building and started going up against Reed. Brain against brain. The better genius won and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mad-thinker/29-2131/\">Thinker</a>, Rhona Burchill, escaped. Johnny went to school with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a> (AKA Spider-man). Johnny fell for a girl named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/liz-allen/29-15408/\">Liz Allen</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">MJ</a>, Peter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kong/29-12490/\">Kong</a>, Liz and Johnny went to the beach together. There he was seen using his powers. Liz being mutant-phobic stopped talking to him so Peter as Spidey went and cheered him up. Reed made contact with himself and the rest of the FF from another universe making them become the Ultimate Frightful Four.</p><p>Reed trying to cure Ben decided to change time. As a result <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> went to earth and gave them pills to give them superpowers. In the end they were betrayed by them all and they all died for the exception for Ben Grimm who didn't take the pill. He fought the Super-Skrull that used a suit to copy their powers. With no powers to be able to copy Ben took over and went back in time to stop the stopping of the accident. Again they faced the Frightful Four zombies and Doom went down along with them trying to be a hero. Spider-Man had a clone crisis and went to the FF for help. One of the clones who thought was Peter's father asked Sue to be his friend before dying. Reed cured <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">MJ</a> from a monster transformation she was having because of the clones. Then they gave the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scorpion/29-4484/\">Scorpion</a> clone to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Ga Lak Tus</a> was going to destroy the world and the FF did their part in stopping him. Teaming up with Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimates/65-40504/\">Ultimates</a> they got information from the Kree.</p><p>Reed created a machine that would damage Ga Lak Tus with the help of the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>. The Fantastic Four then went up against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gallowglass/29-51527/\">Gallowglass</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a>. They also faced their father <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> and got out of the problem with the help of Seed. The Thinker came back stealing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro's</a> hard drive and making the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> believe that it was the FF's fault. In the end they teamed up to defeat her. Then they faced Diablo a guy who created a teleportation from past to present and relied on magic.</p><p>After the Fantastic Four first encountered Thanos in his home dimension, Thanos implanted the idea for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a> in Reed Richard's mind. Legend told that Thanos had discovered the original Cosmic Cube after it feel from the sky above his planet. With it he would attempt to control all existence. Thanos' defeat was narrow, and the costs were great. While Reed believed that he was creating the cosmic cube out of his own accord, Thanos was controlling Reed in order to re-create the powerful weapon that he once lost. As Reed continued to analyze the possibilities contained within the energy lattice, he found the draw of creating a cube irresistible. Reed's first attempt to harness the energy required for fueling the cube would result in the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the real Silver Surfer as well as the inter-dimensional being that they would com to know as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psycho-man/29-7112/\">Psycho-Man</a>.</p><p>Sue then had to face <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-ghost/29-2473/\">Red Ghost</a>. After the Red Ghost's defeat Reed would continue to work on developing the Cube. She went by herself to what she thought was a conference but was caught with the woman who became the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-ghost/29-2473/\">Red Ghost</a>. With the help of the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson-dynamo/29-7234/\">Crimson Dynamo</a> the rest of the FF saved Sue. Because of the actions of Reed while building the cube their relationship was broken off. When he finished the cube it automatically protected <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a> from an attack from Seed. Thanos' forces would spring foreword, removing a block of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a> containing the Four to take back to his home dimension. Thanos battled Reed in order to take the cube by force. While the Cube was a powerful weapon, Reed's inexperience wielding it made him susceptible to Thanos' power, and Reed was seemingly destroyed before Thanos acquired the cube. Using the power of the cube, Thanos came into our reality and took over the minds and wills of Earth's superheroes including the Ultimates, the X-Men, the remaining members of the Fantastic Four, and all solo heroes. These heroes in turn helped Thanos capture any remaining rebels. Thanos was disturbed because he could tell that he somehow didn't have full access to the Cube's vast powers as he once did.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"504374\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51_super.jpg\" title=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\"><img id=\"504374\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51_medium.jpg\" alt=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">War over the Cosmic Cube</div></div></div></div><p>Meanwhile, Ben Grimm had located Thanos' estranged daughter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atrea/29-53792/\">Atrea</a> who helped him realize that Reed was not actually dead. During his battle with Thanos Reed used the power of the Cosmic Cube to create a charred likeness of himself, while turning his actual form into an energy being. This move allowed him to escape Thanos' full power by being perceived as dead. Atrea felt Reed was still alive but trapped, and freed his essence.</p><p>Convincing Atrea to rebel against her father, the three traveled back to their home dimension to battle Thanos. In the middle of the warped landscape of New York they found his citadel. With Atrea and Ben acting as a diversion Reed was able to get to Thanos to battle for control of the Cosmic Cube. While in partial control of the Cosmic Cube, Reed knew he was no match for Thanos' power.</p><p>The small portion of the Cube's power which Thanos previously was denied access to was Reed's work. Reed unlocked this sequestered power within the Cube, giving Thanos full access to the Cube's infinite resources. With full access to the Cosmic Cube restored, Thanos' physical form quickly deteriorated as he died. Thanos' infatuation with death had created a subconscious drive within himself, and it was that desire for the fullness of death that destroyed Thanos.</p><p>This left Reed the question of what to do with the Cube. It's vast powers had proven to dangerous for anyone, even himself, to wield. In order to deal with the Cube Reed opened up a very small rift in space and time and dropped the cube through. The cube plummeted through the rift and landed on Thanos' home planet many years earlier. The cube found its way to the sand in front of Thanos' very feet. The resulting paradox was that the original Cosmic Cube, the cube that Thanos had tricked Reed into building for him, was actually the Cosmic Cube that Reed had designed and built.</p><p>After the Cosmic Cube event Sue went up with a new mystery. An giant egg was found along with the ex-Think Tank people now living underground. The the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/salems-seven/65-41219/\">Salem's Seven</a> appeared into the picture trying to stop a flaming building and getting all the glory.</p><p><strong>March on Ultimatum</strong></p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of Captain America, Wolverine, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Shadowcat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimatum/39-55745/\">Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards.</p><p>The then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a> from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverines and Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott</a>. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over a s Captain America after Steve Rogers aged 100 years, then he died. In the future <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be Johnny he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, Namor and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops\u00b4s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. Ben and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/29-10964/\">Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue\u00b4s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother\u00b4s death. Everyone let the future hero\u00b4s free from a prison in the N-Zone Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that future would not happen.</p><h3>Ultimatum</h3><p>It's Tuesday 4:12 PM. Reed Richards is about to propose to Sue. Ben Grim is working out with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/herbie/29-23720/\">H.E.R.B.I.E</a> watching over. Johnny Storm and his father are having a heated argument on Johnny's intelligence.</p><p>It's Tuesday 4:13 PM. New York is underwater.</p><p>At the Baxter Building, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl reach the roof top. A whale enters the room with the Thing, Johnny and Franklin Storm are underwater. At their rooftop of the Baxter, Sue uses all her power to keep the water away from New York and then she collapses. The Thing arrives and Reed leaves Sue with him.</p><p>At 4:21 PM, Reed is already on an FF submarine and meets with Namor. Reed accuses him of the event while Namor excuses himself saying it was not him.</p><p>It's 12:31 AM in Latveria and all except Dr. Doom are frozen solid.</p><p>Then, telepathically Xavier tells all superheroes, that he knows who is responsible for this events, and that all of them have to unite against this threat, to stop <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>.</p><p>Back in the Baxter, Ben takes over and is now alone. The Baxter Building is turning invisible and Sue isn't stable. No scientist knows how to help her, and the one scientist who might have a chance of saving her is dead, Franklin Storm is dead.</p><p>The Thing has gone out of resources and Sue\u00b4s mother then arrives. She suggest that the person who could help would be Dr. Molveick a.k.a. The Mole Man. With the help of the students from Baxter B help Ben find Mole Man and save him from fire mole men. As a result he helps the Thing figures out that the way to help Sue is to internally help her. Using <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pym-particles/12-42077/\">Pym particles</a> the Thing and the Mole man are going to go inside the Invisible Girl.</p><p>The Thing and the Mole Man Successfully rescue Sue from herself by going inside. Inside they fix the problem and then after that Sue recovers completely. During the journey inside Sue Ben and Dr. Molevick found some strange antibodies that attacked them. Sue explained that these weren't antibodies, they were actually some form of robotic organisms implanted inside her by Reed without any of the Fantastic Four's knowledge. Because of this Sue realized that with he GPS system imbedded in them she could locate Johnny. So she gets to work.</p><p>Sue realizes that they need a huge antenna to locate Reed and Johnny around the world, so Sue's mother explains how advanced Atlantean technology could become useful here. Sue, Dr. Molevick, Mrs. Richards and Ben head into deep waters to get this technology. On their dive they discover some other Atlantean fugitives that were locked up. After being captured, since they couldn't surpass the power of these people, Sue's mother makes a deal that gets them out of the mess. They leave from Atlantis and create the necessary equipment to locate the nanobots implanted in Johnny and Reed. A mapping system appears showing the location of the rest of the team but it shows they aren't necessarily on earth. On a different earth Reed is with Dr. Doom and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-princess/29-6912/\">Princess Zarda</a> while Johnny is in a dimension where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a>, a demon lord, rules.</p><p>Hulk and Spider-Man see Doctor Strange's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sanctum-sanctorum/34-55966/\">Sanctum Sanctorum</a> blowing up. Magical beings start bursting out of control and Hulk and Spidey try and stop it. Dormammu, powered by the Human Torch, appears and kills everything in his path, apparently including Spider-Man.</p><p>Doctor Strange tries fighting off this monster but fails and get's killed in the process.</p><p>Now that Sue and Ben have located Johnny they go in to get him back. The Invisible Woman uses a forcefield over Dormammu's head cutting the oxygen from the monster and Johnny gives it all it's got to cut his breathing off. The effect brings him to turn back into a little man re-unites the Storms and 3/4 of the FF.</p><p>Reed finally comes back with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> and he along Doctor Doom and Princess Zardra take the fight to Magneto. The X-Men take the battle to Magneto and what's left of his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">brotherhood</a>. Nick Fury, with the help of Jean, shows Magneto how mutants are just a man-made accident. After this Cyclops kills Magneto.</p><h3>Post-Ultimatum</h3><p>After the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimatum/39-55745/\">Ultimatum</a>, Sue and Reed break up and the Fantastic Four are officially disbanded. Reed goes back to his parent's house, Sue takes over the Baxter Building for herself, burying herself in work, Ben joins the military and Johnny starts to travel.</p><p>After some time Johnny got tired of traveling around so instead of going to the Baxter he arrived on Peter Parker's doorstep. After talking to his sister he decides to live with the Parkers, Iceman and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\">Gwen Stacy</a> all while going to high school.</p><h3>Ultimate Enemy</h3><p>Reed Richards, now ex-leader of the world famous Fantastic Four, now lives with his parents and his father is not happy about that especially since he has no job to contribute to the family. After being brutally woken up by his father, Reed's computer detects an energy flux, and then somebody knocks at the door, even though Reed warns his father not to open the door, he opens it, and a purple, cloud-like explosion happens inside the Richard's home.</p><p>Sue uses her invisible powers to hide herself from the rest of the world while taking a walk in the city. She feels better when not having to be a world spectacle to the rest of the world. Once back in the Baxter she wonders all alone the place only to find Ben Grim interrupts her loneliness. After a brief catching up between the two, Sue examines Ben's recent shedding of rocks and Ben drops a bomb on her by telling her that he loves her. Now that her relationship with Reed is over he took the opportunity to tell her that. One of the Thing's rocks falls and leaves Sue by saying: \"something to remember me by\". Then a huge, purple, cloud/octopus-like creatures overtakes the Baxter building and Ben even when trying to stop it he is thrown to a street.</p><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486717\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30_super.jpg\" title=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\"><img id=\"486717\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Zombie Four of Earth-2149</div></div></div></div><p>*In the Zombie Universe the Fantastic Four as most other heroes are transformed into zombies.

Namor fell for Sue, but she fought him off. Reed using a new machine recreated superheroes to fight him but that didn't work either.

It was simply made so that the property could be copyrighted, though the directors (Roger Corman/Bernd Eichinger) and creators were left unaware of this fact, and so it was not intended to be released. The film depicted the origin of the Fantastic Four and their first battles with Dr. Doom and Mole Man.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486675\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie_super.jpg\" title=\"The Fantastic Four (1994)\"><img id=\"486675\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Fantastic Four (1994)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Fantastic Four (1994)</div></div></div></div><p>In 1994, a film about the Fantastic Four was produced in order that the studio, Constantin Film, could secure the rights to the group. Unknown to the director, crew and actors of the film, this movie was never intended to be released. The film starts with Reed and Victor Von Doom in college. An experiment goes goes wrong and Victor is allegedly killed. Reed's friend introduces him to her children Sue (a teenager) and Johnny (a preteen). Reed grieves for his friend but finishes school and years starts a space expedition (one that is to be piloted by his roommate Ben Grim) and they decide to bring, a now older, Sue and Johnny along (for shits and giggles).</p><p>Little do they know that Victor Von Doom did not die the day of that horrible experiment, and to that day had been planning his revenge on the man he assumes is responsible for his experiment not working (none other than Reed Richards of course). He sabotages their ship so it flies right on course with some cosmic rays (an energy source that has unknown strength) the ship seems to be destroyed in space. Doom laughs a terrible laugh and marvels in his years of planning coming to fruition.</p><p>The group survives the cosmic ray exposure and they crash land back on earth even though their ship blew up and it shouldn't be possible. Once they find they are all alive, they also discover they all have amazing powers. Reed Richards is elastic, Sue can hide from sight, Johnny is the Human Torch, and Ben has become the Thing, with a large gravel-like exoskeleton and super strength.</p><p>All you need to know is that Doom finds out the Fantastic Four are still alive and lures them to his lair. They fight. Doom's device almost goes off. They stop it and save the day. The End.</p><p>CAST:</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Hyde-White\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Hyde-White</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Fantastic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Staab\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rebecca Staab</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Woman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sue Storm / The Invisible Woman</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bailey_Smith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Bailey Smith</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Grimm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben Grimm (but not the Thing... strange choice if you ask me)</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Ciarfalio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carl Ciarfalio</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_%28comics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Thing (but not Ben Grimm... strange choice if you ask me)</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Underwood\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jay Underwood</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Torch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Storm / The Human Torch</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Culp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joseph Culp</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom\" rel=\"nofollow\">Victor Von Doom/ Doctor Doom</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kat_Green&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kat Green</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Masters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alicia Masters</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ian_Trigger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ian Trigger</a></td><td>The Jeweler</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><b>Fantastic Four</b></h4><p>Released in the US on July 8, 2005 it was the third superhero film of the year ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/223-126/\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-begins/223-12/\">Batman Begins</a> being the first and second respectively). The film was directed by Tim Story and released by 20th Century Fox, and though it was the first Fantastic Four film to be released it was the second to be filmed. This film told of the forming of the Fantastic Four and how they got their abilities. It was also a tale of their change in mindset when they slowly began to accept that it was their duty to be heroes, they were not destined to be normal, even Ben came to terms with this. The film also depicted the origins of the team's nemesis Dr. Doom and showed the characters developing their powers, pushing them to their limits and learning how they work. In the end, when working as a team they find themselves able to defeat Dr. Doom, his \"dead\" body is then shipped off to Latveria.</p><p>Among the deleted scenes included on the December 2005 DVD release:</p><ul><li>Three slightly modified scenes concerning the attack on Doctor Doom - one in which Reed uses his body as a funnel to direct a stream of water at Doom, one in which he doesn't, and one in which Doctor Doom's line \"Is that the best you can do, a little heat?\" is cut short, having the \"..a little heat?\" portion removed.</li></ul><ul><li>Two versions of a scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. The original features the pair in the planetarium, where they communicate their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. This ends in a kiss. The second version, included in the DVD release as a bonus feature, features the two outside, looking toward the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Statue_Of_Liberty\">Statue Of Liberty</a>. Similar lines are used, but it ends with Alba's Susan turning invisible before Gruffudd's Reed can kiss her. A joke was used during the line \"a stronger man\": Instead of Reed giving himself a square jaw (as he does in the theatrical release), he makes his skin look like the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/X-Men\">X-Men's</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Wolverine_%28comics%29\">Wolverine</a>. Actor Gruffudd breaks the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Fourth_wall\">fourth wall</a> and looks directly at the camera as he does this.</li></ul><ul><li>There is also a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building where we see on one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be H.E.R.B.I.E. from the 1970s Fantastic Four cartoon.</li></ul><p>The novelization of the film contained a number of scenes not in the final cut, including a small number of scenes that developed the character of Alicia Masters.</p><h4>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</h4><p>A sequel to the Fantastic Four film of 2005, this film was also directed by Tim Story. Rated PG-13, this film was released in North America on June 15, 2007 and some of its stars include:</p><ul><li>Ioan Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic)</li><li>Jessica Alba (Invisible Woman)</li><li>Chris Evans (Human Torch)</li><li>Michael Chiklis (Thing)</li><li>Julian McMahon (Doctor Doom)</li><li>Kerry Washington (Alicia Masters)</li><li>Beau Garrett ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frankie-raye/29-11605/\">Frankie Raye</a>)</li><li>Doug Jones (Silver Surfer)</li><li>Laurence Fishburne (Surfer's Voice)</li></ul><p>Stan Lee (Stan Lee) This film starts off quite some time after the last movie ended and focuses on the upcoming marriage between Sue and Reed and their relationship/future as well as the threat the Silver Surfer poses to the world. Once again the team finds themselves needing to work together as the Earth will be devoured if they do not, forcing them to do things like working with the resurrected Doom. Eventually they try and capture the Surfer but when they succeed they realize it was the wrong thing to do and Sue frees the alien, after creating a bond with him. She learns a lot about him and eventually it is this relationship that causes him to help the Fantastic Four by driving away Galactus, turning against his master.</p><h3>Satire</h3><p>In the animated show \"The Venture Brothers\", there is super powered family know as the \"The Impossibles\". They are direct parody of the Fantastic Four.</p><ul><li>Richard \"Mr. Impossible\" Impossible- can stretch and is negligent and abusive to his family.</li><li>Sally \"The Visible Woman\" Impossible- has to concentrate to not turn her skin invisible (but her muscle tissue is still visible).</li><li>Rocket Impossible- Their son.

Hearing\nof Hulk\u2019s rampage <a href=\"/rick-jones/29-2248/\">Rick Jones</a> and <a href=\"/teen-brigade/65-55757/\">The Teen Brigade</a> send a radio message to <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">The\nFantastic Four</a> to help stop the Hulk but <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> diverts the message to Thor, whom\nhe hopes will battle The Hulk. Unknown to Loki, the message was also picked\nup by <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Ant-Man</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">The Wasp</a>. These heroes came together to stop the\nmenace of The Hulk but they soon discovered Loki\u2019s trickery and teamed up with\nHulk to defeat the God of Mischief. Ant-Man stated that the five work well\ntogether and suggested they combined to form a team against threats that no lone hero can deal with. The Wasp proposes the name \u201cAvengers\u201d and thus <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth\u2019s</a> Mightiest Heroes were formed. The original members are known as the\n\"founding members\" based on an Avengers Charter, to manage the good\nname of the team. As a result, their wishes regarding the direction of the team\nare given additional weight and deference.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Avengers were created by legendary comic creators <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> and\nmade their first appearance in <a href=\"/the-avengers/49-2128/\">The Avengers</a> #1 (Sep. 1963) in the story \u201cThe\nComing of the Avengers\u201d.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Founding Members</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Ant-Man</a></li><li>For constant change of roster see <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/old-order-changeth/12-56031/\">Old Order Changeth</a></li></ul><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2435149\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2435149-avengers_1.jpg\" title=\"The Avengers #1 (1963)\"><img id=\"2435149\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2435149-avengers_1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Avengers #1 (1963)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Avengers #1 (1963)</div></div></div></div><p>The founding members of Avengers. apart from Hulk, were already recognised\nand established superheroes before the team formed. The Hulk at this time greatly divided public\nopinion. Some thought he was a misunderstood creature who just wanted to be\nleft alone. However thanks to the efforts of <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\">General \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross</a>, the\nmajority of people viewed The Hulk as a rampaging menace. Almost from inception the Avengers team roster has been\nfluid, with the Hulk departing during their second adventure and <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain\nAmerica</a> joining soon after. The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the\nteam although one theme has been constant - The Avengers fight the foes that no\nsingle superhero could defeat - hence their famous cry of \"Avengers\nAssemble!\"</p><p>The Avengers have always accepted a diverse range of\nmembers, regardless of their backgrounds, as long as they are ready to fight\nthe good fight. To that end, the team has featured humans, <a href=\"/robots/12-56059/\">robots</a>, <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">mutants</a>, Gods,\n<a href=\"/aliens/12-46567/\">aliens</a>, supernatural beings and even former villains, such as <a href=\"/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a> and <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black\nWidow</a>. Despite the diverse nature of the team, which often results in\nsquabbling, the Avengers have always managed to unite into a cohesive unit to\ncombat the deadliest threats in the universe.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2435148\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2435148-avengers_1_2.jpg\" title=\"The other Avengers distrust The Hulk\"><img id=\"2435148\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2435148-avengers_1_2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The other Avengers distrust The Hulk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The other Avengers distrust The Hulk</div></div></div></div><p>During their first team meeting there is already inner\nsquabbling between the Avengers as Thor and Hulk exchange words.

The Space Phantom switches bodies with\neach Avenger and plants seeds of distrust and hatred amongst them. It is clear\nthat the other Avengers never truly trusted the Hulk and in fact admit to each\nother they had him join their ranks to keep an eye on him. The Space Phantom\nmanages to have the Hulk realize this distrust in the others and he leaves the\nteam.</p><p>Soon afterwards The Hulk is befriended by <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> the Sub-Mariner\nand the two <a href=\"/antiheroes/12-55830/\">antiheroes</a> form an uneasy alliance to battle their common foe -\nhumans. The Avengers, who were searching for the Hulk to prevent him from\nharming others, are tipped by the Teen Brigade of his location. A confrontation\ntakes place between the Avengers, Namor and Hulk. But in the middle of the\nbattle Hulk changes to Bruce Banner and leaves Namor to fight the Avengers\nalone.

The\nice thaws as it heads towards warmer waters and the body inside is eventually discovered by The\nAvengers who are in a submarine searching for Namor. The heroes bring the floating body on board and realise it is Captain America, who has been in suspended animation since the Second\nWorld War. Thus the Living Legend of World War II is reborn! Initially\nCap attacks The Avengers mistaking them as threats but the issue is quickly\nsettled and The Avengers take Captain America back to <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a> where he helps\nthem defeat Namor and the alien <a href=\"/starhammer/29-50246/\">Vuk</a>.

After a brief battle, the Vision stops and tells the Avengers that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron-5</a> had sent him to attack the Avengers.</p><p>So the Avengers accompany the Vision and go to Ultron\u2019s lair. It turns out to be a trap, and the Avengers are captured. Then the unexpected happens: the Vision fights Ultron and wins, thus saving the Avengers. The Vision is then tested in melee and questioned by a whole lot of Avengers. He eventually becomes a new member.</p><p>Under the pressure of being chairman and lacking self-confidence, Hank Pym goes to his lab in the Wasp\u2019s mansion, and has an accident. The mixture of different chemicals triggers a new persona, and Hank now calls himself Yellowjacket. This persona is more confident and free willed, a total opposite to his current personality. After thwarting and bashing some thugs, Hank enters the Avengers Mansion and wants to join their ranks. He makes claims that his Yellowjacket persona killed his Goliath persona. The Avengers didn\u2019t take the news likely, so Hank grabs the Wasp and escapes to his miniature base outside the mansion. Hank then kisses the Wasp, and from that point-on the Wasp knows it is actually Hank.</p><p>The two decide to get married, and tons of superheroes make their way to the wedding of Yellowjacket and the Wasp. To everyone\u2019s surprise the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/circus-of-crime/65-23035/\">Circus of Crime</a> decide to be wedding crashers. Hank sees the Wasp in danger, and stresses that Yellowjacket is unable to rescue and snaps out of it, and grows back to Goliath and saves his now wife the Wasp.</p><h3>Let the Game Begin</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grandmaster/29-32735/\">Grandmaster</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kang/29-2264/\">Kang</a> plays a game of chess for the life of Kang's dead love, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ravonna/29-7222/\">Ravonna</a>.

A group of heroes formed a team called, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a>.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"108526\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war_super.jpg\" title=\"Whose Side Are You On?\"><img id=\"108526\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Whose Side Are You On?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Whose Side Are You On?</div></div></div></div><p>Trying to get high ratings for their TV show, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">New Warriors</a> came in contact with a group of super-villains in Stamford, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/connecticut/34-56118/\">Connecticut</a>. This led to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a>, who was a part of the group of villains, to explode, killing the New Warriors and killing over six hundred people, including a group of school children. With the public now fearing that super-humans were becoming a threat, Congress passes the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human Registration Act</a>. Believing this to be unconstitutional, Captain America escapes Government capture and gathers others to fight with him against the SHRA. Iron Man, in contrast, believes the SHRA was the best way to keep the public safe and keep all superheroes accountable for their own actions and worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. to help capture Captain America. This divided the super-human community, which literally became a super-human <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, leading to multiple conflicts between Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. with Cap's \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a>,\" and left friendships and relationships broken, familirs divided, friends turned into bitter enemies, and the death of few individuals, such as Bill Foster, Goliath. The war only ended when Captain America finally surrendered after seeing the harm the war was doing, but this only ended in more bloodshed as Captain America was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america/39-54540/\">assassinated</a> shortly after surrendering.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, once learning of a secret Skrull invasion and now not being able to know who they can trust, the Avengers are even more divided. When a Skrull spaceship crash lands in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>, both the New and Mighty Avengers go to investigate, only to face off against Skrulls disguised as younger versions of different heroes. With the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, both teams unite and make make their way back to New York City, joining together with many of Earth's heroes and villains as they enter into battle in Central Park against the Skrull Empire, who are being led by the Skrull Queen <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/queen-veranke/29-54514/\">Veranke</a>, who had orchestrated the entire invasion. This battle led to the supposed death of the Wasp, the invasion was finally ended with the death of Queen Veranke at the hands of none other than Norman Osborn, who was later put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. by the President after the battle.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-reign/39-55707/\">Dark Reign</a>, for reasons unknown, both split factions of the Avengers (New and Mighty) remain separated in their fight against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a>. Both teams have major Avengers on their teams, but the most likely reason for the division is that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a> are still trying to live up to the Earth Mightiest Heroes moniker, while the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a> are more street level in their crime fighting.</p><h3>Siege</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1117828\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1117828-siege_202_4_super.jpg\" title=\"Steve Rogers gathering the troops\"><img id=\"1117828\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1117828-siege_202_4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Rogers gathering the troops\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Steve Rogers gathering the troops</div></div></div></div><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siege/39-55985/\">Siege</a>, bringing his Dark Reign to its climax, Norman Osborn has one last objective to complete: bringing down <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a>. Teaming up with the villain, Loki, Norman frames the Asgardian <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/volstagg/29-3513/\">Volstagg</a>, giving himself an excuse to attack. Norman then leads his \"Avengers\" on an all out assault on Asgard, and the first hero to fall in the battle is none other then Thor.</p><p>As the battle rages on, Ares learns of Norman's lies and decides to join his fellow god's into battling Osborn's forces. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maria-hill/29-40824/\">Maria Hill</a> then rescues Thor from Norman's men, and helps him escape back into town to heal. Back at the Avengers hideout in Brooklyn, the newly returned Steve Rogers, in uniform, rallies the New and Young Avengers along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-warriors/65-54569/\">Secret Warriors,</a> and they then head to Asgard. Back in Asgard, Ares has a change of heart and finds and attacks Norman, but is stopped by Sentry, who, after a short struggle rips Ares in half, killing him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daken/29-42501/\">Daken</a>, who was sent into Broxton to find Thor, locates him, but Thor hits him with a bolt of lightning and declares that he will not hide from Norman or his men, Osborn then sends Sentry in to finish Thor off. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/taskmaster/29-4578/\">Taskmaster</a> then warns Norman to turn around, and as he does, he sees Cap's shield flying straight for him.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1154316\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1154316-siege003_int_lr_0003_4_super.jpg\" title=\"Avengers Assemble!\"><img id=\"1154316\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1154316-siege003_int_lr_0003_4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers Assemble!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers Assemble!</div></div></div></div><p>Cap's shield then nails Norman on the head, knocking him back as Cap along with the New and Young Avengers and Fury and his Warriors come in behind him as Cap yells \"Avengers Assemble!\" The heroes join the Asgardians and begin to fight back Osborn's forces, Thor and Maria Hill are then confronted by Sentry and Thor engages in battle with him. Norman then calls on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">The Hood</a> and his gang to join the battle. In the town, Young Avenger Speed locates Tony Stark and gives him the briefcase that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a> gave Cap before they left. The President then orders H.A.M.M.E.R. to be taken down. Thor and Sentry continue to battle, while Iron Man joins the battle, using his own armor to shutdown Osborn's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Iron Patriot</a> armor, which causes Norman to order <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> to destroy Asgard. The Sentry causes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> to break apart and fall to Broxton. Norman's suit then falls apart, revealing his now Green Goblin deformed face to the Avengers and to the news team who are filming the whole thing, showing Osborn's true face to the world. Norman then tells the heroes that they don't know what they've done, that he's the only one who can control the Sentry, he then points up to the skies where the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/void/29-11585/\">Void</a> is now, Norman then tells them that they are all dead.</p><p>The Avengers do their best to fight off the Void, but they are quickly overpowered by him. Only with the help of Loki who begged Odin for the Norn Stones, did the Avengers gain the power of the stones. Now powered up, the Avengers took the fight straight to the Void, gaining the upper hand, but this new power-up was short lived as the Void seemly kills Loki, taking away the heroes new found power. Iron Man takes control of the H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier, turning it into a giant bullet, and ramming it into the Void. The heroes find Bob begging them to kill him, but he soon reverts back into the Void, only to be finally struck down by Thor, Thor then takes the Sentry's body and throws it into the sun.</p><h3>The Heroic Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1226501\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1226501-siege_204_11_super.jpg\" title=\"Enter The Heroic Age\"><img id=\"1226501\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1226501-siege_204_11_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Enter The Heroic Age\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Enter The Heroic Age</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-heroic-age/39-56023/\">The Heroic Age</a>, the President gives Steve Rogers Norman Osborn's job as America's Top Cop, Steve accepts, but tells the President that he's going to do things his way.

Thor soon arrives, telling them that if the call is sent out, he will join their ranks once more, hearing this, Steve tells Thor that's good news since he's going to need all of the Avengers for what he has planned next.</p><p>Following those events, Steve Rogers asks various heroes and former Avengers to join his new plan. Nearly all of them enthusiastically agree, save for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>, who believes all the recent misfortunes that happened on Marvel Earth to be the Avengers fault. Steve disagrees, but leaves an opening for Simon to join if he wishes. He later assembles the main team of Avengers: Bucky Barnes as Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a>, Hawkeye, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. Steve explains the reasons for which he decided that they should be the core group, the \u201cface of a new era\u201d. He wanted a team comprised of strength, nobility, bravery, responsibility and selflessness. Several members of the group get to know each other better, while Iron Man voices his concern on being teammates with Steve once again. Steve explains that the Avengers would not answer to him, but to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maria-hill/29-40824/\">Maria Hill</a> instead.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1233900\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1233900-kang_super.jpg\" title=\"Kang returns\"><img id=\"1233900\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1233900-kang_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kang returns\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kang returns</div></div></div></div><p>At that point, a time traveling <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kang/29-2264/\">Kang the Conqueror</a> emerged.

It is a device that Iron Man conceived, but never got to actually create: a doomsday machine. Forced to do as Kang says, in fear he will activate it, the Avengers hear him out: according to Kang, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron</a> would slay the Avengers at some point in the future, and rule with an iron fist, before the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/next-avengers/65-17900/\">Avengers\u2019 children</a> eventually stop his reign \u2013 only to start their own empire, and threaten the entire universe. Kang asks the Avengers to build a time machine and travel to the future in order to stop their successors. He pledges that he will no longer harm them, but rather befriend the Avengers if they will do so.</p><p>The Avengers debate on if they should intervene, or not, and they decide to do so.

A <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\"><b>Skrull</b></a> posing as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\"><b>Black Panther</b></a> easily found out information about the Avengers fighting against the Skrull army. Once the Avengers found out that a Skrull was impersonating their fellow teammate and friend, the Avengers took him down and freed the real Black Panther. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\"><b>Iron Man</b></a> created ID cards for the Avengers so that they can have access to the mansion instead of outsiders (people outside of the team) could just walk in. Throughout the years the ID cards have gotten more advanced and are currently used by mostly all of the branching Avenging teams (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\"><b>Secret Avengers</b></a> ). The ID Cards were also created for the days during the superhero fight for freedom called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\"><b>Civil War</b></a> - as a reminder for heroes to keep their cards at all cost or suffer being thrown into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\"><b>Negative Zone</b></a> .</p><p>Though the ID Cards have come in handy, mostly any super powered villain could steal one from an Avenger member and use a shape-shifter to pose as that hero. So Iron Man (teamed with other genius heroes) made a card that needs the Avengers retina scanned. The look and ideal of the ID Card has changed throughout the years, but it is one of the Avengers greatest tools at keeping their secrets safe.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"542913\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/542913-zombie_avngers_super.jpg\" title=\"Zombie Avengers of Earth-2149\"><img id=\"542913\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/542913-zombie_avngers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Zombie Avengers of Earth-2149\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zombie Avengers of Earth-2149</div></div></div></div><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><p>In this alternate reality, the Avengers are infected by a virus that turns everyone into a zombie who craves for flesh no matter what.

That was the motivation that spurred him to create his \"Master Mold\", a servitor/controller that would command the many 'Sentinels' that Trask would create later. Unfortunately the A.I. it had been given, began to grow exponentially and Master Mold became sentient, and made sure his progeny acquired this ability also. Ironically, unbeknown to Trask he had fathered two children who would grow up to become mutants: Tanya (and Lawrence) who had the ability of time travel and due to the instability of her power became lost in the timestream. When Bolivar discovered that Lawrence was 'Gifted' with Precognition, he went to great lengths to create a device that would disguise his son's genetic ability (from his guardians) and hid it within an amulet, that He gave Lawrence, after Bolivar realized his son had predicted his wife's death. Trask had created Humanity's guardian in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/master-mold/29-10254/\">Master Mold</a>, but had Not factored in Sentinel Logic in problem-solving, \"We were created to be the Guardians of Mankind - and to guard them properly we must RULE them completely\". Master Mold commanded the existing Sentinels to capture their creator and return with him, So that he could commence the creation of a vast army of Sentinels with the intention of World domination. Trask, after witnessing Beast's interrogation under the Psycho-probe realized that it was He, who had created the threat. To destroy Master Mold, he sacrificed himself by triggering an explosion. The X-Men barely escaped, Bolivar was found by his son, and who, from that day blamed Mutants (specifically the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> ) for his father's demise, and made it his project to vastly improve on his father's design, initially converting the Mk I's then eventually creating the superior Mark II Sentinels. They could identify/determine a Mutant's power from a distance due to an encyclopaedic database and Advanced scanning equipment and could conceive a plan to nullify/neutralize All mutant powers/attacks, and incapacitate any opponent. Judge Chalmers (a close family friend) abhorred by Lawrence's extreme solution, (and privy to the family secret) decided to shock his young ward by snatching the amulet about his neck (That, to that day had hidden his presence from his servitors) No longer masked by the amulet, his former servitors, apprehended Trask and followed his last order as their leader, \"<b>Secure</b> All Mutants in area - - and <b>DESTROY</b> them\", Needless to say the X-Men triumphed and saved the Day. In a future confrontation with his creations, Lawrence became involved, when Quicksilver used him, to locate his sister (the Scarlet Witch) who had been abducted by the Sentinels, in their latest scheme to rid the world of Mutants. Unfortunately, He too, came to an untimely end, crushed beneath one of his creations Like his Father.</p><p>Even though two generations of Sentinels had failed in their objective, the technology still lived on, the US government took possession of Trask's plans, wherein (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steven-lang/29-14861/\">Steven Lang</a> and later) <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">Sebastian Shaw</a> set out to build a new line of Sentinels.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Sentinels were created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.

Aged by a bubble that bent space and time, the Cuckoos joined the X-Men. It was eventually discovered that there were actually a thousand more clones of Emma Frost who had been created by the Weapon Plus program. They were collectively known as \"Weapon XIV\". These surplus clones were destroyed by the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a> while it possessed the body of Celeste.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Stepford Cuckoos were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ethan-van-sciver/26-9317/\">Ethan Van Sciver.</a> They first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-x-men/49-18078/\">New X-Men #118</a>. Originally Grant Morrison intended the first letter of each of the girls name to spell <strong>S-P-I-C-E,</strong> but as he never finished naming the girl, the last was named Mindee. This was later corrected by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-fraction/26-42266/\">Matt Fraction</a>, who attributed the name Irma to Mindee.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Riot at Xavier's</h3><p><b>For further details see:</b> <a href=\"/riot-at-xaviers/39-43639/\">Riot at Xavier's</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134067\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134067-192827-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Top Students\"><img id=\"134067\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134067-192827-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Top Students\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Top Students</div></div></div></div><p>During the student riot on opening day headed by Quentin Quire - a student, powerful telepath, and the Cuckoos' chief rival who had an unrequited love for Sophie - Emma offhandedly chastised the girls for hiding during the riot rather than assisting to end it, as she felt true heroes should. Inspired by Emma's words, Sophie used Kick to increase the Cuckoos' abilities and used Cerebra to stop Quentin. Although Quentin was defeated, the overexertion and her sister Esme's unknown telepathic suggestion resulted in Sophie's death.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134061\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134061-58664-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Open Day\"><img id=\"134061\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134061-58664-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Open Day\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Open Day</div></div></div></div><p>The remaining Cuckoos were later awarded for their bravery and outstanding use of telepathy in line with the ideals of the Institute. After Sophie's untimely death, they began calling themselves the Four-In-One. The Cuckoos blamed Emma Frost for Sophie's death, and separated themselves from her. This hurt her greatly. The Stepford Cuckoos then telepathically communicated with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> while at a gathering, not only to test the new limits on their reduced powers, but also to tell her about Emma's telepathic affair with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott.</a> Jean furiously confronted Emma and trampled through Emma's mind, humiliating her. Emma managed to barely hold out against this attack in her diamond form until Scott willingly showed Jean that nothing had happened. Emma was later discovered in her diamond form, shattered in pieces, having been shot by a diamond bullet while in her diamond body, which had one flaw. To help find the murderer, Sage and Bishop came to investigate. They found that Angel Salvador killed Emma, but was being mind-controlled by Esme, who was working for Xorn (Magneto). Deciding to flee, Esme told the other Cuckoos that she desired individuality and that Emma Frost did not care about them, but instead only wanted to make them like her. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was leaving. Esme telepathically defeated both of them and joined Xorn/Magneto.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"162230\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/162230-65947-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Sophie's death\"><img id=\"162230\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/162230-65947-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie's death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sophie's death</div></div></div></div><p>Xorn, believing himself to be Magneto, began destroying New York, planning to reverse the magnetic poles and leading a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with Esme as a member. Esme believed that Xorn/Magneto reciprocated her feelings of love, but he rejected her. During the chaos, the X-Men joined together to stop him, and Celeste, Phoebe and Mindee used their telepathy to safely guide civilians to safety.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"187930\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187930-186482-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Esme's death\"><img id=\"187930\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187930-186482-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Esme's death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Esme's death</div></div></div></div><p>Hurt by his rejection and concerned for Xorn/Magneto's sanity, Esme and the others turned against him. Esme used her telepathy to destroy Xorn's mind. This caused him to lash out and kill her by magnetically ripping out her earrings and forcing them into her brain. Esme died in Emma Frost's arms, with Emma saying, \"...you turned into such a wonderful little femme fatale in the end, didn't you? I\u2019m ever so proud of all my girls but you ... I think I\u2019m most especially proud of you, dear.\" Despite this, Esme's last words to Emma were \"...Nothing like you...\".</p><p>With Esme's death, the girls resolved their differences with Emma and called themselves the Three-in-One.</p><p>The three remaining Stepford Cuckoos were members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsairs/65-46826/\">Corsairs</a>, until they disbanded following M-Day. The Stepford Cuckoos were instrumental to defeating Blob, whose few vulnerabilities included telepathy. They were also seen going to the dance with Hellion. The three survived the depowering caused by Decimation, and remained as students at the school.</p><h3>The Phoenix Endsong</h3><p><b>For further details see:</b> <a href=\"/phoenix-endsong/39-51111/\">Phoenix Endsong</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"169131\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/169131-97989-kid-omega_super.jpg\" title=\"Kid Omega with Sophie's Body\"><img id=\"169131\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/169131-97989-kid-omega_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kid Omega with Sophie's Body\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kid Omega with Sophie's Body</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-omega/29-40583/\">Quentin Quire</a> awoke from his psionic stasis when the Phoenix manifested itself on Earth again and revived the recently deceased Jean Grey. Realizing that the Phoenix could revive Sophie, he unearthed her body and confronted the Phoenix, stating that he would give it whatever it wanted. The Phoenix Force revived Sophie, who took one look at Quentin as he professed his love to her, and responded, \"Eww.\" Sophie then reverted to a corpse again, preferring death to being with Quentin. The other Cuckoos assisted the X-Men as they fought the Phoenix Force by using Cerebra to contact all of the X-Men and collecting them to channel positive thoughts and love to Jean Grey. Jean Grey was then able to wrest control from the Phoenix Force and spiritually move onward to the White Hot Room, dying again. Quentin realized that Sophie would never love him and returned to a deep sleep. Meanwhile, a shard of the Phoenix communicated with one of the Cuckoos, who responded \"Oh, of course. What took you so long?\"</p><h3>Phoenix Warsong</h3><p><b>For further detail see:</b> <a href=\"/phoenix-warsong/39-51110/\">Phoenix Warsong</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"288678\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/288678-51142-celeste-cuckoo_super.jpg\" title=\"Celeste\"><img id=\"288678\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/288678-51142-celeste-cuckoo_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Celeste\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Celeste</div></div></div></div><p>In the follow-up series, X-Men: Phoenix Warsong, the Cuckoos origin was revealed, and the Cuckoos, having been contacted by the Phoenix, began manifesting new powers such as telekinesis and the ability to generate fire. The three Cuckoos each handled the Phoenix's influence differently. Celeste feared the power of the Phoenix, remembering how it drove Jean Grey insane, while Phoebe embraced its destructive powers. They went to different staff separately to try to work out their feelings and their growing identities, free of their sisters. However, before the X-Men could effectively intervene, the Phoenix took over and the Cuckoos returned to <a href=\"/the-world/34-41078/\">The World</a>, the headquarters of the Weapons Plus program. Meanwhile, Esme and Sophie mysteriously revived, albeit in decaying forms, and spoke of collecting information and realizing their true mission.</p><p>The X-Men followed the Cuckoos and learned that as creations of The World, the Cuckoos have implanted nano-technology that caused them to unknowingly transmit any and all information they encountered back to The World. Thus, Esme and Sophie did not actually return to life, but were rather piloted by their nano-technological systems. In addition, Emma learnt that the Cuckoos were truly her daughters, having been cloned from her eggs, which were harvested by <a href=\"/sublime/29-11330/\">Dr. Sublime</a> while she was in a coma following a Sentinel attack years before. Sublime cloned a thousand Cuckoos, in tanks hooked up to machinery. The original five were released to infiltrate the school and transmit information. Their origins were never questioned due to a strong telepathic block placed in everyone's minds which would cause their thoughts to redirect whenever they questioned where the Cuckoos came from.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134071\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Weapon XIV\"><img id=\"134071\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Weapon XIV\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Weapon XIV</div></div></div></div><p>Dr. Sublime intended the remaining Cuckoos to return and join their \"sisters\". The true purpose of the Thousand-In-One (called Weapon XIV) was to combine their minds into one immense psychic weapon and telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. By assimilating the original Cuckoos into the one, Sublime would be able to control the power of the Phoenix through his control of the Thousand-In-One. It was then revealed that every Cuckoo could also turn into a diamond form, but unlike Emma, their diamond forms were flawless. He could then use the Thousand to split the Phoenix between all of them and trap it within their diamond bodies, thus giving him further control. Mindee willingly chose to re-assimilate, but Phoebe attempted to fight her way out. The X-Men attempted to destroy Sublime. When the X-Men severed Sublime's control of the Thousand and deactivated all the Cuckoos' nano-technology (including the original three), each individual clone awoke with their own consciousness and reached out to their sisters and mother.</p><p>It was revealed that Celeste was chosen as the primary host for the Phoenix because it heard Celeste \"call\" to her, as Celeste longed to feel, to live, and to burn with life. Emma reached out to a fearful Celeste and told her that her methods of teaching - trying to make the girls cold and emotionless as a means of protecting them - was flawed and that she hoped the girls would live with passion. She then gave Celeste the confidence to do \"what was right\" with the Phoenix Force and for her sisters.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"249689\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Three-in-one\"><img id=\"249689\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Three-in-one\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Three-in-one</div></div></div></div><p>However, to Emma's horror, the Phoenix used Celeste to destroy every \"sister\" of the Weapon XIV and the revived Sophie and Esme in order to end their threat against mutant-kind. The only ones spared were Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe. During the aftermath, Celeste begged the Phoenix to leave her as what it had forced her to do was too much. The Phoenix decided it wanted to stay with Celeste, so to stop it, Celeste divided her into three, and each remaining Cuckoo turned her heart into flawless organic diamond. Doing so trapped the Phoenix within them so that it could no longer wreak havoc. Unfortunately, this also caused the Cuckoos to lose their emotions forever. Thus, the Cuckoos - especially Celeste, who longed to truly live, grow, and love - sacrificed their ability to ever do so for the sake of maintaining peace. In truth, the Phoenix they encountered was merely a shard of the true Phoenix, having been shattered into billions of pieces at the end of <i>X-Men: Phoenix Endsong</i>. Despite this, that shard remained divided in three and sealed within Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe.</p><p>These events devastated Emma, whose thousands of cloned daughters had each just begun to reach out for her with their minds when the Phoenix chose to destroy them. Emma then vowed that the Phoenix would have to contend with her if it ever returned, be it cosmic entity or in the form of Jean Grey.</p><h3>Quest for Magik</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b> <a href=\"/quest-for-magik/39-47186/\">Quest for Magik</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"303941\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"303941\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The Cuckoos helped Elixir to master biological manipulation by taking all biological and medical information from <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast's</a> head and duplicating it in <a href=\"/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir's</a> mind. Along with the other students, they were captured by <a href=\"/belasco/29-10947/\">Belasco</a> and sent to <a href=\"/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> as he searched for <a href=\"/illyana-rasputin/29-71216/\">Illyana Rasputin</a>.

In doing so, they learned that Belasco loved Illyana, but was only able to revive her soulless body, Darkchild, her soul lost and unreachable. After the defeat of Belasco by <a href=\"/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie</a> and Darkchild, the Cuckoos and the other students returned to the Institute, which reverted as if nothing had occurred.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><p><b>For further detail see:</b> <a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a></p><p>The Cuckoos helped the X-Men to find a <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">baby mutant</a>, the first post-Decimation mutant child born.

They remained loyal to Cyclops kept their own silence on the subject of X-Force.</p><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull's</a> invasion on Earth, the Cuckoos helped defend San Francisco from the Skrulls. When the Skrulls created a psychic blockade, it rendered every telepath useless and attempting to use their powers hurt them psychically. They soon channeled their powers to Emma Frost with the help of Cerebra, in the hopes that Frost would find and destroy the psychic blockade. Emma's psyche was temporarily disconnected from her body as she fought off the psychic Skrulls. The Cuckoos followed Cyclops' orders and used their telepathy to keep Emma's autonomic functions going, thereby animating her empty body. Emma finally destroyed the blockade, allowing the girls to use their telepathy again.</p><h3>Nation X</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b>: <a href=\"/nation-x/39-55961/\">Nation X</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1039279\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36512/1039279-cuckoos_517_super.png\" title=\"The Phoenix Fragments Leaving\"><img id=\"1039279\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36512/1039279-cuckoos_517_medium.png\" alt=\"The Phoenix Fragments Leaving\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Phoenix Fragments Leaving</div></div></div></div><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scalphunter/29-9734/\">Scalphunter</a> sent a group of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a> to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopia/34-56536/\">Utopia</a>, the X-Men were forced to battle the mutant-eating creatures. The Cuckoos served as a means of telepathic communication for the team, but during the battle, the Phoenix fragments that were contained inside their diamond hearts left them. It mysteriously returned to space, leaving the girls unconscious.</p><p>Once the Stepford Cuckoos woke up from their comma, they began scanning for the Phoenix. Since they couldn't find any trace of the psychic entity, they asked <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> to take some of their power so they could try passive scanning, as Mindee believed that since the Phoenix could bend active psychic probes the same way a black hole does with light. They explained to Rogue that she wouldn't just get the power, she'd get the perspective as well, the perspective of triangulating on peoples mind. When Rogue finished with the Cuckoos powers, they said that the silence of little or no telepathy could be deafening. They also told Scott that they didn't find anything on Cerebra. He then asked her if they had gotten a trace of the Phoenix when it left them, and they replied that it got further and further away without actually moving.</p><h2>Powers</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"747873\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3_super.jpg\" title=\"Psychic Gestalt\"><img id=\"747873\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Psychic Gestalt\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Psychic Gestalt</div></div></div></div><p>The Stepford Cuckoos are powerful telepaths, who can combine their telepathic abilities to create an even more powerful hive-mind. Their telepathic powers include broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, blasts of pure psionic energy, seeing through another person's eyes, and also are so powerful that they are one of the few people able to operate Cerebra. The Stepford Cuckoos are considered to be near Omega-level mutants, though they have never been classified as such, and since the deaths of their two sisters, have reduced in power.</p><p>In <i>X-Men: Phoenix Warsong</i>, they were the avatars of the Phoenix. During possession, they displayed new powers related to the Phoenix, such as Phoenix-granted telekinesis and fire generation. It is unlikely that they still possess these abilities, however, especially after their captured Phoenix fragments left them abruptly during the <i>Nation X</i> storyline. It should be noted that avatars of the Phoenix are normally only Omega-level mutants and that the Phoenix in question was merely a shard of the full Phoenix Force. Regardless of this, they are uniquely powerful telepaths and essential to the X-Men. Often, they maintain telepathic communication for the teams via Cerebra when Emma is occupied with other missions.</p><p>The Cuckoos have also inherited the ability to turn into organic diamond like their mother, Emma Frost. However, unlike Emma, their diamond forms are flawless, and cannot be shattered. Despite having this ability, the Cuckoos have never utilized it outside of the events of <i>Warsong</i>, where their hearts were transformed into a perfect diamond prison to capture the errant Phoenix shards. While the extent of their psychic powers while in full diamond form is unknown, they have been shown to telepathically communicate in this state, an ability that Emma does not share.</p><p>Alternate versions of the Cuckoos have also demonstrated the power of precognition. This may or may not be true for the Earth-616 Cuckoos.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-15104</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"216381\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\"><img id=\"216381\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Here Comes Tomorrow.</div></div></div></div><p>The Stepford Cuckoos also exist on Earth-15104, known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/here-comes-tomorrow/39-41708/\">Here Comes Tomorrow</a>. In this reality, there were only three of them left - Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe - and they called themselves the Three-in-One. They also seem to have a self-destruct sequence within their consciousness, and this is the first reference to the sisters being Weapon XIV. The Three-In-One assisted the new team of X-Men in this apocalyptic future. When the Sublime-controlled Beast reawoke and controls Jean Grey as the Phoenix, they alert the others. Sensing that the crazed Phoenix will burn away their minds, they initiate a self-destruct sequence, committing suicide.</p><h3>Earth-58163</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1100246\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super_super.jpg\" title=\"House of M\"><img id=\"1100246\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"House of M\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">House of M</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-58163, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>, all five Cuckoos were alive and well. Sophie still seemed to be the more dominant Cuckoo and still had the urge to be a heroine. When she found out that David and Nori were going to Japan to find Nori's father (who was labeled as a human terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D, who were also looking for him, but to put an end to him), Sophie decided that she wanted to help them and left her sisters to go to Japan.</p><p>Sophie proved to be quite an asset to the team that went to Japan (which included Prodigy, Surge, Jubilee, Dust, Wallflower and Mercury). Even though most of the human terrorists were shielded from psionic attacks, Sophie still had enough power to manipulate some of their thoughts, and make them do as she commanded. She also helped the New Mutants in a premature face-off with the Hellions, and when Quill attacked Prodigy, she commanded Quill to surrender to her, which he did. She also was able to scan minds, which was how she learned that Wallflower was really working with the people of an experiment known as 'Project Genesis' which was what the New Mutants and the human terrorists wanted to shut down.</p><p>Wallflower quickly used her pheromones to make all the parties involved (New Mutants, Hellions and the human terrorists) hate each other so much that they would fight to the death. This brawl was ended by Mercury, who was immune to Wallflower's pheromone manipulation, when she killed Wallflower. Wind Dancer of the Hellions, cleared the pheromones in the air with her wind-manipulating powers, and Sophie, knowing that the pheromones only fueled hatred that was already there, started to use her psionics to strip the hatred so there would be no more fighting. Tragically, Sophie was gunned down by a human terrorist who was immune to her psionic manipulation, as she was trying to make peace, but the gunman refused to be at peace with mutant-kind and wanted to fight them.</p><h3>Earth-91172</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"187948\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men: The End\"><img id=\"187948\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: The End\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men: The End</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-91172, a world ravaged by the Hulk, three of the Cuckoos are alive.

The team's first recorded adventure is cleaning up the complete destruction of bar caused by a fight between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/turk/29-9039/\">Turk</a>.</p>\n<p>On John's first day at work, the team tackles rebuilding downtown Manhattan after a battle between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-knight/29-3172/\">Black Knight</a> and one of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tinkerer/29-3144/\">Tinkerer</a>'s robots. It's during this clean-up Damage Control construction worker, Rex Randolph, finds a cosmic artifact that turns him into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/edifice-rex/29-43354/\">Edifice Rex</a>.</p>\n<p>A test of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>'s latest weapon invention goes wrong and turns an entire building into glass and Damage Control is called to help out. It's revealed that Doom hasn't paid his bill in over six month and after some debate, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> is sent to collect on Doom's account. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> charges into Damage Control's offices demanding to speak to someone because his insurance had told him he was no longer covered because his policy only covered the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a> works this out by having <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> growl over the phone to the insurance company and once <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> pays his deductible, all is well. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> finds out that Albert went by himself to collect from Doom and he summons the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> to rescue him. Albert turns out to not need help as he gets <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> to write a check himself and uncovers an embezzling scheme in the process. Once the account is paid, Damage Control can deal with the glass house in the way only Damage Control can.</p>\n<p>Head of marketing, Henry Ackerdson, comes up with a new Image Enhancement program for the firm. It includes splashy, action-filled commercials featuring Fix-It Man, Fix-It Girl and Fluppy, the dog. His plan also includes uniforms for all employees and the drilling of a tunnel from Damage Control headquarters to their Warehouse in New Jersey. Ackerdson gives the tunnel digging crew from Stark Enterprises the wrong coordinates and sends them drilling under the Hudson river which causes the tunnel to start to flood. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> saves the day by placing a big metal plate at the bottom of the river to stop the flooding. The warehouse is destroyed however. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> cancels the Image Enhancement program and makes Henry clean up the mess where the warehouse used to be.</p>\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inferno/39-41408/\">Inferno</a> event, Damage Control is asked by the county to investigate a series robberies of building supplies at construction sites and lumber yards and the team winds up at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> which is now a pile of rubble. Turns out some members of Damage Control had been there before to do some repair work and unwittingly unleashed a pack of robot clowns on the mansion. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> help round them up. Back in the present, the team learns that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a> is trying to rebuild the destroyed building and is responsible for the thefts. Damage Control shuts down the building's power and returns the stolen materials.</p><a></a>\n<h2>Round Two</h2>\n<p><b>\"After the earth-shattering conclusion...Once justice is served...When at the last possible moment, the world is again saved from the very brink of destruction...It's time to pick up the pieces...DAMAGE CONTROL!\"</b></p>\n<p>When we next see Damage Control it's smack in the middle of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/acts-of-vengeance/39-41931/\">Acts of Vengeance</a> storyline and the team is at the base of one of the support towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. The support has been destroyed and the only one keeping the whole bridge from tumbling to ruins is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> who's hoping DC can come up with a solution quick. Meanwhile back at Damage Control HQ, it is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a>'s last day and receptionist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne/29-43306/\">Anne</a> gives him a heck of a going away present. Elsewhere in the building, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> gets a phone call from President <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/george-bush/29-28108/\">George Bush</a> asking her to join the Commission On Superhuman Activities. She decides to take the job leaving <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin-chapel/29-43307/\">Robin Chapel</a> in charge of the business. Meanwhile, across the continent in Colorado, a prison break is in progress at The Vault and the escaping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a> finds their crowbar. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a> are sent to help out at The Vault after seeing to the repairs to the bridge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> goes to tell her business partners, Tony Stark and The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> about her new position and finds out they've sold their interests in the company to CarltonCo. Meanwhile at The Vault, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a> restore power and are promptly capture by The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderball/29-2253/\">Thunderball</a> recognizes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a> whom he met one day at the Damage Control offices and he convinces the rest of the Crew that they are not worth taking hostage. Soon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> arrives at The Vault to rescue our team and put the criminals back behind bars. Arriving back in New York, John and the rest of the team find out about the sale of Damage Control and find that CarltonCo has done a little work on the Damage Control Headquarters.</p>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a>'s trail of money leads the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> to Damage Control's newly redesigned headquarters. He busts in, guns drawn, only to be told to take a number and wait to be served. Using a robot of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> scares off the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a> gets Damage Control to retrieve the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-mansion/34-41036/\">Avengers Mansion</a> from underwater. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> discovers something strange in CarltonCo's reorganization plan for Damage Control and because of it <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> is fired. He vows revenge on Damage Control. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a> is promote to assistant and his first action is to hire a new intern in the form of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\">Robbie Baldwin</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> tracks <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin-chapel/29-43307/\">Robin Chapel</a> to her home but some quick thinking prevents him from causing any harm. Another part of the new business plan for Damage Control is not to honor the worker's negotiated contract which leads <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lenny-ballinger/29-43333/\">Lenny Ballinger</a> to call a strike!</p>\n<p>With Damage Control employees on strike, the destruction in the city is mounting. John and Robin try to figure out a solution. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rob-washington/29-43335/\">Rob Washington</a> is summed to a mysterious warehouse where he's offered a powerful battlesuit to extract his vengeance on the city in return for helping someone with their vengeance. Damage Control. John and Robin call in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> to help them repair buildings all over town. While fixing the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">Daily Bugle</a> building which had been knocked off it's foundation, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> is attacked by two men in battlesuits. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\">Robbie Baldwin</a> as Speedball comes to save the day and it is revealed that the mastermind behind the battlesuits is none other than <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a>. By the end of the day, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> is in jail, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">Daily Bugle</a> is on it's side, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-mansion/34-41036/\">Avengers Mansion</a> is back underwate and the strike is still ongoing with no end in sight! <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin-chapel/29-43307/\">Robin Chapel</a> calls <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> for guidance, but is told she has other matters to discuss. When she hangs up we see <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> is in a meeting with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> is plotting with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> to attempt a hostile takeover of Damage Control. Ray Lippert warns Robin and John that CarltonCo is willing to gut Damage Control to raise cash. Robin talks Lenny into getting the Damage Control crew to put off the strike for an afternoon to save some folks trapped in a collapsed building. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> arrives with a newly released <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a>, who it turns out used to work for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> and is truly sorry for the crimes he committed. Gene has an idea to stabilize the building from the inside. Meanwhile, Fury, Hoag and Cleary march into Mr. Souris' office to attempt the hostile takeover. Turns out Souris had used a loan from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> to purchase Damage Control. Cleary uses this information to make Souris agree to sell Damage Control back to Anne-Marie using money borrowed from Fury. Robin meets with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> to inform him that his dealings with Damage Control are now over. Hoag restores all Damage Control employees pay raises and the strike is over and the people in the collapsing building are saved. To wrap up the day, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a> restores Damage Control headquarters to it's original form.

        "description":"<h2><b>Origin</b></h2>\n<h3>Queen</h3>The Brood's civilization is based on insect societies such as the bees or ants consisting of a Hive-like lair. All Brood civilizations share strong telepathic bonds with their Queens, thus predicting no rebellions occurring against the Queens. The Broodlings do all the work and have an undying allegiance to their Queen, however each Queen do not share in a common interest. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3>Subspecies</h3>There are a few different types of Brood. Starting with the Broodlings who are brown in color and have known to have transparent wings. Next up is the Queen, which is also brown in colour and have no wings. They give out the orders to the Broodlings to fulfill. The second last are referred to as \"the Pure-Borns\", they are the firstborn offspring which have had no exposure to other races, they are green in color and rather large. <br />&nbsp;<br />Lastly, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood-empress/29-42767/\">  Empress Brood </a>which is also green in colour and extremely large, they are the supreme rulers of the Brood. Recently <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phyla/29-40922/\">  Phyla-Vell </a>(the new Quasar) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">  Moondragon </a>encountered and fought a newly discovered strain of the Brood species above the planet Dlaw-Neurg&nbsp;during the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilation-conquest/39-44982/\">  Annihilation: Conquest</a>. Unlike its brethren the Brood had no eyes, a brown-colored heavily armored exoskeleton and&nbsp;silver-colored wings.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The Brood also&nbsp;possessed the ability to&nbsp;breath in space and was at the very least three times the size of a full-grown Brood Empress. The creature, as far as anyone can tell, was&nbsp;little more than a feral beast and was not raised in a Hive-mind culture like its cousins. Moondragon later deducted that the Brood (along with&nbsp;a sand-dwelling&nbsp;member of a previously undiscovered gargantuan insectoid&nbsp;species) were the guardians of a deserted palace&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-warlock/29-6805/\">  Adam Warlock </a>once lived in&nbsp;sitting in the sand dunes of Dlaw-Neurg and therefore were not actually natives of Dlaw-Neurg leaving the Brood's true origins open to speculation. <br />&nbsp;<br />Recently, an unknown alien adversary of Kitty Pryde secretly infected her with an airborne virus that impregnated her with a microscopic Brood egg-sac, which made her body grow into that of a pregnant woman in her ninth month within a span of a few hours. It should be noted that these micro-Brood have been engineered to grow by consuming every last cell of their host from the inside-out and therefore must be removed before the Brood have a chance to grow out of control.<br />&nbsp;<h2>Creation<br /></h2>The Brood was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">  Chris Claremont</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\">  Dave Cockrum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-wiacek/26-3271/\">  Bob Wiacek</a> in 1982 and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">  Uncanny X-Men</a> # 155.<br />\n<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Brood Saga  </h3>Xavier and the X-Men are on a Shi'ar spaceship led by Lord Samedar and Araki. They tell the X-Men about Lilandra's kidnapping and their plan to invade Earth.&nbsp; The X-Men are opposed of course, so they head back to Earth and get Jarvis and Tigra to help.&nbsp; Deathbird and the Brood attack Corsair and Storm.&nbsp; The rest of the X-Men arrive to help them defeat the Brood, but Deathbird escapes and holds Xavier against his will. <br />&nbsp;<br />All of the X-Men were infected by the Brood, except Carol Danvers.&nbsp; Wolverine's healing factor saved himself by purging the virus.&nbsp; He saved the rest of the X-Men except for Fang who became a Brood Warrior.&nbsp; While the X-Men leave, the Brood Queen realizes this and instructs the Queen embryo inside Cyclops to stop them.&nbsp; They find a dead Acanti prophet and recover the \"Soul\" inside of a crystalline object in his brain.&nbsp; The Brood find the X-Men and defeat them while they mutate into the Brood themselves.&nbsp; The Soul starts to get corrupted as well, and Wolverine tries to stop his teammates.&nbsp; Carol arrives and has a new appearance due to the Brood experimenting on her, and she releases the Soul.&nbsp; It cures the X-Men, crystallizes the Brood Queen, and destroys the Broodworld.&nbsp; X-Men, Lilandra and Lockheed escape, as well as some of the Brood escaping from the exploding planet.<br /><br /><h3>Age of Apocalypse &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>In this reality, the Brood possessed the Shi'ar who later encounter the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">  Starjammers </a>which included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">  Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">  Havok's</a>&nbsp;father,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsair/29-7591/\">  Christopher Summers</a>. He ends up getting infected by the Brood. He later crashes on Earth and is later kept captive by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">  Mr. Sinister</a>. Christopher Summers later escapes the lab and meets up with his lost sons only to end up losing control to the Brood inside of him. He is then killed. In this reality another character infected was: <a href=\"/colleen-wing/29-1494/\"> Colleen Wing</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h3>Annihilation: Conquest<br /></h3><p>Annihilus and the Annihilation Wave (a race of insects) led an invasion and destroyed nearly all of the Brood species.<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h3>Planet Hulk (and World War Hulk)<br /></h3><p>In Planet Saakar, the Brood arrive and their Queen decides to mate with Miek, an insect king.&nbsp; They discover that Miek betrayed the Hulk, and the Queen and Hulk retaliate against Miek.&nbsp; The Earth Hive (an omni-consciousness of insects) decided to use Humbug to make the Queen infertile and kill the hivelings growing inside Humbug<br /><br /></p><h3>Ultimate X-Men<br /></h3><p>The Brood in the Ultimate Verse are <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">  Danger Room </a>programs.

At his side were Dr. <a href=\"/dr-cornelius/29-9393/\">Abraham Cornelius</a>, Dr. <a href=\"/hines/29-15697/\">Carol Hines</a> and Dr. <a href=\"/dale-rice/29-71214/\">Dale Rice</a>. <a href=\"/sublime/29-11330/\">John Sublime</a>, the director of <a href=\"/weapon-plus/65-40591/\">Weapon Plus</a>, was always behind the scenes. Some of the work of Weapon X was based on the experiments detailed on the journals of Nazi scientist <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Nathan Essex</a>, which were obtained by Weapon Plus after the end of World War II. The Project's original test subjects were the members of <a href=\"/team-x/65-49826/\">Team X</a>, a covert ops CIA team (<a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>/Logan, <a href=\"/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>/Victor Creed, <a href=\"/maverick/29-8307/\">Maverick</a>/Christoph Nord, <a href=\"/silver-fox/29-15696/\">Silver Fox</a>/Kayla Silverfox, <a href=\"/mastodon/29-27460/\">Mastodon</a>, and <a href=\"/john-wraith/29-3205/\">Kestrel</a>/John Wraith).</p><p>The telepath <a href=\"/aldo-ferro/29-27417/\">Psi-Borg</a> (Aldo Ferro) was involved in the creation of the victims' memory implants, in exchange for being endowed with immortality. The test subjects were policed by an adaptive robot enforcer, called <a href=\"/shiva/29-15390/\">Shiva</a>, should any of the agents go rogue. What the Weapon X scientists did not foresee is that the experimentation on Wolverine would cause him to go on a murderous rampage, which allowed the escape of the other test subjects, and caused the deaths of the Professor and Dale Rice, among dozens of other members of Weapon X staff, both scientists and military.</p><h3>The Facility</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76155\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/76155-132004-x-23_super.jpg\" title=\"X-23\"><img id=\"76155\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/76155-132004-x-23_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-23\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-23</div></div></div></div><p>Weapon X was temporarily shut down, but eventually was reinstated.

Like Weapon X once did, the Facility has also branched off from the main Weapon X Program.</p><p>Later creations of The Facility, now under the direction of Dr. <a href=\"/adam-harkin/29-65447/\">Adam Harkins</a>, include <a href=\"/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a>.</p><h3>Department K</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"403097\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/403097-127489-deadpool_super.JPG\" title=\"Deadpool\"><img id=\"403097\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/403097-127489-deadpool_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Deadpool\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Deadpool</div></div></div></div><p>At some point, Weapon X branched off from Weapon Plus' control and was solely headed up by Canada's Department K. A new generation of agents were created: <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a>, <a href=\"/garrison-kane/29-26923/\">Garrison Kane</a> (who took on the moniker \"Weapon X\"), <a href=\"/slayback/29-26752/\">Slayback</a>, <a href=\"/sluggo/29-15610/\">Sluggo</a>, and <a href=\"/ajax/29-20609/\">Ajax</a>, among others. Weapon X used Logan's DNA in order to endow its agents with healing powers. The batch produced many additional failures, which were sent to a facility for dissection to determine the cause of their failures.</p><p>These rejects were freed by <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> when he escaped from the facility. A smaller experiment was later developed by Department K with a New Zealand terrorist, who would become the third individual to be known as Weapon X, merging him with a symbiotic bacteria colony.</p><h3>New Weapon X</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79465\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/79465-81749-the-director_super.jpg\" title=\"The Director\"><img id=\"79465\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/79465-81749-the-director_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Director\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Director</div></div></div></div><p>Director <a href=\"/the-director/29-15621/\">Malcolm Colcord</a> forms the third version of the Weapon X Project, designed to monitor and eliminate mutants. <a href=\"/the-director/29-15621/\">Colcord</a>, once a security guard at the first Weapon X project, suffered severe facial lacerations during an escape attempt by the mutant Wolverine. Unlike the previous two installments of Weapon X, the third Project was completely U.S.-based and focused not only on the creation of living weapons, but also on the ultimate goal of Colcord, the creation of death camps. The Director initially uses Weapon X as his personal strike force to exact revenge against Wolverine. He soon begins utilizing its resources for the capturing and imprisonment of mutants in the secret government death camp called <a href=\"/neverland/34-55994/\">Neverland</a>. Mutants who are not suitable to be used as military weapons would be executed, while those that are suitable are given the choice to join Weapon X or die. A number of mutants, such as <a href=\"/cecilia-reyes/29-14177/\">Cecilia Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/maggott/29-15072/\">Maggott</a>, <a href=\"/ape/29-13368/\">Ape</a>, <a href=\"/tar-baby/29-14553/\">Tarbaby</a>, <a href=\"/leech/29-3193/\">Leech</a> and many others were arrested by Weapon X's agents and sent to Neverland. Those mutants deemed useless to the project were killed in gas chambers, while others were brainwashed to become Weapon X operatives. The organs of the executed prisoners were then sent to the <a href=\"/u-men/65-47994/\">U-Men</a>. The agents of the third Weapon X were <a href=\"/agent-brent-jackson/29-15622/\">Agent Brent Jackson</a> a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent; Sabretooth, who was given new adamantium implants; the shapeshifter <a href=\"/copycat/29-13311/\">Copycat</a>, Deadpool, and <a href=\"/mauvais/29-15624/\">Mauvais</a>.</p><p>Later on, Deadpool went rogue and new operatives were recruited into Weapon X, many of whom had their powers enhanced or were brainwashed into servitude. Maverick was saved from certain death and his powers were enhanced with the purpose of assassinating Wolverine, thus Agent Zero was created. Former member of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a> <a href=\"/wild-child/29-9476/\">Wildchild</a> was brainwashed and further mutated into a Nosferatu-like feral humanoid. Former mutant terrorist Marrow had her powers set to a controllable level, restoring the young woman's natural beauty. <a href=\"/sauron/29-3180/\">Sauron</a>'s personality was merged with that of his Karl Lykos self and his energy-draining powers enhanced so he could fire energy blasts. Garrison Kane was further transformed into a cybernetic being. Aurora was kidnapped and brainwashed, like <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/29-24399/\">Madison Jeffries</a>, who was extracted from the terrorist group known as the Zodiac and used to create hundreds of Boxbots loyal to Weapon X to serve as guards at Neverland. Washout had his powers enhanced, though at a heavy cost. Each usage of his powers endangered his life and eventually, he dies trying to kill Colcord. <a href=\"/mesmero/29-5065/\">Mesmero</a> joins willingly, while <a href=\"/reaper/29-10317/\">Reaper</a> and <a href=\"/wildside/29-14842/\">Wildside</a>, former members of the Mutant Liberation Front, became agents of the program in exchange for their lives. The psychic mutant Jack-in-the-Box joins after his legs and arms were amputated. He becomes a living polygraph.</p><p>Unbeknown to all, except Sabretooth, Mister Sinister was disguised as the head scientist at the Neverland facility, Doctor Robert Windsor. As Windsor, Sinister supposedly helped some mutants escape from Neverland, but he was only taking them to his own secret labs. After some time, Brent Jackson, the only human officially on the team, took over as Director, during a mutiny by the team in conjunction with an attack by mutants from the Underground. Cable led this group, in a mission to destroy Weapon X and expose its existence and its human rights violations. Washout and Garrison Kane died in the event, while Sabretooth was washed away into the sewers after a battle with Marrow. Marrow used the battle to escape from Weapon X, eventually taking over the Mutant Underground, now reformed as the third incarnation of Gene Nation. Colcord fled Weapon X, with the always loyal Jeffries, and Aurora as well. Director Brent Jackson's team consisted of Wildchild, Sauron, Agent Zero, Mesmero, Jack-in-the-Box, and newly recruited Chamber, whose face was restored by the program's scientists.</p><p>Chamber was originally a double agent working for the X-Men, but was subsequently brainwashed into Jackson's service. Mister Sinister, under the alias of Dr. Windsor, remains at Weapon X. At some point, Jackson's team fought with Colcord's Boxbots. Colcord regains control of Weapon X. A person claiming to be Chamber has joined a superhero team known as Excelsior, but that person turned out to be an impostor. Following M-Day, both Chamber and Mesmero are rendered powerless. Neverland is shut down and the prisoners, either powered or depowered, are executed by hosts of Boxbots. Records of the massive executions are discovered by Beast in the Endangered Species storyline, which also hints that some of the bodies of the prisoners executed prior to M-Day were sent to Ord and used in the research to develop the cure for mutation.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>Logan uses the name Weapon X instead of Wolverine. Additionally, Deadpool didn't receive his healing factor from Weapon X, but from Apocalypse.</p>",
