They also discovered the climate-controlling technology and used it to keep the volcanoes working. They mastered genetic engineering. They experimented on the various species living in the Savage Land, and were then forced to work for the Atlantians until they revolted. The Atlantians used the technology to expand the Savage Land. However, the Atlantians were overthrown and the expanded areas in the Savage Land remained.</p><p>After some years, the Savage Land was discovered by a man named Lord Robert Plunder who took back a metal which could liquefy all other metals. The discovery of this metal meant that others would want to steal his discovery, so he took his eldest son Kevin, and went back to the Savage Land. However, Lord Robert Plunder was killed by a local tribe of Man-Apes, and Kevin grew up in the Savage Land, known better as <a href=\"/ka-zar/29-3558/\">Ka-Zar</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1737425\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1737425-avalon_super.jpg\" title=\"Antarctic\"><img id=\"1737425\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1737425-avalon_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Antarctic\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Antarctic</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, <a href=\"/avalon/34-41283/\">Avalon</a> was the last refuge of Humans and Mutants who wanted to escape <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>\u00b4s tyranny.

His younger sister <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/29-6144/\">  Lilandra</a> and her new allies, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">  X-Men</a>, foiled his plans. He was rendered comatose by the crystal, and Lilandra then took over as the Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire. The X-Men, as well as most of Earth's other superheroes, have had cordial if not friendly relations with the Shi'ar Empire ever since.<br /><strong>Deathbird</strong> <p>In the 1980s, Lilandra and D'Ken's unstable exiled elder sibling, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathbird/29-6089/\">  Deathbird</a>, made several attempts to overthrow her sister from power. Deathbird even resorted to attacking Lilandra's Earth-based allies in order to achieve her goals. She is also responsible for initially directing the alien parasites known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood/65-4987/\">  Brood</a> towards the Earth and its heroes. Deathbird was eventually deposed with the assistance of the X-Men. In the 1992 crossover <em><i>Operation: Galactic Storm</i></em>, the Shi'ar annexed the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">  Kree</a> Empire at the end of the Kree-Shi'ar War and Deathbird was placed into a prominent position as viceroy of Hala, the Kree homeworld. However, Deathbird did not last long in this position and the current status of the Kree territories is unclear.

Inhabiting the body of her brother, Nova asserts control of Empress Lilandra and causes a Shi'ar civil war. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">  Jean Grey</a> is instrumental in ending this threat.<br /><br /><strong>Phoenix Endsong &amp; End of Greys</strong></p> <p>Even though Jean Grey did the Shi'ar a big favor by eliminating the threat of Cassandra Nova, the Shi'ar still want her dead. In the Phoenix Endsong series, a group of Shi'ar tried to permanently kill the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">  Phoenix Force</a> and Jean Grey. Jean, however, escaped their suicide bomb attack and returned to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/white-hot-room/34-50483/\">  White Hot Room</a> to restore herself. In the recent \"End of Greys\" story arc, the Shi'ar wanted to wipe out the Grey genome and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-omega/29-40583/\">  Quentin Quire</a> with the purpose of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar-death-commandos/65-55991/\">  Shi'ar Death Commandos</a> murdered Jean Grey's father, niece, nephew, and other relatives in an alien invasion on Earth, thus inciting the wrath of Jean's daughter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">  Rachel Summers</a>, who has vowed vengeance on the entire Shi'ar Empire.

Once he arrived on Earth, Gladiator came into conflict with The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">  Fantastic Four</a> and was forced to face <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-universe/29-27193/\">  Captain Universe</a> (who had merged with The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">  Invisible Woman</a>) in combat,&nbsp;which nearly cost Gladiator his life. The Uni-Power then merged with the badly injured Gladiator and showed him that it did not pose a threat to anyone. After saving Los Angeles from a tsunami, Gladiator extended to The Uni-Power, an invitation to come back with him to The &nbsp;Shi'ar&nbsp;Throneworld&nbsp;as a guest while their scientists tried to solve The Uni-Power's dilemma.<br /><br />Unfortunately while Gladiator and The Uni-Power were en route to the Empire both of them were captured by an energy-consuming reptilian space vampire who called himself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krosakis/29-44347/\">  Krosakis</a>, who not only stripped Gladiator of all his power but also forced The Uni-Power into merging with him, thus turning Krosakis into Captain Universe. Luckily The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">  Silver Surfer </a>was able to sense The Uni-Power's plight and defeated Krosakis by overloading him with The Power Cosmic. The Surfer then&nbsp;permanently infused a portion of The Power Cosmic into The Uni-Power and repaired it, considering all they had been through over the years Gladiator believed The Surfer when he said The Uni-Power had been cured and allowed it to return to Earth while he took Krosakis back to The Shi'ar Throneworld so he could be placed on trial for his crimes.<br /><br /> <h3>Annihilation</h3><br />As the war against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/29-10964/\">  Annihilus</a>' invasion forces&nbsp;tore countless neighboring Star Empires asunder Peter Quill a.k.a.

During his tenure as majestor of the empire, D'Ken killed Vulcan's mother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/katherine-summers/29-15328/\">  Katherine Summers</a> (also mother to long time X-Men Scott and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">  Alex Summers</a>) and made him a slave for most of his adolescent life. Bent on revenge against D'Ken, Vulcan attacks the Empire. Not only that, but within the empire, there is a coup to dethrone Lilandra and return D'Ken to power, with the aid of Deathbird. The X-Men once again team up with their space allies, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">  Starjammers</a>, to stop both Vulcan and the plot to return rulership of the empire to D'Ken. In the end, Vulcan kills his father, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsair/29-7591/\">  Corsair</a>, and D'Ken, and assumes the throne of the Shi'ar Empire for himself, with Deathbird as his queen; Lilandra and the Starjammers now lead a resistance against Vulcan's rule.<br /><br /><strong>Emperor Vulcan</strong></p> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"138740\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/138740-134228-vulcan_super.jpg\" title=\"Vulcan\"><img id=\"138740\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/138740-134228-vulcan_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Vulcan\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vulcan</div></div></div></div>The civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal the dethroned Lilandra rages on. Led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">  Havok</a> and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan's forces, which are plagued by defections. The Shi'ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him. Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather's Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, is destroyed by the Scy'ar Tal (translates as \"Death to the Shi'ar\"). Vulcan and Gladiator (still the praetor of his Imperial Guard) attack the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi'ar space. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">  Marvel Girl</a> makes contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi'ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra &amp; K'ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their name to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi'ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire. Under the ceasefire, the Shi'ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy'ar's biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy'ar trys to stop them. Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy'ar become unorganized, and the tide of the battle shifts to the Shi`ar. The Shi'ar then proceed to attack both the Scy'ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun. Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy'ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decides to end things with Vulcan. While they battle, Rachael and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/korvus/29-41208/\">  Korvus</a> try, but fail to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">  Imperial Guard</a> end Alex's battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declares that he will return the Shi'ar Empire to its former glory.",

        "description":"<h2>Location of Krypton</h2><p><b>Krypton</b> was located close to <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a>, at least in cosmic terms. It was 50 light years from Earth and orbited a red giant star known as <a href=\"/rao/29-45048/\">Rao</a>. Krypton is roughly Earth sized and was part of <a href=\"../../green-lantern/12-41148/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern</a> sector 2813 (Earth is in sector 2814). However, in the story \"Superman: Birthright\", Krypton was said to be in another galaxy, approximately 2.2 million light-years away. Krypton is home to a race of people known as Kryptonians that are similar to humans but are more closely related to Daxamites. Under their red sun, the Kryptonians became a more technologically advanced society.</p><h2>The People and Culture</h2><p>Krypton was a world renowned for its scientific achievement. As a culture, the people lead an idyllic life surrounded by robots and followed a ritual path through life. One of their achievements was their Clone Banks. Their mastery of cloning allowed them to live an eternal youth and their society grew ever more hedonistic. In these banks each Kryptonian would maintain three mindless Clones which could be used as spare parts if their \"owner\" was ever injured. There was growing concern however, that the clones too had rights. At first what started out to be a pacifist movement ended up being The Clone Rights Movement that began with the teachings of Sem-M. One clone gained independent sentience, causing the debate to escalate into conflict. Eventually the Clone Rights Movement formed such a large force that they rebelled against the ruling authority. The advanced scientific knowledge of the Kryptonians was turned into super weapons and Krypton's Clone War began. Two weapons were created at this time, the <a href=\"../../eradicator/29-5377/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eradicator</a> and the Destroyer. The Eradicator had altered the genes of Kryptonians so that they could never leave their planet again. The Destroyer was aimed at the planet's core, by pro-clone forces causing a chain reaction. The Destroyer was stopped when the government ended hostilities and the planet was saved.</p><p>Krypton would never be the same. The world was left with no wildlife and the people began living in isolation from one another and other races. Direct physical contact became prohibited and procreation was facilitated by birthing matrices. Krypton had peace again, but their world was sterile and joyless.</p><p>Daxamites</p><p>The people of <a href=\"../../daxam/34-42416/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daxam</a> originated on Krypton. They left to explore the universe, though they were altered by the Eradicator as they left, leaving them fatally vulnerable to lead.</p><h2>Points of Interest</h2><h3>The Anti-Gravity Sky Palace</h3><p>A marvel of Kryptonian engineering - this domed structure hovers above the planet's surface.</p><h3>Argo City</h3><p>This city was flung into space by a Krypton-quake.

The scientist, <a href=\"../../jor-el/29-9561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jor-El</a> discovered that the planet would soon explode. Jor-El was unable to convince his associates of the impending danger, who could not conceive of leaving Krypton and was himself prevented from leaving. However, he sent his child's birthing matrix to safety shortly before the planet exploded.</p><h2>Notable Residents</h2><p>Krypton is most famous for being the birthplace of Kal-El, better known as <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a>. It was also home to his parents, Jor-El and <a href=\"../../lara/29-9562/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lara</a> and his cousin, Kara Zor-El ( <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>).

Many people looking to add something new to Krypton, trying to find different ways about the dead planet's origin as their inspiration , began to realize that for a planet that exploded had a lot of survivors. So in Superman: The Movie this allowed designer John Barry (who also did Star Wars and A Clockwork Orange) to create Krypton into a crystalline utopia. This version of Krypton featured a highly advanced society, where this planet is crime-free. Criminals will be banished into outer space until the criminal's crime intention was completely erased and he/she will be put to use again after his/her sentence is over.This kind of sentence was completely ignored after Jor-El discovered the Phantom Zone.This Planet Krypton was destroyed due to Krypton's unstable uranium core exploding.</p><p><b>Krypton of Earth-Prime</b></p><p>This version of Krypton is where Superboy-Prime comes from. This Krypton had a unstable red sun that threatened to consume the whole planet. Jor-El and Lara initially tried to build a device that could teleport them across the galaxy. The prototype of the machine that they built was able to carry no more than fifty Kryptonian pounds of weight. <a href=\"/jor-el/29-9561/\">Jor-El</a> knew that the council of science was not considering taking action. At the very last moment when their red sun threatens to consumed their world, he put <a href=\"/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Kal-El</a> in his prototype machine, where the machine transmitted Kal-El's atoms across the galaxy, so the child would be safely rematerialized on Earth. Moments after that, a large radioactive solar flare that was generated by Krypton's red sun completely consumed the entire planet. Everyone there died instantly.</p><p><b>Krypton of Earth-Two</b></p><p>This is where the Golden Age Superman comes from.There is nothing much to know about this Krypton. However, it is stated that everyone of this Krypton possessed super-powers due to their \"millions of years of evolution\",although to a quite lower extant.This Krypton was destroyed due to \"old-age\".</p><h2>Krypton In JLU</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"445754\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/445754-pan06_super.jpg\" title=\"Krypton: In The Mind Of Superman\"><img id=\"445754\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/445754-pan06_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Krypton: In The Mind Of Superman\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Krypton: In The Mind Of Superman</div></div></div></div><p>In the <a href=\"/justice-league-unlimited/65-45101/\">Justice League Unlimited</a> Episode, \"For The Man Who Has Everything\" <a href=\"/mongul/29-12162/\">Mongul</a> enters the <a href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/%20\">Fortress of Solitude</a> on Superman's birthday and gives him a gift called the Black Mercy, an animal that attaches to your chest and grants people their every desire. When the animal attached itself to <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>, it made Superman a <a href=\"/krypton/34-30670/\">Krypton</a> and on this planet his parents was still alive and he had a his own wife Loana and son Van-El. After having many tremors and hearing the voices of <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>, he realized that it was all a dream and he had to end up giving up evrything he loved. Despite much pain from having to give up knowing what he had come to love more than anything, he was able to tear away from this dream world, resulting in another destruction of Krypton but this one being nothing more than just a dream.

They hid all of their knowledge in the form of a crystal that was broken into three parts, creating the Stones of Power. The chosen Kryptonian journeyed to the planet Earth where he hid the stones at three different locations; this Kryptonian also came across a tribe of Indians known as the Kawatche and started a new prophecy on Earth about how he would return from the stars to save their world or send another chosen Kryptonian.</p><p><a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Dax-Ur\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dax-Ur</a> was one of the greatest scientists to live on Krypton. He designed the <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Brainiac\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brain InterActive Construct</a>, a self-aware, conscious supercomputer that could permanently run Krypton on a day-to-day basis without the need for manual labor. Dax-Ur then realized the destruction his creation could cause if it fell into the wrong hands and abandoned his designs without completing their construction. He fled Krypton, seeking solace on Earth, where he planned to study the effects that the planet's yellow sun had on various Kryptonian minerals.</p><p>In 1961, Jor-El traveled to Earth as a rite of passage by his father, and unwittingly fell in love with Louise McCallum and met Hiram and Jessica Kent. He left his memories, stored in a memory pendant, behind on Earth and returned to Krypton.</p><p>Jor-El and Lara met sometime after his adventures on Earth, and the two were married sometime before he became a member of the Ruling Council.</p><p>In 1966, a terrible war was fought against the forces of Black Zero, who succeeded in destroying the Kryptonian city of Kandor; among those killed were the wife and young son of Zod who, at that time, was a major in Krypton's military. During this time, the Council commissioned Jor-El to construct an Orb containing the DNA of Krypton's strongest (including Zod and Jor-El himself) with the intent of sending it to Earth so they would be resurrected if Krypton was ever destroyed. Kandor was re-built sometime after its destruction by Black Zero.</p><p>Years after the death of his wife and son, Zod rose to the rank of General, married Faora and began his plans to take over Krypton.</p><h3><span id=\"The_War\">The War</span><span></span></h3><h4><span id=\"Early_War\">Early War</span><span></span></h4><p>Zod was a strong believer in the old barbaric ways of Kryptonian society, and believed that his people had become weak and therefore needed to be dictated. So over the years as he grew in power, he gathered loyal disciples and forces that he would use in an attempt to overthrow the Ruling Council and conquer Krypton. When he believed that he had enough forces, Zod mounted an attack on Krypton, beginning a war with the Council.</p><p>After the war had been going on for some time, Zod had caused damage to the Council, so they asked Jor-El to create Dax-Ur's Brain InterActive Construct to aid in the war against Zod, using its extensive knowledge to help the Council defeat Zod. However, Zod learned of the creation of Brainiac and was able to corrupt it, making it an ally to him and his disciples.</p><p>During this time, Zor-El attempted to kill Jor-El, believing that his brother had stolen Lara from him. After his assassination attempt on Jor-El, he was disgraced as a scientist and became the operator for Kandor's mine. Zod used Zor-El's hatred of Jor-El against Krypton, and Zor-El joined Zod's efforts to take over Krypton.</p><p>Since Zod and Faora were unable to conceive children after trying for so long, they decided that, by using genetic engineering, they would create their own ultimate son. Zod and Faora gathered the DNA of the most violent Kryptonian species and fused them all together with their own DNA. They planned to send their \"<a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Doomsday\" rel=\"nofollow\">son</a>\" to Earth, where he would destroy the population, leaving the planet deserted so that, in case Zod could not rule Krypton, they would rule Earth as a <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/House_of_Zod\" rel=\"nofollow\">family</a> instead.</p><p>Zod gave major roles in the war to his two closest disciples, Aethyr and <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Nam-Ek\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nam-Ek</a>, whom he would let make decisions on where their forces should attack. Nam-Ek and Aethyr often conversed with Zor-El, who would tell them of the Council's plans and where would be best to attack and weaken the Council.</p><h4><span id=\"Leading_to_Krypton.27s_Destruction\">Leading to Krypton's Destruction</span><span></span></h4><p>Krypton began experiencing massive tremors during the war, and the Council asked Jor-El to investigate. Jor-El suspected that the tremors where caused because Zor-El was operating Kandor's mine (the last one remaining not in Zod's hands) at full capacity, mining too deep. When the Council questioned Zor-El, he claimed that, without the mine working at full power, the Council would not have enough resources for the war, and that the tremors were temporary and caused by the attacks suffered during the war. Convinced, the Council allowed Zor-El to continue operating the mine at the same capacity.</p><p>Zor-El, however, had a different agenda. A strong believer in Rao's prophecy, he believed himself to be the chosen Kryptonian who would rise on Earth and create a paradise. Because of this, when he realized that Zod was starting to fulfill the prophecy by ravaging Krypton, Zor-El decided that he would complete the prophecy by igniting the planet's core and destroy Krypton.</p><p>Jor-El and the Council eventually managed to apprehend Zod and most of his followers.Jor-El convinced the Council to destroy all portals leading to Earth in order to prevent the rest of Zod's followers from escaping through them. The Council and Jor-El destroyed Zod's physical body and placed his essence in the Phantom Zone, along with his wife Faora, leaving them with no escape unless they inhabited a Kryptonian vessel.</p><p>After Zod was captured, Jor-El learned about his association with Zor-El. He forced his brother to stop the dangerous mining operations and placed him under arrest by locking him inside the powered-off mine control room. Zor-El was almost finished with the ignition of the planet's core, so he commanded Brainiac to override the lockdown, allowing him to complete the ignition and escape.</p><h3><span id=\"Destruction\">Destruction</span><span></span></h3><p>Zor-El made plans for him and Kara to flee Krypton before its destruction, but she found out about his ties with Zod and tried to expose him. Zor-El, with the help of his disciple Augo, tried to stop Kara, but she was able to notify Lara. When Zor-El tried to stop Kara, she pushed him into a cluster of hologram crystals, injuring him. Zor-El then erased Kara's memory and sent her away to Earth in a spaceship along with a blue crystal that contained his DNA, which could create a clone of him since his injury prevented him from traveling to Earth with Kara.He also put Lara's DNA in the crystal for two reasons: Because of his feelings towards her, and to lure his nephew Kal-El to the crystal should Kara fail to complete her task.</p><p>After Kara contacted Lara, she warned Jor-El about Zor-El's plan to ignite Krypton's core. So they sent their only son Kal-El in a <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Kal-El%27s_ship\" rel=\"nofollow\">spaceship</a> to Earth away from Krypton's doom. Sometime before Kal-El left Krypton, Zod and Faora had attached the genetic matter that was their \"<a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Davis_Bloome\" rel=\"nofollow\">son</a>\" to Kal-El's ship.</p><p>Jor-El placed his assistant <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Raya\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raya</a> in the Phantom Zone to escape while he and Lara went to try and stop Krypton's destruction.</p><p>In 2008, Brainiac traveled with Kara back through time to Krypton just before its destruction, in an attempt to kill Kal-El before he grew up to save Earth. He tracked down Kal-El and his ship, presumably killing Jor-El and Lara, before Kara attempted to stop him. Brainiac easily overpowered Kara (who was powerless due to Krypton's red sun) when Clark arrived from the future; Brainiac overpowered him as well. That distracted him enough for Kara to find a sharp crystal and stab it through Brainiac, weakening him as Clark placed baby Kal-El in his ship, sending him to Earth as planned.</p><p>After Brainiac began igniting the planet's core, he contacted Nam-Ek and Aethyr, and told them that Zod had indeed been placed in the Phantom Zone and that the only way they could release him was to locate the Stones of Power before Kal-El; otherwise, they would have to force Kal-El. The three of them were able to escape from Krypton in another spaceship, known as the <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Ship\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Ship</a>.</p><p>Shortly after they all escaped, Krypton's core eventually ignited, leading to the total destruction of the planet, killing billions of people, including Jor-El, Lara, Zor-El, and the Ruling Council.</p><h2><span id=\"Interplanetary_Relationships\">Interplanetary Relationships</span><span></span></h2><p>Krypton had noticeable relationships with other planets and galaxies, as it was one of the most powerful and advanced civilizations in the universe. Some planets saw Kryptonians as a cold and harsh race. Many other planets looked up to Kryptonians as god-like creatures whereas others would despise their power and greatly hate Kryptonians.</p><p>Some planets, such as Earth and Mars, had good relationships with Krypton, with Kryptonians traveling to Earth frequently via portals. These trips to Earth spawned many Kryptonian connections to Earth, including the birth of the Kawatche tribe and the occult interests in the Stones of Power by the witches Margaret Isobel Thoreaux and her disciples Brianna Withridge and Madelyn Hibbins. Kryptonians, benevolent or otherwise, saw Earth as a paradise due to the powers and abilities they gained under the planet's yellow sun; this caused Earth to become the prime conduit of Krypton's affairs. Martians also had a good relationship with Krypton, as the Martian Manhunter would often go to Krypton to aid his friend Jor-El, but some Kryptonians would look down on Martians as a lower species. The planet Almerac was a distant planet to Krypton, and their young would often be told stories about Krypton, in particular Kryptonian men and about how brave and gallant they were and many Kryptonian men were desired as mates by Almeracian women.</p><p>The destruction of Krypton is well-known throughout the universe, with many species having knowledge of its destruction.</p><h2><span id=\"Notable_Citizens\">Notable Citizens</span><span></span></h2><ul><li><b>Ruling Council</b>: A democratic group that were established and appointed to office sometime after the Kryptonians evolved from strict, lethal warriors to gentle, technologically efficient people.</li><li><b>Jor-El's Father</b>: A citizen of Krypton, and father of Jor-El and Zor-El; he sent his son Jor-El to Earth as a rite of passage in 1961.</li><li><b>Jor-El</b>: The father of Kal-El, Jor-El was a highly-respected scientist on Krypton and an influential member of the Ruling Council.</li><li><b>Lara-El</b>: The mother of Kal-El and loyal wife to Jor-El, Lara was a loving mother and also aunt to Kara, and notified Jor-El about Zor-El's plan to destroy Krypton, giving their son a chance to get off the planet alive.</li><li><b>Kal-El</b>: The son of Jor-El and Lara, Kal-El was born on Krypton a couple of weeks prior to its destruction and sent to Earth by his parents, who believed he would be safe there and destined to save Earth from destruction.</li><li><b>Zor-El</b>: The father of Kara and brother of Jor-El, he caused Krypton's destruction by igniting its core, believing in Rao's prophecy that he would be resurrected on Earth and create utopia.</li><li><b>Dax-Ur</b>: A scientist who designed the Brain InterActive Construct, later dubbed Brainiac.

The planet's terrain was slightly similar to Earth's except for the crystalline architecture of its buildings, its constant cold temperatures and its icy ground; therefore, the <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, with its crystalline appearance, is a re-creation of Kryptonian landscape, with its crisscrossing crystal towers. Krypton had oceans that ran between the massive continents of frozen plateaus, much like Earth's geography with its land sea.</p><p>Krypton's climate was cold and still. It is unknown how far Krypton was from its red sun, but had to be close enough to sustain life and water.</p><p>Doomsday is the result of his parents Zod and Faora fusing their genetic matter with DNA taken from the most violent, vicious and malevolent creatures that, apparently, can be found on Krypton; these creatures roamed the planet, and were most likely avoided by most Kryptonians.</p><h2><span id=\"Education\">Education</span><span></span></h2><p>In <i>Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton</i>, Kara attended an educational facility with other young Kryptonians. It was a crystalline structure similar in design to the Fortress of Solitude. The building was destroyed during the war with Zod, after Zor-El planned for it to be attacked by Zod's army in Kandor. Both Kara and Augo narrowly escaped damage from the blast.</p><h2><span id=\"Location\">Location</span><span><a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Krypton?action=edit&amp;section=12\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></span></h2><p>Clark tells Chloe Sullivan that he's \"not from anywhere near this galaxy.\" Later, Kara asks Clark how pieces of their home planet traveled through 23 galaxies. There are 28 known and inhabited galaxies in the <i>Smallville</i> universe, so that suggests that Earth and Krypton are very far apart.</p><p>The closest galaxy of comparable scope to the Milky Way Galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy, which is approximately 2,560,000 light-years away. The closest body capable of being called a galaxy is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, approximately 25,000 light-years away. Even if Krypton was in this mini-galaxy, it would still take at least 25,000 years before Earth would notice its disappearance. However, since kryptonite traveled across 23 galaxies, Krypton must be much further away than this.</p><p>We know that Jor-El came to Earth in the early 1960s, therefore meaning that Krypton may have existed at least until 40 years earlier. However, since Kryptonian technology has demonstrated the capacity to manipulate time, it is possible the teleportation portals connected different points in time as well as space. This would be consistent with our present understanding of the consequences of a fold in space-time, or wormhole.</p><p>Also, Dr. Virgil Swann states that he traced the signal from Krypton \"billions of miles\" to where the star should have been. While this is not technically wrong, a more logical and comfortable measure of the distance to the stars would be given in <i>trillions</i> of miles, not billions.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Created by</h2><p>Arkham Asylum was created by <a href=\"/dennis-oneil/26-40861/\">Denny O'Neil</a> (one of the editors for DC) who is also the co-creator of <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra's Al Ghu</a>l, <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/29-4917/\">Talia al Ghul</a> and <a href=\"/man-bat/29-6131/\">Man Bat</a>. In 1974 it was Dennis O'Neil who first explored the deep psychology of Batman's inner ego. It was this that later lead O'Neil to creating a Psych Ward aka Arkham Asylum, which has since inspired origin stories, video games, and graphic novels.</p><h2>Origin</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"225554\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10376/225554-30431-arkham-asylum_super.jpg\" title=\"Welcome to Arkham\"><img id=\"225554\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10376/225554-30431-arkham-asylum_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Arkham\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Welcome to Arkham</div></div></div></div><p>The history of Arkham Asylum began in the early 1900s. Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane is named after Elizabeth Arkham, who was the mother of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amadeus-arkham/29-50547/\">Amadeus Arkham</a>, the founder. Amadeus\u2019s mother was suffering from mental illness and eventually committed suicide. Amadeus became the sole heir to the Arkham estate and decided to treat mentally ill patients in order for those to not go through what his mother went though. Amadeus also got married to a woman named Constance and had a daughter name Harriet. He decided to turn his family home into an asylum to treat patients, but while it was being built he treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital, while also living at the Hospital with his family. Eventually the family would move back to their home at the Arkham house, while back at home Arkham was notified by the police that one of his patient named Martin \u201c Mad Dog\u201d Hawkins had escaped from prison.</p><p>On April 1, 1921 Arkham returns home and discovers his wife raped and murdered laying next to their lifeless daughter with \u201cMad Dog\u201d carved on her body. The same year Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened in November. One of the first patients was Martin Hawkins himself, who Arkham personally insisted on treating. On April 1, 1922 Martin Hawkins was strapped to an electric chair for \u201ctreatment\u201d and was electrocuted to death. The death was covered up as an \u201caccident\u201d and Arkham began to fall into madness, believing that the reason he lives is to be an executioner. Arkham would be institutionalized at his own mental hospital, Arkham Asylum, later in life. Arkham died as an inmate in his own asylum.</p><p>Arkham Asylum would later be used to imprison some truly insane characters, for example, the Joker and Two-Face who were one of the first inmates of Arkham Asylum. Arkham soon came to imprison all of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>\u2019s supervillain enemies whether they are insane or not.</p><h2>Notable Arkham Staff</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/alyce-sinner/29-71931/\">Alyce Sinner</a>: Director of the facility</li><li><a href=\"/aaron-cash/29-57326/\">Aaron Cash</a>: Senior Security Guard</li><li><a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Bruce Wayne</a>: Shareholder</li></ul><h3>Ex-Members of Arkham:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/jeremiah-arkham/29-27541/\">Jeremiah Arkham</a> - Son of Amadeus.

The castle since the loss of its original owner has been taken care\n of by generations of women taking upon the mantle called the sorceress,\n the first was Queen Veena the wife of King Grayskull. many centuries \npass and the current care taker and now sorceress is <a>         Teela-na</a>, Mother of <a>          Teela</a>.&nbsp; <br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; The castle itself lies in the lands owned by the eternian kingdom Eternos, which is control by <a>        King Randor</a>, ancient descendant of King Grayskull. much of the history of castle grayskull faded into obscurity and legend as the <a>       Council of Elders</a>\n took over as watchers of Eternia. The Castle sits in the northern \nregion of the evergreen forest of the Light Hemisphere. It would be only\n after the appearance of He-man that the castle becomes a point of \ninterest and a military focal point between the palace of Eternos and \nthe variety of creatures that would seek to gain access to the castle. <br />\n<h2>Other Media<br />\n</h2><div><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/251/337359-31731-castle-greyskull_super.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/251/337359-31731-castle-greyskull_medium.jpg\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">&nbsp;Filmation Castle Grayskull\n</div></div></div></div>\n<h3><u>He-man and the Masters of the Universe (Filmation 1983):</u><br />\n</h3>\n&nbsp;Back during the original series, There was no origin of the castle \nstated, only just a legend that it would appear when all hope was lost. \nThis series also does not mention what the secret of castle grayskull \nwas, but that Skeletor was determined to capture, destroy, or get what \never secret there was inside.

The area is monitored by robots, and the specific jail is officially known as the Negative Zone Prison Alpha, yet it is more commonly known as 42. Shortly before <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, an amount of exotic radiation was found within the Negative Zone and held with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quantum-flask/18-55767/\">Quantum Flask</a>.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>After gathering several reports from various spies <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blastaar/29-10963/\">Blastaar</a>, who was recently appointed supreme ruler of The Negative Zone by Emperor <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a> of the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a>, and a massive army of Negative Zone inhabitants have stormed 42 and are preparing for a full-scale invasion of Earth. Peter Quill a.k.a. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starlord/29-10957/\">Star-Lord</a>, who was recently exiled to The Negative Zone by Ronan, is being forced to aid Blastaar in the attack on 42. Thanks to the timely assistance of <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">The Guardians of The Galaxy</a> along with the unregistered super-hero <a href=\"/jack-flag/29-25687/\">Jack Flag</a>; <a href=\"/starlord/29-10957/\">StarLord</a> was able to escape and warned <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a>, <a href=\"/gauntlet/29-42785/\">Gauntlet</a> and Baron Von Blitzschalg about Blastaar's armies.</p><p>The gates to 42 were shut down and The Negative Zone was sealed off from Earth-616. At the same time Blastaar turned 42 into his own personal fortress where he met with the last two surviving members of <a href=\"/the-fraternity-of-raptors/65-56355/\">The Fraternity of Raptors</a> - <a href=\"/talon/29-60703/\">Talon</a> and <a href=\"/darkhawk/29-2111/\">Razor</a> - who forged an alliance with Blastaar and as a sign of good faith gave him The <a href=\"/the-cosmic-control-rod/18-56037/\">Cosmic Control Rod</a>. One major problem has arisen however, due to lack of information transference, <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> knows nothing about Blastaar having taken control of 42 and following the capture of <a href=\"/hardball/29-42784/\">Hardball</a> has reopened the gates to 42.

        "description":"<p>To outsiders, Khera seems like a utopia, with its highly advanced technology, crime-free cities and fair government. In reality this is the furthest thing from the truth. Despite how things may have been in the past, present-day Khera is a planet populated by elitists. They live in a system that separates people by race, sex, species and type of superhuman ability. There are 3 types of being that are considered true Kherubim on Khera. The Pantheon (of which <a href=\"/mr-majestic/29-21972/\"> Mr. Majestic</a>, <a href=\"/mythos/29-21966/\"> Mythos</a>, <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\"> Spartan</a>, <a href=\"/imperator/29-40714/\"> Imperator</a>, <a href=\"/lord-entropy/29-40880/\"> Lord Entropy</a> and <a href=\"/emp/29-21970/\"> Emp</a> are members) consists of all males who possess a <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\"> Superman</a> power set. High ranking Pantheon members are also called \"Lords\" and are capable of becoming \"High Lords\". High Lords can abandon their physical bodies and ascend to a higher level of being. After the Pantheon there are males and females who are \"normal\" by Kheran standards. All their physical attributes are superhuman (though not nearly as high as that of Pantheon members) and they extremely long lived. The Coda (of which Zealot is a member) are the females who are trained from birth to be warriors. The Pantheon and the Coda make up the government of Khera and are usually in opposition. The Pantheon prefers to ignore their violence-filled past and strive for intellectual and scientific advances. The <a href=\"/coda/65-40958/\"> Coda</a> feels they should always be ready for war and actively looking to conquer others. In both groups there are Lords, beings with vast psychic powers and the ability to control energy. The last group is the Shaper\u2019s Guild. Genetically they are not true Kherubim but they are not considered different by the other two groups. The Shapers are all like <a href=\"/warblade/29-12014/\"> Warblade</a>; they can turn their bodies into liquid metal, shape it, and harden it into various bladed weapons as well as create projectiles. They are the architects and engineers of Khera. There is also a whole population of sentient robots like <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\"> Spartan</a> that are used for personal protection. The Titanthropes, or Titans, are the original race of Khera. They live underground and are used for heavy labor. <a href=\"/maul/29-21968/\"> Maul</a> was a Titan-human hybrid. They are treated unfairly by the \u201ctrue\u201d Kherubim and not considered as good as even the human-Kherubim hybrids, but they are not as bad off as the Daemonites. After the war, all Daemonites were made slaves. They are the lowest of society and live in the hidden ghettos of Khera.</p><p>Every Kherubim is a member of one of 7 military factions. They are called factions like membership is a choice, but membership is decided when a Kherubim is born and is connected to the type of being each Kherubim is. Members of the Kherubim Pantheon are Warlords that lead other Kherubim into battle and thanks to their amazing abilities can handle the biggest threats on their own. Not all Pantheon members are Warlords, but all Warlords come from the Pantheon. Warlords all all have a <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\"> Superman</a> power set and they are the \"most highly evolved members of the Kheran nobility\". The normal Kherubim are split into two groups, the Coda and the Brotherhood of the Blade. The Coda, as mentioned, are all female and the Brotherhood are all male. Other than sex, the two groups are basically the same but the Coda has more political power. Some members of the Brotherhood have taken to splicing Shaper DNA into their own to give themselves similar metallic-blade powers. The Titans are all Titanthropes and are used for their brute strength and massive size. The Shapers Guild and the Spartan Guards don't change at all from how it is when they are not in war. The last faction is the Adrastea. They are like the normal Kherubim but they all have psychic powers (many are empaths). The group was originally a slave caste but became a powerful underground criminal organization.</p><p>In <a href=\"/majestic/49-18002/\"> Majestic</a>, Mr. Majestic's second solo series, the true history of Khera and the Kherubim was revealed. The original Kherubim came from somewhere else a long time ago and the Kherubim race that exists now are just copies, made and distributed through space thanks to <a href=\"/kherubim-technology/12-41622/\"> Kherubim Technology</a>. The first Kherubim created Planet-Shapers, massive terraforming machines that could be sent to suitable planets and through a long process, would rebuild the Kherubim race there. The Planet-Shapers would land on a still-forming planet and stay dormant beneath the mantle until sentient life evolved on the planet. At this point, the Planet-Shaper would release Kherubim (made inside the machine from \"pure Kherubim gene-stock\" it carried) and the natural sentient race of the planet would be made into a servitor race. To ensure that the new Kherubim flourished, the Planet-Shapers would restructure climate and geographic conditions to best suit the Kherubim. Also, giant robots would come from the Planet-Shapers and kill most of the servitor race, thinning down their numbers so they would never pose a threat to the new Kherubim. Sometimes the native sentient race was considered \"unusable or deviant\" and therefore had to be destroyed. The <a href=\"/daemonites/65-41061/\"> Daemonites</a> (the Kherubim's worst enemy) are just a slave species that were able to fight back, not actually evil creatures. The only people that know this secret history are <a href=\"/mr-majestic/29-21972/\"> Mr. Majestic</a>, <a href=\"/zealot/29-11586/\"> Zealot</a> and <a href=\"/helspont/29-40632/\"> Helspont</a>.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Keystone City is the city, in which the <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, the Fastest Man Alive, resides.</p><h2>Location, History, and Culture</h2><p>Like <a href=\"/gotham-city/34-23611/\">Gotham City</a> (home to <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>), <a href=\"/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a> (<a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>'s turf), and <a href=\"/star-city/34-47878/\">Star City</a> (<a href=\"/green-arrow/29-5936/\">Green Arrow</a>'s stomping grounds), Keystone City is home to a superhero - the Scarlet Speedster. However, it is different in a large way. Instead of being dark, like Gotham, or huge, like <a href=\"/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a>, Keystone City is a small blue-collar town. Keystone City is in <a href=\"/kansas/34-55854/\">Kansas</a> on the Kansas-<a href=\"/missouri/34-55752/\">Missouri</a> border. Keystone City is approximately 35 miles north of Kansas City. The Missouri River separates Keystone City from its sister city, <a href=\"/central-city/34-54995/\">Central City</a>, Missouri.</p><p>Keystone City is near a few landmarks, such a<a href=\"/iron-heights/34-41410/\">s Iron Heights</a>. Iron Heights is a supervillain prison that is specially used for <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>'s villains.</p><p>After the Louisiana Purchase, a small settlement was created near the Missouri River in 1806. Following the Civil War. Keystone City became a supply center, as most business dealt with heavy industry. The transcontinental railroad through the city caused it to become a major transportation hub, from which the city could manufacture and distribute its industrial products. During World War II, the city retooled for the war effort, manufacturing aircraft and supplies for the huge war waged against the Axis.</p><p>Keystone City has been described as the blue-collar capital of America. \u201cKeystone City, the backbone of the Midwest. When the town was established in 1727, horseshoeing was the major occupation. Times change. Iron and steel forging, automobiles, coal, machinery tools, all of them come from this city.... The blue-collar capital of the U.S. and proud of it... It\u2019s a tough place, but a good place. With honest people who aren\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty.\u201d This quote describes the place perfectly-it's a tough, friendly poor town full of hard-working people. Keystone is a huge center of manufacturing goods and supplies, too-supplies include iron, cars, and heavy machinery. The union is also huge, as the workers have combined to form one of the biggest unions in America.</p><h3>Flashes</h3><p>The first <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a>, was the first and longest staying in Keystone City. He was introduced in 1940, and was in Keystone from the start. He fought villains like <a href=\"/thinker/29-23851/\">Thinker</a>, <a href=\"/shade/29-9362/\">Shade</a>, <a href=\"/fiddler/29-6900/\">Fiddler</a>, and the especially evil <a href=\"/turtle/29-5721/\">Turtle</a>. Eventually, though, after ten years, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a> retired as Flash. This gave <a href=\"/turtle/29-5721/\">Turtle</a> an opportunity, and he built a criminal empire in Keystone that flourished for years. However, the third <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a> (<a href=\"/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a>) arrived and brought <a href=\"/turtle/29-5721/\">Turtle</a>'s empire down. Barry Allen and Bart Allen, the other two <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>es, never have resided in Keystone City.</p><h2>Continuity Crisis</h2><p>Originally, in Pre-Crisis history, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a> lived and fought villains from his base residence in Keystone City before retiring at a historical period when comics started to fall out of popularity. But when DC introduced the Barry Allen <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, starting the Silver Age, it was said that Allen lived in Central City-which had never been mentioned Pre-Crisis. DC's initial solution was oft-used before 1986--DC writers set Barry Allen's Central City on another Earth. It was noted that Keystone City was on Earth-2 with Garrick, while Central City was the Earth-1 home of Barry Allen. However, DC pulled all of the universes together in the universe-altering <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>, which bound all the universes together. DC covered the problem by making the two sister cities across from each other, while keeping each <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a> in his respective city.</p><p>Right now, the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> event has sucked both the <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>es that were in Keystone City into the <a href=\"/speed-force/12-42071/\">Speed Force</a>. What is Keystone's future without a Flash to protect them? We'll have to wait and see.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview&nbsp;</h2><p>Genosha used to be a hellish place on the Earth. It was nice for a short amount of time, and it was then reduced back to a hellish place. Only through a lot of work and perseverance will it stand tall-and it won't be easy.</p><h2>Genosha</h2><p>For most of Genosha's time, it was an island off the African coast. Its capital was Hammer Bay. At a glance, it seemed to be a good, prosperous nation. The standard of living was high and the citizens were well-treated. The economy was excellent and growing all the time. Political or racial turmoil was non-existent. Good things seemed to be happening in little Genosha. But all these things only applied for the humans of this small, inconspicuous, seemingly unimportant island nation.</p><p>In Genosha, the mutant population was enslaved. David Moreau, a scientist was known as the Genengineer. Anyone with the mutant gene was forced through a horrific treatment developed by the Genengineer. They were genetically modified and enhanced for their powers, and stripped of free will. They were treated like animals and given numbers, identified by those numbers. Their powers were changed to fit the needs of the economy. Then they were shipped off and worked as slaves until they died. No one was allowed in or out of Genosha. If you are a citizen, you will stay a citizen until you die. If you are not a citizen, then you're not getting in Genosha. The <a href=\"/genoshan-magistrates/65-25418/\">Magistrates</a> were a special police force that tracked down people who tried to escape and brought them back forcibly, and the Press Gang handled mutant problems. All in all, it was a horrible place.</p><p>The island of Genosha was often an enemy of the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> and other teams in the <a href=\"/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> (including <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a>, <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a>, and <a href=\"/generation-x/65-15083/\">Generation X</a>). Since mutants are horribly treated there, they often go to rescue the poor people, and Magistrates often attack them to bring them into Genosha, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, and <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> were kidnapped by Magistrates under the orders of the Genengineer and <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/29-13379/\">Cameron Hodge</a>. Hodge used to be an ally of X-Factor, but he became a mutant hater. They were rescued, though. Later, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a> and <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> were kidnapped and going to brainwashed to be Genoshan \"citizens\". The X-Men freed their compatriots and toppled the Hodge and the Gengineer's regime. The new government promised kindness and humane treating of mutants, but spurred on by the <a href=\"/fabian-cortez/29-9728/\">Fabian Cortez</a>, Civil War broke out between the Mutates and Magistrate forces.</p><h2>Magneto's Regime and the Fall of Genosha</h2><p>After Cassasndra Nova's Attack</p><p>Playing on his reputation, <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> made his last blackmail attempt on the world threatening to destroy planetary EM field if he was not granted territory to create a mutant homeland. Despite the efforts of the X-Men to stop him, including the ultimate sacrifice of Magneto's clone <a href=\"/joseph/29-15063/\">Joseph</a>, the U.N. granted Magneto Genosha. The island nation had been torn apart by civil war between the Magistrate regime and the Mutate rebellion for months (perhaps years) and the U.N. hoped Magneto would be so bogged down in fighting this war, the Legacy Virus sweeping through the population, and Genosha's failed economy that he would never trouble the world again.</p><p>They were wrong. Within six months, Magneto had led the mutants and mutates to victory, and the Legacy Virus was cured. Magneto quickly rebuilt Genosha into a prosperous mutant paradise. Overconfident, Magneto declared war on humanity again. The X-Men snuck into Genosha to intervene and in the course of battle, Magneto's spine was severed by Wolverine. As Magneto's powers are dependent on his nervous system being intact, this not only left him paralyzed but unable to use his powers. This event would end up costing millions of lives.</p><p>In revenge for Xavier's mistreatment of her, <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a> found the last living relative of <a href=\"/bolivar-trask/29-15923/\">Bolivar Trask</a>, who had created the <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>. She then convinced him to give her control over the Sentinels. She sent them them to Genosha where they began wiping out the population. Depowered, Magneto was unable to stop them. The entire island was reduced to a pile of rubble, and all the progress was lost. 16 million people were killed, leaving perhaps a couple hundred survivors. Nova was eventually defeated by the X-Men back in New York, but the damage was done.</p><p>Magneto and <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> joined forces to reform Genosha, but their work was interrupted by the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>'s nervous breakdown and the events of House of M. In the world of House of M, Geonsha was Magneto's seat of powers, and therefore the most prosperous nation in the world. However, when Wanda revered the world to normal, not only was Genosha restored to it's decimated state, but her entire mutant population, including its leader, was turned into normal humans. <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> eventually removed the last of the Genosha population for medical treatment, but Magneto remained. When they attempted to remove an unconscious Magneto from Genosha after his and the Avenger's encounter with the Collective, Magneto escaped. He has most recently been seen roaming the United States, seemingly depowered.</p><p>The most recent visitors to Genosha were Magneto's grandchildren: <a href=\"/wiccan/29-40505/\">Wiccan</a> and <a href=\"/speed/29-40518/\">Speed</a>, looking for their mother the Scarlet Witch. They encountered an empty land filled with destroyed towers and empty streets.</p><p>\"No one is here.\"</p><p>Whether Magneto retains legal possession of Genosha is unknown.</p><h2>Necrosha</h2><p>Selene's plans involve resurrecting the millions of dead mutants on the island and to make it the start of her kingdom.</p><h2>X-Factor Forever</h2><p>Through unknown means <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a> managed to convince <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">The Celestials</a> that Genosha was a threat to Mutantkind much like <a href=\"/deviants/65-13345/\">The Deviants</a> had been a threat to Humankind and so, like <a href=\"/lemuria/34-55791/\">Lemuria</a> before it, Genosha was obliterated by <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/29-32857/\">Arishem the Judge</a> and his Host. While much of its population managed to escape, not all of Genosha's inhabitants were fortunate enough to escape the wrath of their Celestial creators.</p><h2>Ultimate Genosha</h2><p>Ultimate Genosha is a small island south of Madagascar. It mostly does television programs, and the Ultimate versions of <a href=\"/longshot/29-6757/\">Longshot</a> and <a href=\"/mojo/29-6755/\">Mojo</a> live there. It seems to be crossed between Earth-616 Genosha and the Mojoworld, as mutants are only second-class citizens there.</p>",

Asgard is not a sphere-like shape, but a piece of land that floats in space. Asgard also doesn't rotate on an axis nor does it rotate around the sun, though there may be an object of some sort that gives it its sunlight. Gravity is similarly like Earth, although heavier. For example, a chair made of wood would be considerably heavier than one on Earth. What keeps the land together is unknown, but it keeps it together. Water doesn't pour from the land, as the gravity keeps it there as well.</p><p>Asgard itself is connected to nine other dimensions which form the nine worlds of <a href=\"/asgardian-gods/65-41205/\">Asgardian</a> cosmology through naturally occurring dimensional portals. Sometimes the nine different worlds have been treated as the same dimension with Midgard (Earth) being separate.</p><h2>Creation</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"300911\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/300911-152095-asgard.jpg\" title=\"Heimdall guarding the Bifrost Bridge\"><img id=\"300911\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/300911-152095-asgard_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Heimdall guarding the Bifrost Bridge\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heimdall guarding the Bifrost Bridge</div></div></div></div><p>Asgard's true origin is unknown due to the cycle of Ragnaroks. According to one story, originally there was a void, Ginnungagap, bounded on either side by fire Muspelheim, the land of fire and Niflheim, the land of ice. When fire and ice met, they combined to form a giant named <a href=\"/ymir/29-10267/\">Ymir</a> and a cow named Audhumbla who nourished Ymir. She survived by licking the salty ice blocks. From her licking emerged <a href=\"/tiwaz/29-29073/\">Buri</a> who fathered <a href=\"/bor/29-58894/\">Bor</a> and through him the Asgardian race. Bor took the frost giant Bestia as his wife and fathered three children: <a href=\"/odin/29-3507/\">Odin</a>, Vili, and Ve. Bor is attributed with founding the city of Asgard and being its first king. The three brothers eventually slew Ymir and from his body made the Earth and humanity. After Bor's disappearance and the deaths of his brothers in battle with Surtur Odin became the sole ruler of the gods.</p><p>Another version states Asgard as it exist now only came into being about two thousand years ago. Every few thousand years Asgard is destroyed in Ragnarok only for a new Odin to form, rebuild the city and start the cycle anew with the gods living similar lives as they did before with slight differences. This cycle was perpetuated by mysterious beings called <a href=\"/those-who-sit-above-in-shadow/65-56155/\">Those Who Sit Above in Shadow</a> so they could feed off the energy released before being broken by Thor.</p><p>Another version given recently by Odin states when Odin and his brothers were children Bor took a seed from a dimensional rift and planted it in the ground creating the World Tree. It is unknown if this merely connected the nine worlds, created all of them including Asgard, or some combination.</p><p>Another version suggest the beings who became known as the Norse gods were formed from the \"godstuff\" scattered by <a href=\"/atum-the-god-eater/29-41842/\">Atum</a> the God-Eater after he slew the evil elder gods. This godstuff was shaped by early human perceptions which formed all modern pantheons. The gods then eventually travelled from Earth to the dimension that became known as Asgard.</p><p>Another version suggest the gods were originally tribes of mortals that somehow ascended to godhood and eventually moved to Asgard.</p><p>It is unknown to what extent any of these stories are true. It is possible several of them are true or bits and pieces from various ones from the true origin. It is also possible none of them are true.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1116869\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/59489/1116869-thor601.jpg\" title=\"Thor with Asgard in the background\"><img id=\"1116869\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/59489/1116869-thor601_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Thor with Asgard in the background\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Thor with Asgard in the background</div></div></div></div><p>Whatever the original beginnings, Odin's desire to lead Asgard led him to betray his father during a battle with frost giants. With Bor turned to snow then scattered by the winds and his brothers fallen in battle with Surtur, Odin became the High Father of Asgard. As the years passed, Odin's wisdom grew stronger and he sought to understand more of the universe beyond the nine worlds. His curiosity lead to war with the <a href=\"/dark-gods/65-23162/\">Dark Gods</a>, a pantheon of alien gods that were Asgard's opposite in ever way that mattered. War broke out between them and Asgard fell for the first time. After Thor aided his father in battle, Odin retook Asgard and banished the Dark Gods. Centuries passed and Asgard fell victim to Sutur of Muspelhiem, and in a final battle, Odin and Sutur were killed in battle and Asgard fell once again. However, they both returned alive and Odin return to rule the kingdom.</p><p>Odin learned of the cycle of Ragnarok and kept it secret from his people. At one point, the Egyptian god, Seth sought to destroy Asgard and with Thor lost in Onslaught, he saw it as the perfect time to claim Asgard and end the cycle to reshape the kingdom to his rule. However, the Asgardians rose and stopped Seth but in their weaken state, the Dark Gods returned and destroyed Asgard to reshape in their own image. Eventually, Thor returned and freed his people and Asgard returned to its wondrous state again. However, those times grew dark again as Surtur returned to Earth and Odin was once again lost and Thor took over as ruler. Thor moved Asgard to Earth and attempted to better life for all humans, but due to Resistance from without and treachery from within eventually subjugated the Earth to his rule. In time, he was force to face his crimes and returning to the past prevented that timeline from ever coming about. His actions during this caused the <a href=\"/the-odin-force/12-35070/\">Odinforce</a> to leave him making Asgard vulnerable. In was during this time that <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> started Ragnarok and sought to reshape Asgard in his own way. He devastated Asgard until Thor had discovered the truth and used the powers of the Rune Stones to end Loki's rule and break the endless cycle of Those who Sit above in Shadow for good.</p><h2>Attractions</h2><ul><li>Dome of Combat</li><li>Giant Bust of Odin</li><li>Hall of Heroes</li><li>Monument to the Unknown Warrior</li><li>Museum of Weaponry</li><li>Shopping Center</li><li>Temple of Titans</li><li>Warlock's Haven</li><li>Warrior's Walk</li><li>Yggasdral (Tree of Life) Monument</li></ul><h2>Post Destruction</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1051324\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38888/1051324-9027445_550_art_r0.jpg\" title=\"Fall of Asgard\"><img id=\"1051324\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38888/1051324-9027445_550_art_r0_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fall of Asgard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fall of Asgard</div></div></div></div><p>After the destruction of Asgard and the Civil War had concluded <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> returned from the dead. Choosing an appropriate spot in the Oklahoma desert Thor re-created the city of Asgard exactly as it was before Ragnarok. When the farmer that owned the barren land resented Thor putting a mystical land above the land he owned Thor offered to purchase the land, allowing him to enter Asgard's vaults and take whatever price that he deemed the land worth from the treasure stores. Asgard currently hovers above this spot in the Oklahoma desert.</p><p>During <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siege/39-55985/\">Siege</a>, Asgard was invaded by Norman Osborn and the majority of his forces.

In 1939,Loki, posing as Baron Zemo, made an alliance with the Frost Giants who laid siege to Asgard, intending to cause Ragnarok, the end of all things.

The leader of the <a href=\"/frost-giants/65-57102/\">Frost Giants</a>, Mammoth killed Odin, Thor in despair over his fathers death and his brothers betrayal, used Mjolnir to destroy Asgard, along with the Frost Giants and the rest of the Asgardians. As he was confined to the room without doors, Loki was the only Asgardian god to survive the destruction of Asgard. Thor and Balder were reborn as humans on Earth in the late 20th century. During the events of Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates, Thor was killed, and reborn as an Asgardian, shortly after this in Ultimate Comics: Fallout, Asgard was recreated in the skies above Europe, as part of Odin's greater plan to remake two worlds, Asgard into what it once was, and Earth into what it can be. Asgard was destroyed in Ultimate Comics: Ultimates issue 2, by Reed Richards and the <a href=\"/children-of-tomorrow/65-58814/\">children of tomorrow</a>.

        "description":"<p>The 1950s were a difficult time for the United States.  Post-war internationalism coupled with a fear of Communism's spread forced the American government to go to extreme measures to protect itself.  One of these measures was Science City Zero.</p><p>Located somewhere in the American Southwest, Science City Zero was a top-secret research installation.  Human subjects were brought in - usually political dissidents, reactionaries, vagrants, drinkers and, well, anyone who was generally disapproved of - and used to test the limits of biotechnology and the human body.</p><p>Subjects were rendered invisible, grown to giant sizes, had their brains replaced with energy fields, and resurrected from the dead, for starters.  The grounds were patrolled by atomic dogs and giant ants, and getting out was nearly impossible.</p><p>The lead scientist in Science City Zero was <a href=\"/randall-dowling/29-1821/\">Randall Dowling</a>, one of the greatest scientist of the time, who had an obsession with metahumans.  He was not one himself, but aspired to it, a personality flaw that would eventually make him one of the most powerful people on the planet.  His work was backed not only by the U.S. Government, but also by private concerns, the Hark Corporation being chief among them.</p><p>By the end of the decade, unable to sustain such atrocity, Science City Zero was shut down and quickly evacuated.  Much of the equipment and research were left behind, but undiscovered until the site was investigated by <a href=\"/planetary/65-40401/\">Planetary</a> on a tip from a young woman named <a href=\"/allison/29-17597/\">Allison</a>, who had been a subject there.</p><p>Some subjects left Science City Zero alive, but changed.  Some developed metahuman abilities, and passed those on to their children.  One such child was <a href=\"/ambrose-chase/29-17591/\">Ambrose Chase</a> of Planetary, who could bend the laws of physics in his vicinity.  Other descendants of Science City Zero were recruited by <a href=\"/jim-wilder/29-17588/\">Jim Wilder</a> to serve as the crew of a long-buried Bleed-ship.</p><p>Though the facility is long abandoned, its legacy is far from finished.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Marvel Comics</h2><p>Marvel's version of Atlantis first appeared in Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1, in April 1939 , but it wasn't named Atlantis until the October 1963 issue of Fantastic Four Annual #1. In the Marvel universe, Atlantis is a the city under the sea ruled by <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor, the Sub-Mariner</a>.</p><p>It was originally a small continent with human settlements but this all changed 21,000 years ago during an event known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-great-cataclysm/12-55772/\">the Great Cataclysm</a> and it was swallowed by the depths of the sea. This event was caused by <a href=\"/king-kamuu/29-36921/\">King Kamuu</a> when he tried to defend it from the Deviants of Lemuria by opening the city's magma pits. Several settlements survived including Atlantis and Netheria, as they had built a glass dome to shield each before this catastrophe took place.</p><p>Sole survivors included such beings as <a href=\"/varnae/29-13785/\">Varnae</a>, Stygyro and Dakhimh the Enchanter. But it was only 13,000 years later than the city of Atlantis was re inhabited, as it was discovered by some Homo Merman's who made it their first mighty city, and becoming the Atlanteans.</p><p>After 500 years living in Atlantis another city was rebuilt, <a href=\"/lemuria/34-55791/\">Lemuria</a>, by Atlanteans who left Atlantis. And so it was that the <a href=\"/lemurians/65-36925/\">Lemurians</a> differed from their former people when they discovered the Serpent Crown in their ruins and they began to develop a more serpentine appearance.</p><p>Homo Sapiens and Homo Mermanus have interacted several times, usually with hostility as the Homo Mermanus have invaded the surface world multiple times. Though the current ruler of Atlantis, Prince Namor fought against the Axis Powers in World War II.</p><p>In modern times, the <a href=\"/the-peak-old-atlantis/34-57336/\">Old Kingdom of Atlantis</a> revealed itself and claimed rule to all of the sea. Namor went to war with them, but the war was stopped as soon as it began when the Invisible Woman became its ruler.</p><h2>DC Comics</h2><p>DC's version of Atlantis first appeared in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/49-3105/\">Adventure Comics</a> vol 1 #260 in 1959.</p><p>In the DC universe, Atlantis is a the city under the sea ruled by <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a>.</p><h3><b>History</b></h3><p>The Kingdom of Atlantis is generally considered to be the earliest known civilization on Earth, existing as long as 1,000,000 years ago. How the Atlantean race of homo sapiens arose hundreds of thousands of years before the rise of current-day humanity is unknown, but this anomaly of evolution is believed to be linked to the strong presence of magical energy, or mana, that then existed around Earth.</p><p>The original Atlanteans were highly mystical beings; their society and the very structure of the world was based on the use of this magical energy. Over the millennia, the mana was eventually depleted, and the powers of science and technology replaced sorcery as the dominant force of nature.</p><p>While it flourished, Atlantis was a great civilization; it ruled the world through the power of its twelve major city-states, which were located on all the continents of Earth. Each of these city-states was ruled by a sorcerer-monarch who wielded the mystic power of his part of the world. At the head of the entire Atlantean Empire was the most powerful kings and queens. Less the master of the eleven other monarchs than a sort of chairman of the Royal Conclave of Twelve, this monarch also reigned over the first and largest of the Atlantean city-states, the magnificent City of the Golden Gate.</p><p>In its early years however, Atlantis was ruled by a body of mad sorcerers. These sorcerers were eventually wiped out and replaced by saner rulers who sought peace rather than the the endless warfare of their predecessors. Atlantis' first great era of peace and prosperity came during the reign of Calculha, about half a million years ago. To Calculha and his queen Majiestra were born two sons, Ahri'ahn and Garn. Majiestra was a student of the dark forces, and in seeking power, she stole the Twelve Crystals of the Zodiac, which were keyed to the magical nexi of the twelve major cities. To save Atlantis from her evil Ahri'ahn sacrificed himself. His soul was sent out into the stars in the form of pure magical energy, where it traveled for hundreds of thousands of years before being drawn back to Earth for its rebirth as Arion.</p><p>The Atlanteans grew in stature and power. Soon, their eyes turned to the world beyond Earth, leading them to begin an extensive study and survey of the universe. These efforts culminated in the creation of magically-fueled spacecraft, which carried hordes of Atlantean colonists out into interstellar space, they lost contact with Earth. Years later, it was learned that the farther they traveled away from Earth, the weaker the magic that propelled their ships became. The Atlanteans found refuge on an uninhabited world and created a civilization based on science. Technology-powered space flight was eventually rediscovered and the Atlanteans, having evolved along different biological and ethical paths, set out on a warlike conquest of neighboring worlds.</p><p>Although the Atlanteans were virtually the all-powerful masters of the world and their environment, they were confronted with certain insurmountable problems. Foremost among these problems was the disappearance of the magical mana. Also, the Atlanteans encountered a savage race of barbaric sub-men, Homo Erectus, which were the precursors to our own civilization. The people of Atlantis also shared the Earth with a variety of magical beings and creatures, as well as otherdimensional visitors from neighboring mystically-based realms.</p><p>As the magic waned, Atlantis' hold over the Earth began to weaken as all of the Atlanteans' energies were focused on maintaining their hold on existence. Cities built on magic crumbled, and the creatures of sorcerous origins lapsed into extinction and myth. Arion had returned during this era and attempted to gold his world together, but the forces of change were to great for even his magic, and the great civilization that was Atlantis crumbled.</p><p>The kingdom of Atlantis held on for several years after that, with Arion at it's helm, before the final fall and the Atlanteans' virtual extinction at the hands of the barbarous hordes of emerging mankind. Before this, Lord Norrad the Younger fled Atlantis with a small group of followers. They eventually sailed through the interdimensional nexus linking the Earth and Skartaris.</p><h3>Cities of Atlantis</h3><p>Atlantis has split into several different cities since its sinking. The main of these being <b>Poseidonis</b>, the domed city where <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a> is seen most often, but there are many more.</p><p><b>Poseidonis</b></p><p>The main city of Atlantis, it is a large domed city. <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a> is seen here most often.

It has been rebuilt now.</p><p><b>Tritonis</b></p><p>A land of rough living mermen and women that view their way of life (living with the creatures of the deep) clean and natural, feeling it makes them stronger. This was the home of the Merman <a href=\"/king-iqula/29-24190/\">King Iqula</a>, whom challenged and nearly defeated Aquaman. After being defeated in a one-on-one battle with Aquaman he swore to help protect Poseidonis as best he can.</p><p><b>Thierna Na Oge</b></p><p>A land of mystics that are ruled by a mystical Conclave.</p><p><b>Shayeris (formerly Crastnus)</b></p><p>The Capital of the Hidden Valley. Home to extremely secluded mystics and pacifists. The birthplace of <a href=\"/tempest/29-2382/\">Garth</a> the first <a href=\"/aqualad/29-71494/\">Aqualad</a>.</p><p><b><a href=\"/xebel/34-57137/\">Xebel</a></b></p><p>Xebel is a penal colony locked beneath the <a href=\"/bermuda-triangle/34-56177/\">Bermuda Triangle</a>, <a href=\"/mera/29-14654/\">Mera</a> is from here.

It's unclear how she and the soldiers managed to get out of their imprisonment.</p><p><b><a href=\"/sub-diego/34-57025/\">Sub Diego</a></b></p><p>Sub Diego was a portion of <a href=\"/san-diego/34-57051/\">San Diego</a> that sunk into the sea, and became part of the kingdom of Atlantis.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2>A Utopian paradise that had eliminated all forms of disease, poverty, and hardship from their society, Zenn-La was the first planet selected by Galactus to provide him with sustenance that he spared due to Norrin Radd's agreement to become his herald, the Silver Surfer.<br /><br /><h2>Location</h2>Zenn-La is located in the Cygnus constellation. It is the fourth planet of thirty-seven revolving around the star Deneb. The planet rotates faster than Earth causing shorter days.<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Religion<br /></h2>&nbsp;In the distant past the Zenn-Lavians worshiped several pantheons of gods that are now known as the <a href=\"/old-gods-of-zenn-la/65-57918/\">   Old Gods of Zenn-La</a>.&nbsp; <a href=\"/thrann/29-74519/\">  Thrann</a>, the Saint of Science taught them to embrace science ironically bringing an end to the worship of the gods despite their attempt to reconnect.&nbsp; The Zenn-Lavians turning their backs on the gods led the gods to turn their backs on them even in the face of disaster.<br /><br /><h2>History</h2> <h3>From Chaos to Enlightenment</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873159\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873159-norrin_konn_super.jpg\" title=\"Norrin Konn - Father of Zenn-La\"><img id=\"873159\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873159-norrin_konn_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Norrin Konn - Father of Zenn-La\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Norrin Konn - Father of Zenn-La</div></div></div></div>Originally, <a href=\"/zenn-lavians/65-57886/\">    Zenn-Lavians</a> were full of lust and hate. Once some realized that they would eventually exterminate themselves in a few generations, they turned to science.&nbsp; The god <a href=\"/thrann/29-74519/\"> Thrann </a>is credited with bringing about this change.&nbsp; Some would not follow the path of the rationality and logic and civil war broke out on the planet. The technological side was led by <a href=\"/norrin-konn/29-77391/\">Norrin Konn</a> and the people that wished to follow the old ways was led by a female <a href=\"/warlord-of-zenn-la/29-63415/\">             Warlord</a>. The Warlord was eventually defeated and Zenn-La came to be in a technological, enlightened era.<br /><br />Zenn-La became a supremely technologically advanced world. Marvels in science made it so no Zenn-Lavian need ever dirty their hands. Everything was controlled by computers and robots. Zenn-Lavians had a peaceful utopia with no need for war or violence. Before this time though, Zenn-Lavians waged war on each other for ten thousand centuries, as do most civilizations. This ended and the Zenn-Lavians began to explore space but eventually their technology advanced so much that this became an old practice.<br /><br />This advanced society became bored with having nothing to do. Some people resorted to drugs to send them into mind-altering adventures. Others used psycho-recreational arts, a form of leisure device that transfers dreams into one's mind. Others still could not bare this type of life and committed suicide. Some believed the the advances in science were wasting the people away from their prior greatness.<br /><br />When Galactus' spaceship approached the planet, the Zenn-Lavians being a peaceful race they were defenseless. The people panicked, and in desperation they used a museum piece, the last remaining weapon on Zenn-La. They called it the Supreme Weapon and fired it at the ship. It was so destructive it knocked nearby planets from their orbits and created worldwide destruction. Zenn-La itself only survived because of it's force field. Zenn-La was to be consumed by <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">             Galactus</a> but Norrin Radd gave himself to the being in exchange for the safety of his people. He thus became the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">             Silver Surfer</a>.<br /><br /><h3>Destruction and Rebirth</h3>When the Surfer rebelled against his master he imprisoned him on Earth and returned to Zenn-La, consuming it's energy. In a rare moment, Galactus gave the residents of the planet 24 hours to escape. The planet was left barren but the Zenn-Lavians survived. After the heat and smoke settled, they returned and created large camps to live in. The planet remained barren with only weeds growing from the soil. <br /><br />When <a href=\"/mephisto/29-2635/\">             Mephisto</a> brought <a href=\"/shalla-bal/29-7125/\">             Shalla Bal</a>, Norrin's long lost love, to Earth only to take her away to torment the Surfer he was able to give her some of his <a href=\"/power-cosmic/12-41039/\">             Power Cosmic</a>. With this power she was able to start growth on the dead planet wherever she stepped foot. Because of this power she was named Empress of Zenn-La. They began to rebuild and with their technologic expertise they were able to quickly rebuilt their society.<br /><br /><h3>Kree-Skrull War</h3>Zenn-La was threatened to be in the middle of the Second Kree-Skrull War. When the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">             Skrulls </a>approached the planet to make it an ally the Silver Surfer turned them away. He vowed to Shall Bal to be protector of the planet. When the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">             Kree </a>came to recruit them the Surfer destroyed their ships. Later in a meeting with <a href=\"/nenora/29-56642/\">             Nenora</a>, Supreme Leader of the Kree Empire, she agreed to leave the planet out of the war.<br /><br />After helping to save Galactus' life from the <a href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/65-41142/\">             Elders of the Universe</a>, Galactus has agreed to never devour Zenn-La ever again.<br /><br />The planet's population was then attacked by the <a href=\"/obliterator/29-45074/\">             Obliterator</a>, who decimated the population. He threatened to destroy the entire planet. Silver Surfer managed to lure him away.<br /><br />The planet was again attacked by the Kree Empire after a misunderstanding between Supreme Leader Nenora and the Silver Surfer. Zenn-La allies with the Skrulls against the common enemy. Again, the Surfer managed to persuade her to leave the planet out of the war. She tells him though that the empire will hunt him wherever he goes and he is not to return to the planet. By the end of the war, the Surfer had no obligations to hold up this agreement. With the Kree defeated, the Empress witnessed the truce between the waring races. But this was only temporary and the planet was still at risk. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>The Enslavers </h3>The entire race of the Zenn-Lavians was captured by the <a href=\"/enslavers/65-56863/\">            Enslavers</a>, and they left no trace of what happened. The Silver Surfer consulted <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">           Mr. Fantastic</a> on Earth and decided he should search harder. He was eventually led to the Enslavers ship and their ruler <a href=\"/mrrungo-mu/29-64819/\">          Mrrungo-Mu</a>. He was able to defeat Mrrungo and free all of his captors, including the Zenn-Lavians. Along with Shalla Bal, he returned them back to their planet.<br /><br /><h3>&nbsp;A Chance for Peace</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873182\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873182-great_one_on_zenn_la_super.jpg\" title=\"The Great One\"><img id=\"873182\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873182-great_one_on_zenn_la_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Great One\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Great One</div></div></div></div>Zenn-La was then met by the <a href=\"/great-one/29-42978/\">             Great One</a>, who preserved worlds in his own mind. He gave the people the choice to leave the universe behind and be protected forever. They unanimously voted to stay with the Great One. Inside his mind, all Zenn-Lavians were made immortal and lived&nbsp; peaceful, happy lives. The Silver Surfer even returned with the help of <a href=\"/moondragon/29-7214/\">             Moondragon </a>and lived in peace for the first time since meeting Galactus. But out of fear, the Great One attacked him and received a mortal wound. If he were to die then so would Zenn-La. With the help of Moondragon, he was able to rescue the planet from destruction, but not before losing Empress Shalla Bal in the process. The citizens blamed the loss of both the Great One's protection and their Empress on the Silver Surfer.<br /><br /><h3>Return of the Empress</h3>With the help of Adam Warlock, the Silver Surfer was able to resurrect Shalla and she once again returned to be the Empress of Zenn-La. It was here that she met <a href=\"/fennan-radd/29-7127/\">             Fennan Radd</a> and formed a relationship with him. He believed the people to be falling into irresponsibility and laziness due to the level of advancement their society had achieved and their Silver Surfer worship. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>All An Illusion </h3>The Silver Surfer was alerted that their was trouble on Zenn-La and rushed there to see the planet falling apart. The current <a href=\"/genis-vell/29-4813/\">      Captain Marvel</a> was trying to stop the source, but the Surfer stopped him. They watched as the planet just evaporated into thin air. The Surfer lost his emotions and certain memories after this. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Surfer went back in time to unlock his emotions and memories and discovered the truth. Zenn-La was destroyed in the Earth year 1947 by <a href=\"/the-other/65-56848/\">     The Other</a>. Galactus knew one day his herald would leave him and return home, so he created an illusion so lifelike that no one would ever know.<br /> <b><br /></b><h2>Zenn-Lavian People</h2><b>Origin Galaxy:</b> Milky Way<br /><b>Star System:</b> Deneb<br /><b>Planet:</b> Zenn-La, 4th from the sun<br /><b>Estimated Population:</b> 500<br /><b>Physical Characteristics:</b><br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Type:</b> Humanoid</li><li><b>Eyes: </b>Two</li><li><b>Fingers:</b> Five, with opposable thumb</li><li><b>Toes:</b> Five</li><li><b>Skin Color: </b>Pink</li><li><b>Average Height:</b> 6'0''</li></ul><b>Special Adaptations:</b> Zenn-Lavians have average lifespans of thousands of years<br /><b>Level of Technology:</b> Advanced<br /><b>Type of Government: </b>Utopia<br /><b>Names of Representatives: </b><a href=\"/yarro-gort/29-14620/\">             Yarro Gort</a>, <a href=\"/norrin-konn/29-77391/\">Norrin Konn</a>, <a href=\"/elmar-radd/29-59878/\">             Elmar Radd</a>, <a href=\"/jartran-radd/29-57409/\">             Jartran Radd</a>, <a href=\"/fennan-radd/29-7127/\">             Fennan Radd</a>, <a href=\"/shalla-bal/29-7125/\">             Shalla Bal</a>, <a href=\"/warlord-of-zenn-la/29-63415/\">             Warlord</a>, <a href=\"/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">             Norrin Radd</a>, Anddar Bal <br />&nbsp;<br />Called Zenn-Lans in some later stories.<br /><br /><h2>Places of Interest</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873151\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873151-zenn_la_city_super.jpg\" title=\"Zenn-La City\"><img id=\"873151\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873151-zenn_la_city_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Zenn-La City\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zenn-La City</div></div></div></div>The City of Zenn-La - The first city to give itself over to technology before the civil war.

They are very fond of their children, calling them \"our kings and queens.\"  Any crimes committed by outsiders were usually punished less harshly than those by citizens, on the grounds that the outsiders don't know any better.</p><p>This was fortunate for people such as <a href=\"/elijah-snow/29-1819/\">Elijah Snow</a> and <a href=\"/lord-blackstock/29-17586/\">Lord Blackstock</a>.</p><p>Blackstock was a well-known visitor to Opak-re, and despite their advanced culture and civilization still thought of them in terms of being black.  He found the women there fascinating due to their exotic nature, but no more than a kind of sexual novelty.  This kind of attitude led to the downfall of Opak-re.</p><p>He met a woman named <a href=\"/anaykah/29-40953/\">Anaykah</a>, one of the city's leading scientists.  She fell in love with both Snow and Blackstock, and became pregnant with the latter's child.  This was a violation of one of the city's strongest prohibitions - no interbreeding.  They were happy to have visitors, but the elders of Opak-re valued their genetic purity more.</p><p>The birth of the child led to the city being sealed off from the world forever.  Before it went, however, Anaykah gove her infant daughter to Elijah Snow, who promised to look after her.  The girl was raised by a couple in Germany, and was named <a href=\"/jakita-wagner/29-6010/\">Jakita Wagner</a>.  Jakita is, technically, the last survivor of Opak-re.</p>",

The Wildcats went into Otherspace for much the same reason. <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\">Spartan</a> planned to use the same kind of sleeping stars to power batteries that would last longer than forever.

Initially crime rates were high in the city and because of the large concentration of super powered beings in one area the city couldn't be police using normal methods so it is policed by the tenth precinct (the tenth referring to the world being parallel ten, the other precincts are housed in other parallel realities) of a special multi world police force head quartered on Grand Central, a world were the Roman empire never fell.

These \"reformed\" science-villains had been granted amnesty so that the government could utilize their engineering and scientific prowess for just such situations.

When the Eternals were made part of the mainstream Marvel canon, the Titans were retconned as a branch of the Eternal race. </p>\n<p>At the dawn of the Eternal race, they were divided into two societies, one which remained on Earth, and one which fled into space. When the Earth <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eternals/65-13344/\">Eternals</a> conducted an experiment in cosmic energy which unleashed the full potential of their godlike powers, the Titanians were too far away to recieve the full benefit, and therefore developed less degrees of power. This experiment turned the leader <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kronos/29-28005/\">Kronos</a> into an immaterial being; his sons, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zuras/29-13798/\">Zuras</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mentor/29-14522/\">A'Lars</a>, both wished to become the next leader, but when Zuras was voted to lead, A'Lars left for Titan to avoid another conflict.

        "description":"<p>This mansion had been inherited by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a> and has been in his family for 10 years.</p><p>The saying of the Institute is 'Mutatis Mutandis', which is Latin meaning 'with those things having been changed which need to be changed'.</p><h2>Layout</h2><p>Located at 1407 Graymalkin Lane in Salem Center, New York, the Xavier Mansion has been home to the X-Men since their inception, and has always been a school and safe haven for any mutants in need. The mansion has been the subject of damage due to battles and has even been destroyed twice. Once during the events of Inferno, in which <a href=\"../../mr-sinister/29-3179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Sinister</a> destroyed the whole mansion, except for its underlying basement (which included the X-Men training-ground; the Danger Room). After some time the mansion was rebuild with funds from investors in Xavier's school.</p><p>The mansion was later badly damaged during an attack by a former instructor, the mutant known as <a href=\"../../xorn/29-3183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xorn</a>, who was posing as Magneto. The end of the battle left long time X-Man Jean Grey dead at the hands of the mad mutant. The mansion got a large renovation after these events, in which almost nothing of the original school could be rebuilt. The school was now in the shape of a giant \"X\". In the middle, there was a courtyard, where mutants could pay respects to the deceased Jean Grey.</p><p>Mutants could train their unique abilities in the a training-room known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a>. There also resides other high-tech equipment such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a>, a mutant tracking device utilized by telepaths like Professor X. This device is in a highly-secured room and is available for only select few people such as Charles Xavier and the <a href=\"../../stepford-cuckoos/65-4443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stepford Cuckoos</a></p><p>There is also a basketball court and a swimming-pool where the students can hang out and play sports, though there is also an opening for the hangar at this location, where many vehicles are parked. The mansion itself acts as a school (see the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> page) and safe haven for mutants everywhere. Its role as a safe place for mutants has extended to all mutants, including former enemies of the X-Men since M-Day, after witch almost 90% of the mutants lost their powers. To safeguard the remaining mutants, the government ordered human-operated Sentinels to stay at the school premises, making sure that the school would not be attacked by outsiders. Although this seemed a bad idea at first to most mutants, (after all Sentinels where originally designed to hunt mutants) most got used to them pretty quickly.</p><p>However, disaster struck the school not long after M-Day. The Sentinels where away on a mission and during this time the school was attacked. The mutants who had lost their powers during M-day were technically no longer mutants and were to go home. A bus with all ex-mutants was about to take off when a rocket was fired at the bus. Nobody could stop it in time and almost everyone inside died that day, including mutants <a href=\"../../dj/29-41703/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DJ</a>, <a href=\"../../rubbermaid/29-41122/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rubbermaid</a> and <a href=\"../../tag/29-40539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tag</a>. After this, all mutants were to stay on the premises of the mansion.</p><p>After the superhuman <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, the mutants were allowed to leave the mansion more often, but the Sentinels remained to safeguard. Not soon after this the mansion was destroyed (for a second time) by those same Sentinels, who were corrupted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a>'s technology. This was done by former X-Man Bishop during the events of the <a href=\"../../messiah-complex/39-48995/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Messiah Complex</a>. After this, the X-Men no longer resided in the area of the school. The team and it's students left the New York area and took <a href=\"../../graymalkin-industries/34-55967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graymalkin Industries</a> as their new base. Not soon after the events of Utopia X, they abandoned this place as well and they now reside on the base they dubbed <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Utopia</a>, an island made from the remnants of Asteroid M, just of the coast of San Fransisco.</p><h2>Teachers</h2><p>The teachers currently teaching and that have taught at some time are:</p><ol><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> taught science and mathematics, but has left the Institute.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> is the co-headmistress of the school, and teaches ethics.

A big donor was the <a>Hellfire Club</a> but they only donated to attend to their private agendas. Xavier discovers from <a>Lilandra</a> that <a>SHIELD</a> was one of the major donors before falling out and now the Shi'ar are the major donors.</p><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>In this reality, the mansion is taken by <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>\u00b4s X-Men as headquarters, the building is ruined but it has devices of high technology.

It was created by <a href=\"/eradicator/29-5377/\">Eradicator</a> when <a href=\"/superman/29-1807\">Superman</a> brought it Earth as his base. It was supposed to turn Earth into the new Krypton. Stopping this from happening, the Fortress would stay hidden as Superman's secret base hidden in the arctic as a way to find out information about his past and purpose of Kyrpton and why he was placed on Earth.</p><h3>Entrance</h3><p>During the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a>, Superman has a fortress built on a cliff side with a giant keyhole. Superman uses a giant key buried in the snow to open the fortress door. When the key is buried, its top can be seen and is disguised as an Airplane path-indicator. The key is so heavy that only Superman can lift it.</p><h3>Trophy Room</h3><p>This room contains souvenirs of missions performed all over the universe.</p><h3>Superman Room</h3><p>There are several rooms in the Fortress dedicated to friends of Superman like a wax museum. The Superman Room contains statures of Superman and Clark Kent.</p><h3>Batman &amp; Robin Room</h3><p>A room dedicated to the exploits of Superman's friends, <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> &amp; <a href=\"/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a>.</p><h3>Super-Mural</h3><p>On one wall of the Fortress, there is a mural that was painted by Superman, depicting how he once created an entire solar system all by himself.</p><h3>Supergirl Room</h3><p>A room dedicated to <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a>.</p><h3>Robot Room</h3><p>A room containing the atomic-powered <a href=\"/superman-robot/29-9576/\">robots</a> that aid Superman in training and in emergencies.</p><h3>Jor-el and Lara Arch</h3><p>Statues of <a href=\"/jor-el/29-9561/\">Jor-El</a> and <a href=\"/lara-lor-van/29-9562/\">Lara</a>, (Superman's parents), supporting a <a href=\"/krypton/34-30670/\">Krypton</a> globe, form an archway.</p><h3>Ma and Pa Kent Room</h3><p>A room dedicated to the memory of Superman's foster parents, <a href=\"/jonathan-kent/29-3617/\">Jonathan</a> and <a href=\"/martha-kent/29-3618/\">Martha Kent</a>.</p><h3>Daily Planet Room</h3><p>A replica of Clark Kent's office at the <a href=\"/daily-planet/34-55695/\">Daily Planet</a>.</p><h3>Supermobile</h3><p>Superman once used the <a href=\"/supermobile/18-34669/\">Supermobile</a> when a asteroid with the properties of a red sun passed over earth. The Android got free and battled the JLA and only Superman was left. Superman escaped to the Fortress and used the Super-mobile to defeat the Android. It also houses a steel diary, it's pen is actually thought guided and writes whatever Superman thinks. There is also the infamous Phantom Zone Projector at the Fortress and the bottled city of Kandor.</p><h3>Other Artifacts found at the Fortress</h3><p><a href=\"/phantom-zone-projector/18-42369/\"><b>Phantom Zone Projector</b></a>: In those day, when you beam someone with the Phantom Zone projector he turns into a Phantom , no one can see, hear or feel him but they can see and hear you. Superman communicates with them using a form of telepathy. Most of the Zoner's reside on Earth since Jor El (Superman's father) was the one who imprisoned him. Thy only way to see a Phantom Zone prisoner is by a special pill. The prisoner is given a pill before he is sent to a ghost like state and when light is passed on to him his skeleton becomes visible. So far only one prisoner who swallowed the pill escaped from the authorities. This prompted the Prisoners to make an oath to help a fellow Prisoner and (even Superman) if the need be.</p><p><a href=\"/kandor/34-41290/\"><b>Bottled city of Kandor</b></a>: Just like the T-Rex in the Batcave, the 'Bottle City of Kandor' is a staple of the Superman lore. Originally it was the city of Kandor on Krypton before it was shrunk by the villain <a href=\"/brainiac/29-4684/\">Brainiac</a>.</p><h2>Doc Savage's Fortress of Solitude</h2><p>In 1933 author Lester Dent created <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doc-savage/29-29227/\">Doc</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doc-savage/29-29227/\">Savage</a> in his first Doc Savage novel <i>The Man of Bronze,</i> along</p><p>with Doc he created the Fortress of Solitude-Doc's arctic retreat.</p><p>Doc's Fortress was quite different from Superman's with his containing a gym, a</p><p>laboratory, a hangar, a solar observatory, a hospital, a factory, and many</p><p>other rooms and buildings. Doc was a big inspiration for the creation of</p><p>Superman, with his first name being Clark and he had a Fortress of Solitude</p><p>which Superman would later have. His original adventures also served as an</p><p>inspiration for Superman and Batman.</p><h2>The New 52</h2><p>Following the aftermath of Flashpoint, Brainiac's origins were reset. Brainiac now is known as \"the Collector\" an artificial intelligences that originally developed on Culon where it believed that the only way to preserve the universe was to save the best of civilazations by micronizing them and then leaving. The Collector would infect various worlds that had a high level of AI systems with its presence before taking the main cities of those worlds. It attacked Krypton years ago and claimed Kandor before later realizing years later that a lone survivor of Krypton had escaped to Earth. Seeking out the Last Son of Krypton, the Collector made contact with Lex Luthor in order to draw Superman out. He then infected John Corben with his influence and transformed him into a cyborg under his control before taking Metropolis like he had taken Kandor years earlier.</p><p>Superman eventually stormed Brainiac's ship and made a deal that if he defeated the Collector Metropolis would go free. The Collector sent Corben after Superman, but due to Superman reasoning with Corben over his feelings for Lois Lane, he broke free of the Collector's control and joined Superman in his attack. Superman then used his rocket from Krypton that had also been micronized with Metropolis to attack the Collector's mind, which the rocket was able to due since it's primary program was to project Kal-el. In doing so, Metropolis was returned to Earth and Superman took possession of the Collector's ship and made it his new Fortress of Solitude.</p><h2>'Superfriends' TV show</h2><p>The Fortress of Solitude is included in the super-friends television series. The Fortress of Solitude was essentially the same as the comic version. In one episode of the Super Friends which Superman died, the Super Friends visited the Fortress of Solitude and it required a giant key to enter the fortress, just like the comic version.</p><h2>Superman movies</h2><p>The Fortress of Solitude has appeared in various Superman films since the 1970s. This version is considerably different than in the comics. In these films, it is usually depicted as a crystal cave that was created by throwing a Kryptonian crystalline object onto the permafrost in Antarctica.</p>",

Brainiac intended to restore the cities on a composite world which he would rule over - a project that would take many years to complete.</p><p><b>Post Shrinking</b></p><p>Sometime after the shrinking of Kandor, and after Krypton itself was destroyed, <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> encountered Brainiac and took the Bottle City of Kandor back to Earth for safekeeping in his <a href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, until such time as he can restore the city to full size.</p><p>Years later, when a <a href=\"/kryptonite/18-32213/\">kryptonite</a> warhead decimated Superman's secret sanctuary, desperate Kandorian scientists had no choice but to cast their bottle city adrift in the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a>.</p><p>Superman has since collected the city and placed it in a bottle containment once more.

Instead of finding the ruins of the once great capital razed by <a href=\"/black-zero/29-61667/\">Black Zero's</a> nuclear device, the Man of Steel also learned that Kandor - prior to its trans-dimensional disappearance - was a vast internment camp for <a href=\"/aliens/12-46567/\">aliens</a>.</p><p>The mighty <a href=\"/ceritak/29-13094/\">Ceritak</a>, son of gentle <a href=\"/cerimul/29-13103/\">Cerimul</a>, a late Elder of Kandor's ruling Council. While Cerimul struggled to unite Kandor in peace following its liberation from Tolos, Ceritak escaped the bottle city and fled to <a href=\"/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a>. His misunderstood attempts to overcome the language barrier earned the horned Kandorian the nickname \"Scorn\" from the Metropolitan media chronicling his exploits.</p><h3>Points of Interest</h3><p><b>The Crystal Hills of Kandor</b> - The Crystal Hills is a restricted historic zone. The old historic scrolls say the hills were a sacred area in prehistoric times. Remains left by the Torgs, a Kryptonian prehistoric cult that worshiped the demon-god Kvorg, including ancient writings and luminescent statuary can be found in caves in the area.</p><h3>Notable Residents</h3><p><b>Arvor</b> - a top inventor</p><p><b>Ken-Dal</b> - a renowned scientist</p><p><b>Yllura</b> - an accomplished archaeologist</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Oa is one of the oldest planets in the DCU. It is the home and headquarters of the <a href=\"../../guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guardians of the Universe</a>, an alien race of blue-skinned, white-haired scientifically powerful humanoids. These aliens have evolved from a planet called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maltus/34-56204/\"><b>Maltus</b></a>. The Guardians administer their brand of policing the Universe by creating champions know as the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a>, a group of powerful universal police officers. Each member of the Green Lantern Corps is equipped by the Guardians with <a href=\"/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">Green Power Rings</a> and a <a href=\"/power-battery/18-55747/\">Green Lantern Power Battery</a> with which to charge the rings. Oa was chosen to be the headquarters of the universe, because it is said by the Guardians that it lies in the center of the universe if we imagine the universe as a sphere. This sphere is divided equally into segments all leading to Oa and those are the patrolling sectors of the Green Lantern Corps.</p><p>Oa appears to have no indigenous life. The plant of Oa's only features are what the Guardians have created on its surface.</p><p>During <a href=\"/emerald-twilight/39-41289/\">Emerald Twilight</a> story arc, the Guardians of the Universe sacrificed themselves to create one final power ring. This power ring is extremely powerful and may be the strongest power ring held by a Green Lantern. This Power Ring was given to the \"Torch-bearer\" <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner.</a> The legendary Green Lantern Corps member <a>Hal Jordan</a>, the Green Lantern of sector 2814, who has now gone rogue under the influence of the evil entity <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a>, killed all but one of the Guardians, <a href=\"/ganthet/29-6951/\">Ganthet</a>, and most of the Corps before draining Oa's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/central-power-battery/18-55704/\">Central Power Battery</a> of its energy. The planet is later destroyed during a battle between Jordan and his successor, Green Lantern <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a>.</p><p>What was the remains of the planet Oa served as a base of operations for the villain <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oblivion/29-2496/\">Oblivion</a> during the <a href=\"/green-latern-circle-of-fire/39-55746/\">Circle of Fire</a> story arc.</p><p>In the graphic novel <b>Legacy: The Last Will and Testament of Hal Jordan</b> Oa is rebuilt as the final wish of Hal Jordan's former power ring. The Central Battery is recharged and the now resurrected Guardians promote Kyle Rayner to the near-omnipotent Ion, solidifying him as the Torch-Bearer and a key element to Oa.</p><p>The Guardians later decide that the Green Lantern Corps is not enough protection for the plant Oa. Now fortified by creating a planet-wide armor and defensive system to prevent attacks, Oa can defend itself. The outer shell is eventually destroyed by the <a href=\"/scar/29-56693/\">Scarred</a> Guardian in order to make Oa vulnerable for the coming of <a href=\"/blackest-night/39-55766/\">Blackest Night</a>.</p><p>In the 31st Century Oa is a barren wasteland with only one Green Lantern, <a href=\"/rond-vidar/29-12860/\">Rond Vidar</a>, and one Guardian, <a href=\"/sodam-yat/29-46185/\">Sodam Yat</a>, remaining. When Rond Vidar is killed during the events of <a href=\"/final-crisis-legion-of-3-worlds/49-37177/\">Legion of 3 Worlds</a>, a downtrodden Yat believes this is the end of the Corps because he has not been able to recreate the Green Lantern Corps for a long time. Eventually he regains the Willpower to restart the Corps, reigniting the Central Power Battery and sending the inert rings out into the universe to find suitable bearers.</p><p><b>Green Lanterns Corps Headquarters</b></p><p><b>Meeting Hall:</b> Large meeting area for roll call, assignments, briefings and general meetings.</p><p><b>Inner Sanctuary:</b> A large room where the Guardians of the Universe reside. It is often locked and the Guardians refuse to see anyone they do not specifically call on. The inside of the sanctuary itself is an empty void that projects all of space, allowing the Guardians to view the status of the universe from inside their sanctuary.</p><p><b>Central Power Battery:</b> The central feature of Oa. It contains the energy that all Green Lantern Rings use to power their rings.</p><p><b>The Foundry:</b> Subterranean foundry where Power Rings and Batteries are forged from pure Willpower.</p><p><b>Hazard Simulation Facility:</b>This is a training ground. Drill Sergeant <a href=\"/kilowog/29-6952/\">Kilowog</a> trains rookies to help them understand how to wield their new power rings.</p><p><b>Dining Hall:</b> The central eating location on Oa. To maintain and sustain any Green Lantern's nutritional needs there is an executive chef, <a href=\"/greet/29-49746/\">Greet</a>, who specializes in replicating dishes from across the universe.</p><p><b>Hall of Great Service:</b> The hall of great service works as a library and safehouse for the recorded stories and deeds of the finest Green Lanterns of all time. These stories and deeds are recorded in the <a href=\"/the-book-of-oa/18-56006/\">Book of Oa</a>, which serves as the law book.</p><p><b>Sector Houses:</b> Sector Houses work as remote jail-houses used to hold criminals as they await escort back to the Oan <a href=\"/sciencells/18-55796/\">Sciencells</a>. These safe-houses serve as sector headquarters for the sector Lanterns.</p><p><b>The Sciencells:</b> Are the jailing system of the Green Lantern Corps.</p><p><b>Memorial Hall:</b> A Green Lantern named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morro/29-49703/\">Morro</a>, and his pet Dratures, are the crypt keepers to the Memorial Hall. Many Lanterns have dies in the line of duty and to honor fallen Green Lanterns they have a statue erected in their memory.</p><p><b>Guy's Place or \"The Big W\":</b>Was a restaurant owned by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guy-gardner/29-1791/\">Guy Gardner</a> and Kyle Rayner, serving Earth's American foods and beverages. Guy Gardner wanted to re-establish this once proud brand of American Fast Food to his fellow Green Lantern Corps and new residence on Oa. The restaurant is eventually wrecked during the <a href=\"/emerald-eclipse/39-55907/\">Emerald Eclipse</a> arc.</p>",

It was the prototype for their future headquarters, the Baxter Building of New York City.</p><p>Upon relocating to NYC, the Fantastic Four originally originally just rented the top five floors of the 35 story Baxter Building; but <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a> eventually bought the entire building to protect the other tenants from super villain attack. It is located on 42nd and Madison Avenue in <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a>. The top six floors are now completely air-tight, with every door being an air-lock. A special elevator would take the team to their floors, with an activator in their belts.</p><p>One of the most well known people to work in the building is mailman <a href=\"../../willie-lumpkin/29-15288/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Willie Lumpkin</a> who has his daily rounds in the building.</p><p>Early in the team's history, the building was rocketed into space towards the Sun by <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> and <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>. Namor eventually realized a double cross and helped the team located the device he planted in the building that put it under Doom's control. They were able to put the building back in place with little to no damage.</p><p>When the team temporarily split up, the <a href=\"/mad-thinker/29-2131/\">Mad Thinker</a> took control of the Baxter Building and encased it in an unknown crystalline compound and took control of it. The Mad Thinker's overconfidence caused his defeat when he allowed the Four to enter the building.</p><p>The adoptive son of <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> eventually sent the whole building into orbit and blew it up in an attempt to kill the Fantastic Four. When the building that replaced it, the <a href=\"/four-freedoms-plaza/34-42378/\">Four Freedoms Plaza</a>, was also destroyed, Reed reconstructed the original Baxter Building in orbit and teleported it it's original place.

        "description":"Silent Hill is a fictional town in the United States of America which is home to many strange paranormal phenomena which may be related to a strong flow of mystical energies. It could be seen as a gateway point between the so called \u201cnormal\u201d world and an alternate reality or realities.<br /><br /><p><strong>Geography and Location</strong></p><p>The town of Silent Hill could be located somewhere in California since it is supposed to be located at the shores of Toluca Lake and there is such a Lake in California. Other possible locations suggested for Silent Hill are Michigan and Maine. In the movie \u201cSilent Hill\u201d the town is located in West Virginia. </p><p>Wherever the location of the town might be, it is clear that this is a small and -one would expect to be- quiet little town on a landscape of forest and mountain and, of course, the Toluca lake. Silent Hill combines the rural landscapes with small semi urban settings. </p><p><strong>Housing and Businesses</strong></p><p>The urban development seems to be mild, since the town presents all of the basic accommodations of modern urban life and even some leisure and entertainment. There are a few hotels and motels; there are several stores; two hospitals; a school; houses and apartment buildings; gas stations; a bowling alley; an orphanage; and at least one church.</p><p><strong>A Haunted Place</strong></p><p>Silent Hill is sometimes referred to as a convergence point between realities. It\u2019s a place where mystic energies flow so freely that reality, fantasy, and worse mix together and successfully turn this once peaceful town into a horrible land governed by the dead and by forces that humans are not able to understand.</p><p><strong>Not a Haunted Place</strong></p><p>Silent Hill is also considered by some to be nothing but a point in which stories of mentally ill beings take place. All in their heads, the town only provides a setting for the dreaded stories their minds come up with to unfold in. </p><p>A common theme in the comics, books and games of Silent Hill is the hinted or sometimes outright told possibility that none of it is real. But never is it confirmed. An important aspect of the town is this very doubt. You never know if you\u2019re witnessing a ghost story or a reality created by a madman in himself.</p><a></a><h2>Recurrent Themes</h2><p>Every story about the town is different. However, most of them exhibit certain elements that together create the ambience of the stories and that make it very distinctive as a Silent Hill story and not just any other horror tale. </p><p>Among these themes are:</p><p><strong>Biblical References</strong></p><p>Silent Hill often makes references to passages and characters named in the bible. Such is the case of demons or verses that can be interpreted in certain ways to fit the story or to aid the characters on their journey.</p><p><strong>Dead Relatives</strong></p><p>One of the many \u201cpowers\u201d the town has is the ability to present apparitions of what is inside a character\u2019s mind. One of the most common apparitions is that of loved ones that are no longer living, as a form of psychological torture. </p><p><strong>Witchcraft</strong></p><p>Spells and incantations are often part of Silent Hill\u2019s stories. Some characters are knowledgeable in the arts of witchcraft and there are many manifestations of it both in the games and comics. One of the most common forms of magic use by the characters is the use of symbols or seals. Sometimes these work as ways of blocking evil out or protecting someone. Sometimes their purpose is to hurt people in some way or control them.</p><p><strong>Numbers and Riddles</strong></p><p>A person inside Silent Hill will most likely be presented with certain riddles that may give a sense of hope to the character, be it false or true hope. Many times, these riddles present themselves as mathematical or numerical problems that a character must either solve or memorize.</p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><p>There are two main roles that children take in the Silent Hill world. One of them is to represent innocence and a worry free life. The other one is as sinister beings that haunt or somehow try to harm the main characters.</p><p>Children are rarely just normal people in Silent Hill. They may be undead, or ghosts. Some are magical in nature.</p><p>Along with children per se, there is also the subject of infancy since some grown up characters have been shown to have some particular trauma or very specific memory from childhood that plays a part in the stories of Silent Hill. </p><p><strong>Guilt</strong></p><p>Most of the main characters in the stories of Silent Hill are somehow troubled souls and some of them are suffering from past mistakes. Regret is usually one of the subtexts of the story. Some characters are too burdened with guilt to live a normal life and Silent Hill plays on these regrets by manifesting guilty images straight from the character\u2019s subconscious mind.</p><p>Since Silent Hill can be seen as a sort of psychological purgatory, characters are often atoning for their misdeeds.</p><a></a><h2>Stories in Silent Hill</h2><p><strong>Among the Damned</strong></p><p>This comic tells the story of Jason a tormented soldier that wants to kill himself. He dreams about Silent Hill and his old unit. They\u2019re all there fighting the demons of Silent Hill. </p><p>He arrives at the town to have some food before he goes up the mountain and kills himself. </p><p>We hear about Dahlia, a singer that is often in Jason\u2019s dreams. Somewhere a radio is playing and we hear some speculation about Dahlia killing herself. </p><p>Apparently Jason had some sort of accident and he wakes inside his upside down car. He seems to remember seeing a girl in front of the car before the accident happened. He goes back to town to get help, but the town seems empty. He finds a payphone and intends to use it, but it isn\u2019t working properly. Then he is attacked by the monsters of his dreams. He runs and finds himself a pistol shop where he gets a shot gun and uses it against the creatures. </p><p>He finds Dahlia in an amusement park and helps her escape from the monsters. She is wounded in the process. They are helped by Aaron, Jason\u2019s dead friend from the military. </p><p>Dahlia and Jason retreat into a store where people are hiding. It appears that the demons are kept out of this place because of some sacred signs painted in blood. Jason takes Dahlia to the infirmary where she begins having strange visions of herself surrounded by monsters, she\u2019s some sort of a queen or goddess. She wakes up and has sex with Jason.</p><p>When daylight comes the beasts retreat so Jason and Dahlia leave the sanctuary to try to escape from the town. Soon they encounter the dead soldiers from Jason\u2019s unit Aaron is calling out to Jason, telling him that it is time. Jason shoots him and runs with Dahlia. They go into a church. There they are attacked by more monsters and Dahlia turns into a monster herself, yet she saves Jason, throwing him out of the church and she gives him her heart (literally). Outside Jason meets his soldier friends again. Aaron tells him that the reason that he\u2019s alive is that Aaron made some sort of deal to exchange his life for the life of his friend so that Jason could go on.</p><p>Jason and Dahlia both leave Silent Hill and it is hinted that they might start a new life.</p><p><strong>Dying Inside</strong></p><p>Famed psychiatrist named Troy Abernathy is called on his talent wasting ways by a coworker of his. Dr. Abernathy used to be a great therapist; he used to connect with his patients. However, after his wife\u2019s suicide, he\u2019s not the same. The guilt and grief changed him.</p><p>He takes a new patient. A young film student named Lynn who had recently gone to Silent Hill to take stock footage and sell it to major companies. He tried every method he new, including heavy medication but nothing worked.</p><p>As a last measure, he decides to take Lynn back to Silent Hill; to make her confront her fears and finally be able to come to terms with whatever she had suffered that had traumatized her so.</p><p>To Troy\u2019s surprise, Silent Hill receives him with imagery of his dead wife, Juliana, and hellish beasts. Lynn snaps out of her sedative induced state and both of them try to run. They find a little girl named Christabella who seems to be controlling the beasts. She tells Lynn that she let her go in the first place and that she was supposed to bring people with the footage she had shot.</p><p>They are saved by a man named Brett, who is revealed to be Juliana\u2019s ex-husband. Lynn and Troy run from Brett, as he was also supposed to be dead and exhibits a fracture in the back of the skull. </p><p>It is explained that Troy had killed Brett because he had abused Juliana when they were married. Juliana, upon learning that, killed herself.</p><p>They are again confronted by Christabella. Troy offers himself in exchange for his patient\u2019s safe passage. Christabella accepts the deal.</p><p>The footage Lynn had initially shot is stolen by a group of young rebels. Clown, as he called himself, tells his friends about how the tape had changed from the first time he had seen it. And he, along with Lauryn (his girlfriend), Payne (his brother) and his large group of friends embark on a journey to Silent Hill at the request of Lauryn.</p><p>When they arrive, they are attacked by the beasts. And Lauryn takes out a few books on magic and demons that are supposed to help them in their journey. Little by little they are confronted with what the town has to offer and what was inside Dr. Abernathy\u2019s mind. Eventually, Lauryn casts a spell to rid herself of Christabella, who is explained to be Lauryn\u2019s dead sister. As a young girl she had been brutally murdered in Silent Hill and Lauryn blamed herself for it. The spell fails and she is forced to run.</p><p>She finds the deceased Dr. Abernathy and comes to realize that the monsters that are in control of Troy are different from the ones her sister controls.</p><p>The dead friends that Christabella calls back to her aid had been marked by Lauryn prior to their trip. And thus become Lauryn\u2019s beasts instead.</p><p>After realizing that she must destroy her sister, she finds Dr. Abernathy again, who tells her that behind a certain door there is a patient that must be awakened for Christabella\u2019s existence to cease.</p><p>The door is locked, however, by a mathematical problem. The armies of Christabella\u2019s beasts fight against those Abernathy and Lauryn control.</p><p>Finally, she opens the door and the story Troy had told her is revealed false.</p><p>Lauryn then realizes that the town is actually under her control. That it\u2019s all in her mind due to her guilt of Christabella\u2019s death. She casts every monster off with a thought and leaves a now powerless Christabella under the care of Dr. Troy.</p><p>She tells Clown and Payne, the only surviving friends, to leave. Lauryn had been born in silent hill, her sister had died there. That\u2019s what caused it all. Clown and Payne leave and Lauryn stays in Silent Hill, the only town in the world that made sense to her. She stays there to make sure that what happened to her sister wouldn\u2019t happen again to anyone.</p><p><strong>Dead/Alive</strong></p><p>Christabella finds herself longing to hold the power she once held. The creatures in Silent Hill, though still existing are under the rule of Lauryn. They are prohibited to harm any tourists that might come into town.</p><p>The little eight-year-old, though, feels that things should go back to the way they used to be: Herself holding the power. She wakes up one day, finds that the mist that used to cover the whole town is back, and that the beasts roam free again. She finds Lauryn\u2019s room locked and chained and knows that the book inside will grant her the power again. </p><p>She orders a beast to aid her, but is bitten instead and finds she\u2019s no longer her ghouly self, but flesh and blood once again. Chistabella runs, but soon comes to a dead end and is confronted by many beasts with whom she offers to deal.</p><p>Meanwhile, famous actor Kenneth Carter, who enjoys collecting paintings of a place called Silent Hill, receives a phone call. He is told of the disappearance of his lost love, Connie.</p><p>That same night, he sees his very bathroom bleed. The walls turn to flesh and monstrous beings form from it. His whole house is like this; except for the places his paintings used to occupy\u2026 they\u2019re blank empty spaces now.</p><p>In comes a woman who identifies herself as Lenora. She says she will allow him to search for Connie. Kenneth enters one of the paintings following Bear, his dog, and finds himself inside Silent Hill.</p><p>He runs into a lost girl who\u2019s looking for help. Her name: Christabella.</p><p>The two of then explore the town, where the beasts seem to notice their presence, but do not attack. They reach an old office where they find files and pictures regarding Kenneth\u2019s life before adoption. Information he had been paying large sums of money for to no avail.</p><p>They reach a movie theatre, inside; a projection of Connie appears on the screen. She\u2019s been turned into a monster by Lenora and sends Dr. Abernathy after them, also informing Kenneth that he has killed his current girlfriend, Jessica. Christabella finds herself with power once again and destroys the doctor.</p><p>Thy run out and find a heavily armed man named Ike Isaacs, he\u2019s the painter of the pictures Kenneth collects, and tells them a \u201chot goth chick\u201d sent him to help them.</p><p>They team up and run through own, destroying the beasts as they come. They reach a festival filled with monsters and Ike finds a Keris, an ancient mystical Indonesian dagger that absorbs souls.

He must murder Christabella, Bear or Connie or the three of them will die.</p><p>Christabella attacks Lenora with the Keris, however this doesn\u2019t work. Bear runs away and Kenneth, using the axe with which he is supposed to kill one of his companions, breaks Connie\u2019s chains instead.

While Kenneth discovers that killing Connie is the only way out. He does, and wakes up from a dream. He\u2019s not Kenneth Carter, the actor. He\u2019s a dirt farmer and is living happily with Connie somewhere else.</p><p><strong>Paint it Black</strong></p><p>This comic tells the story of Ike Isaacs, a slacker and artist that is always leeching off his friends while he dedicates to his paintings. He is attracted to Silent Hill and he goes there to live. He finds himself a place to live and the town itself seems to provide him with everything he needs. All of the monsters that attack every other person that come into the town leave him be and allow him to work on his paintings. They seem to be interested in being portrayed as art pieces by the hands of the artist.</p><p>Ike has been in Silent Hill for several months when he finds out that someone has been selling his paintings, and that he\u2019s made a name for himself in the outside world. He tries to leave town to cash in on his newly acquired fame, but it is forced by the town to remain there, as every time he gets close to the exit the fog drags him back to the center of the town. Somehow he accepts this and goes back to his work and his lonely life.</p><p>One day a group of cheerleaders, leaded by decisive Cheryl, arrives at Silent Hill. Ike is unwilling to help them and he wants them to leave as soon as possible and let him be. He feels the cheerleaders have invaded his personal space and he warns them that the beasts in his paintings are in fact real, and that they will kill them. The girls take the warning very lightly and after locking Ike away in a room, they continue to make themselves at home. Then a couple of the girls (Missy and Chrissy) are kidnapped by the monsters so Cheryl asks for Ike\u2019s help to get them back. He tells them what he knows about the monster\u2019s hiding places and he points out to a bowling alley as the probable spot for them to keep the girls. </p><p>Ike and the cheerleaders go to the rescue. The girls have found guns and ammunition and they are heavily armed. They face the demons fearlessly and they make it to the interior of the bowling alley. There Ike and Cheryl go to help Missy while the rest of the girls is in charge of getting Chrissy. </p><p>Ike and Cheryl find themselves cornered by the monsters without a way out until Ike paints a black hole on the wall and they exit through it. He explains later that he sort of felt like the hole was already there and he just painted on it. They find themselves in a place filled with Ike\u2019s paintings and after fighting some monsters they set the paintings on fire. Then they walk through a hallway and they spot some of the monsters. They are working in some sort of assembly factory. They continue on until the find both Missy and Chrissy tied up and about to be eaten by the monsters. One of them is talking about how fear flavors the meat.</p><p>They engage the demons in combat and Cheryl is hit and looses her weapon. Ike tells the demons to stop, he tells them that if they want him to keep painting, that they should let them go. They get mad at him and get ready to attack, but Ike\u2019s bought enough time for Cheryl and the other two cheerleaders to get a hold of a flamethrower. They use it and Ike throws a can of red paint against the wall. The girls escape through the hole and he stays behind to hold off the monsters. Cheryl told Ike that she would come back for him, but in the end she decides to leave him behind. As the cheerleaders are driving off away from Silent Hill, Missy and Chrissy are consoling Cheryl. They tell her that soon there is going to be so much going on that she won\u2019t even remember his name. We see that the two of them have been turned into monsters themselves.</p><p><strong>The Grinning Man</strong></p><p>The story begins with a mysterious grinning guy who after blowing up someone in a mine hitches a ride towards Silent Hill. </p><p>Robert Tower has been a state trooper for years. He\u2019s on his final day before retiring and getting a new life in the Keys. He\u2019s familiar with the town of Silent Hill and knows of the stories about ghosts and demons that supposedly inhabit the place. However in all his years of patrolling he\u2019s never seen anything paranormal so he believes that all of the strange disappearances and deaths are due to drug lords taking over the town\u2019s abandoned buildings.</p><p>He gets a call to a murder scene on the road where he meets FBI agent Mayberry who tells him that this crime scene was obviously staged to divert the police attention from the people that are missing. Tower suggests that the one responsible might be in Silent Hill since the treads on the road seem to be headed that way. </p><p>He goes there with Mayberry who tells him about his believes that the town is haunted and inhabited by some creatures that are of paranormal nature. He\u2019s quite exited about exploring the place. </p><p>As this goes on we see that the Grinning Man is killing the monsters in Silent Hill, he rescues some people from the creatures and then he tells them that he\u2019s got plans for them.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Lakeview Hotel, some policemen are preparing to play a joke on Mayberry. They\u2019ve disguised as monsters and they expect to scare the FBI agent. Instead, they are murdered by the Grinning Man who was chasing some of the creatures.</p><p>Mayberry and Tower see a light coming out of the Lakeview Hotel. They go to check it out and they are met by the monsters that recognize Tower and they let them go. Then they find a couple of girls in a room unable to leave because of some seals that the Grinning Man has drawn on them and on the walls. Mayberry says that those look like druidic drawings or maybe kabalistic. Tower shoots at the seals on the walls, destroying them and thus setting the girls free. Then outside the hotel they are met by \u201cSawbones\u201d and \u201cStiff\u201d who ask Tower to kill them as they have been under the control of the Grinning Man for quite some time. Tower abides and goes looking for the man responsible for all of it.</p><p>When they find the Grinning Man they notice that he is not being attacked by the creatures. They cannot harm him but he can harm them. They escape from the grinning man and Tower tells Mayberry to stay behind as he\u2019s going back to save the rest of the people. He realizes that the reason the monsters had let him live and had not manifested themselves to him in the past was because he was helping them by spreading the word that the town was nothing out of this world. </p><p>Tower finds more people that seem undead. They tell him that is too late for him to help them but that they will help him to get back at the Grinning Man. He shoots the seals on the walls to finally set the people free and one dead kid tells him that the monsters do not want to harm him because they want him to help them defeat the Grinning Man, but also that the magic that this guy exerts on them is making them mad and hungry and they might eventually attack him.</p><p>Tower finds the Grinning Man and he has just killed Mayberry. They go into one final showdown in which tower kills the Grinning Man who cannot believe that his magic has been beaten.</p>",

It was primarily the home of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> on several different occasions, and has repeatedly come under attack. It was a mostly composed of nickel and iron, which made it very susceptible to Magneto's magnetic powers. The asteroid also contained various life-supporting habitats on the surface and most likely underground as well. One frequently used tactic by Magneto was to suspend it within the Earth's atmosphere by magnetic levitation directly over any target he wished to intimidate.</p><p>Magneto often withdrew from regular human society, and took up residence on Asteroid M. At various times, it was also the home of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exodus/29-4567/\">Exodus</a> and the other <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/acolytes/65-9730/\">Acolytes</a>, including the X-Man <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> and the former <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rusty-collins/29-13376/\">Rusty</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skids/29-3194/\">Skids</a>. However, it had been attacked and knocked out of orbit on different occasions. One such attack was the result of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a>, when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/holocaust/29-15071/\">Holocaust</a> first arrived in the Earth-616 universe he appeared on Asteroid M wantonly murdering and killing anyone who stood in his way.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1909572\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1909572-tumblr_lj71gfphml1qgxdzv_super.jpg\" title=\"Asteroid M in Orbit\"><img id=\"1909572\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1909572-tumblr_lj71gfphml1qgxdzv_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Asteroid M in Orbit\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Asteroid M in Orbit</div></div></div></div><p>Asteroid M was also used as part of Magneto's plans when he was disguised as <a href=\"/xorn/29-3183/\">Xorn</a>. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantomex/29-4281/\">Fantomex</a> infiltrated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/weapon-plus/65-40591/\">Weapon Plus</a>, they were sent into space. It wasn't until Magneto began to set his plans into motion that they realised the space station was really Asteroid M in disguise. Part of Magneto's plan was to destroy the trapped X-Men by sending Asteroid M crashing into the sun.</p><p>There have been a few different versions of Asteroid M, although the concept was usually the same: to provide a safe secluded home for mutants. Sometimes Magneto was able to repair it through using his own magnetic powers. Other times he simply replaced it and started again on a new asteroid. It is yet unrevealed which version of Asteroid M was located on the floor of San Francisco Bay.</p><h3>Utopia</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1909575\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1909575-tumblr_lj71gfphml1qgxdzv_super.jpg\" title=\"Utopia\"><img id=\"1909575\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1909575-tumblr_lj71gfphml1qgxdzv_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Utopia\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Utopia</div></div></div></div><p>Asteroid M had crashed down to Earth, and had seemingly been forgotten. However, the X-Men's specialist science team known as the X-Club located the remains of Asteroid M underwater in San Francisco Bay. Working in submarines and scuba apparatus they managed to repair the life support systems and turned the asteroid's technology into reclamation hardware. The asteroid was rocketed from the floor of San Francisco Bay up to the surface where it became an island in the middle of the bay. The X-Men took over the remains of Asteroid M and turned it into their new home, named Utopia. There, they offered all the remaining mutants and their families a home and a chance to live in peace, without fear of persecution.</p><p>Magneto (after regaining his mutant powers) flew to Utopia and offered to peacefully join the X-Men.</p>",

The layout of the Danger Room has not changed considerably since its earliest mention. The room itself is quite large, and there is a central control room and observatory overlooking it where the entire room can be controlled by a single person.</p><p>Since the beginning the Danger Room has underwent a series of upgrades. The first was the addition of robots to the room for combat training. Later, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/12-43138/\">Shi'ar</a> technology was incorporated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a>, upgrading the room to incorporate realistic holograms to the training and adding to the weapons and traps that the X-Men faced while training.</p><p>At some point the Danger Room has gained sentience. It is unclear when this happened, but it was revealed that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Xavier</a> was aware it and chose to leave it imprisoned in the room. The room began to attack students that were inside, and its core was accidentally freed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. Constructing a body resembling a human female, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger/40862/\">Danger</a> has become an enemy of the X-Men. Currently the Danger Room is inactive as it has lost its control system. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prodigy/40475/\">Prodigy</a>, a student at the Xavier Institute, constructed a \"Danger Cave\" with similar functionality before losing his powers as a result of M-Day.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1728975\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1728975-killing_zone_super.jpg\" title=\"Killing zone\"><img id=\"1728975\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1728975-killing_zone_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Killing zone\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Killing zone</div></div></div></div><p>Killing zone: This zone resembles the actual Danger Room, it is a state of the art in training technology and it is located in Wundagore Mountain at Magneto\u00b4s mutant Sanctuary.</p><h2>Other media</h2><p>Danger Room appears in every X-Men series but it was most commonly used in X-Men Evolution where it was not only used to train and practice but was also used to clean the X-Jet,use a training simulator to simulate results and one of the more common uses was to protect something of value to the X-Men or to protect someone like Professor X or injured Teammates while away on a mission or during a siege or attack on the X-Mansion, and for a very short time was used to protect Cerebro from Mystique while everyone was away on a mission.</p><h3>X-Men: The Last Stand</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1728985\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1728985-danger_room_super.jpg\" title=\"Finishing session\"><img id=\"1728985\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1728985-danger_room_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Finishing session\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Finishing session</div></div></div></div><p>It appears at the begging of the movie.

        "description":"<p>To learn about and understand the hellish place called Murderworld, one first must learn about it's psychotic creator, funder, and user: the madman known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arcade/8429/\">     Arcade</a>. </p><a> </a><a> </a><p> Murderworld is constantly changing to fit the unlucky person stuck in it. There are many Murderworld facilities, designed for a different hero. For instance, when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/2114/\">     Thing</a> was trapped in a Murderworld,  Arcade designed robot versions of the past versions of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/2267/\">     Hulk</a>, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maestro/7865/\">     Maestro</a> and Joe Fixit. Poor  Thing had to fight each one, right in a row. He barely made it out alive. There are a few small idiosyncrasies of Murderworld. Murderworld is designed like an amusement park or a carnival. Clown-robots, huge flowers that squirt acid, bumper cars with spikes that go towards someone at 100 mph, all the traps are somehow carnival related. It costs 1,000,000 dollars to send someone to Murderworld, although  Arcade doesn't need it. Only two people work with  Arcade on Murderworld, the mysterious Miss Locke and Mr. Chambers. They clean out Murderworld, fix traps, feed Arcade, create new traps, organize files, whatever is needed to keep the carnival going. Almost nothing is known about them.  Arcade has one similarity to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joker/1702/\">     Joker</a>, too-unlike your typical mastermind who believes his trap is unbeatable,  Arcade leaves a tiny, miniscule chance for his victim to escape. This is often his downfall, but  Arcade has a simple reason. \"If you're going to kill them, at least have the decency to do it quickly, painlessly!\" said someone who learned about Murderworld. Arcade laughed and replied, \"Decency's dull... besides, miss, your way, they're dead and that's that. My way, they've got a chance. Not much of one, but a chance.\"</p><a> </a><h2>Murderworld History</h2><p> The first people ever caught in Murderworld were a duo. In Marvel Team-Up #65, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/1443/\">     Spider-Man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/7477/\">     Captain Britain</a> were trapped in Murderworld. They made it out, but were shaken by the experience. It was the world's first taste of Murderworld. Over the years, many victims were trapped in Murderworld, including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/longshot/6757/\">     Longshot</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phil-urich/2246/\">     Phil Urich</a>(also known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/1484/\">     Green Goblin</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-rider/4268/\">     Ghost Rider</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/1468/\">     Doctor Doom</a>. He also fights teams like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/3173/\">     X-Men</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/24131/\">     X-Factor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-flight/14616/\">     Alpha Flight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/excalibur/14864/\">     Excalibur</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/micronauts/10980/\">     Micronauts</a>. And occasionally, two people get trapped in Murderworld and have to fight out together. Examples are <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/1440/\">     Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/1499/\">     Gambit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/archangel/2112/\">     Archangel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/1464/\">     Iceman</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/1460/\">     Colossus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/3548/\">     Kitty Pryde</a>. Murderworld hasn't killed any major heroes yet.&nbsp; Recently,  Arcade sold one of his Murderworlds to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/viper/3420/\">     Viper</a>, who tried to kill a powerless <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/1444/\">     Storm</a> and the Queen of England. However, they escaped.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Murderworld has also been reduced to a traveling show, bringing the entertainment in a more versatile manner.&nbsp; One stop was in Phoenix, Arizona, where Arcade kidnapped <a href=\"/shatterstar/29-2156/\">  Shatterstar</a> and <a href=\"/adam-x-treme/29-15108/\"> Adam X</a> and pitted them against each other, controlling the action with mind games.&nbsp; Neither man died, however, and Arcade escaped due to the fact that an android acted as proxy.<br /></p><a> </a><h2>Ultimate Murderworld</h2><p> In the Ultimate universe, Arcade is an assassin but does not use Murderworld. It is only mentioned as the name of a video game he designed which got him his fortune.</p>",

        "description":"&nbsp;<br /><h2>Topography</h2>Unlike other planetary bodies away from Earth, the surface of the Moon is somewhat familiar to astronomers (the surface of the Moon is more easily observed with the naked eye than planets are with telescopes.) &nbsp;The Moon does not have its own atmosphere as its gravity is too weak to maintain one. &nbsp;Its surface is marked by many meteor strikes, including among them <a href=\"/copernicus-crater/34-57845/\">Copernicus</a>. &nbsp;<br /><br /><h2>The DC Universe</h2><p>The most notably variant aspect of the Moon as it stands in the DC Universe is that for the better part of the last decade, it housed the legendary <a href=\"/justice-league-watchtower/34-41469/\">Justice League Watchtower</a>. Because of their presence there, the Moon experienced quite a few world-shattering events first hand. Throughout the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League Of America</a>'s tenure on the surface of the Moon, it has been pulled from orbit several times, nearly destroyed, and been hit by all manner of different weapons and entities.</p><p>However, with the advent of the <a href=\"/jla/49-5957/\">JLA</a> story arc \"Crisis of Conscience\", and the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a>, the Watchtower has been destroyed by <a href=\"/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Superman Prime</a> and <a href=\"/alex-luthor/29-24087/\">Alex Luthor</a>. Its towering ruins still stand to this day.</p><h2>The Marvel Universe</h2><p>The Moon of the Marvel Universe is notable in that it contains an area known as the Blue Area of the Moon. The Blue Area lies on the far side of the Moon in the Luther Crater. This portion of the Moon was artificially altered and given an Earth-like environment approximately 100,000 years ago as a result of a competition between two alien races, the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a> and the Cotati, to see who could create a better habitat. The Cotati won but the Kree, angry in defeat, attacked the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> and initiated the Kree-Skrull War. Not only was the Moon the cause for this war that had a major impact on the Marvel Universe, it also became a home to various beings. When the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> made a trip to the moon they found that it was where Uatu the Watcher lived and from where he watched all of humanity. Apart from Uatu, the Blue Area of the Moon was where the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> made their home. The Inhumans moved their city (called Attilan) from Earth to the Blue Area after conflicts with Humans. The Blue Area also sustained the life of another alien race, but they died long before humans ever knew they existed and all that remains are ruins.</p><p>The other big thing that the Marvel Moon is known for is as the stage for the ending of the <a href=\"/dark-phoenix-saga/39-42183/\">Dark Phoenix Saga</a>. The Shi'ar, fearing the power of the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>, bring the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> to the moon where they must fight the Imperial Guard, with the winner deciding the fate of the Phoenix. The X-Men were losing and, after going crazy, Jean regained control and used a Kree weapon to kill herself and save everyone else. The X-Men were returned safely to Earth, and the Moon was left intact.</p><h2>The Wildstorm Universe</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"94420\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/94420-158265-the-moon_super.jpg\" title=\"caption\"><img id=\"94420\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/94420-158265-the-moon_medium.jpg\" alt=\"caption\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">caption</div></div></div></div><p>The Wildstorm Moon doesn't have regular inhabitants like DC and Marvel, but a few things have happened there. In August of 1974, the Moon was moved from it's orbit by Mr. Majestic. It was the first test of his <a href=\"/planet-movers/18-41606/\">Planet Movers</a> and first step in hiding the solar system from the <a href=\"/cosmic-negator/29-40701/\">Cosmic Negator</a>. Not only was it moved though, it was moved in total secret. With machines set up all over the Earth and everyone watching the President resign on TV, the Moon was moved out of it's orbit. Another secret of the Wildstorm Moon is that it contains a Daemonite outpost. The base is small but has computers that hold massive amounts of information from all over the multiverse and also access to <a href=\"/the-bleed/34-41042/\">The Bleed</a>. The Bleed gates on the Moon provide a way to get to different dimensions and also let things from different dimensions into the Wildstorm one. Mr. Majestic got pulled into the gate by a Daemonite scout and ended up in the DC Universe. While he was gone from the Wildstorm Universe, Daemonites from another reality broke through and took over the planet Earth. Majestic eventually got back to his reality and, after traveling back in time to before the Daemonites got through, destroyed the base, so currently there is no Daemonite base on the moon. The last feature of the Moon is actually very similar to the DC Moon, if it exists. In a special issue of <a href=\"/planetary/49-7506/\">Planetary</a> it was revealed that <a href=\"/planetary/65-40401/\">Planetary</a> has a base on the Moon called the Watchtower. However, the issue (Terra Occulta) was crossover with the JLA and was an Elseworlds tale so there may not actually be a Planetary Watchtower.</p><p>In <a href=\"/authority-the/49-11205/\">The Authority</a> and tried to terraform the moon. It wasn't actually God, but that's what <a href=\"/the-authority/65-40399/\">The Authority</a> started calling the alien being that had sparked life on Earth. The whole process started right before the new millennium with giant, worm-like creatures landing on the Moon (and in Africa). In order to rid the Moon of its worm infestation (and also protect Earth), <a href=\"/apollo/29-2197/\">Apollo</a> supercharged himself by taking a dip in the sun and then releasing all that energy onto the Moon, sterilizing it. After the Moon and Africa were cleared, the team took on God (a giant pyramid thing) and <a href=\"/jenny-sparks/29-2203/\">Jenny Sparks</a> died killing it.</p><p>At the start of <a href=\"/worlds-end/39-55682/\">World's End</a>, <a href=\"/the-high/29-24389/\">The High</a> smashed one of his clones into the moon, destroying a large part of it.</p><h2>Image</h2><p>In the Image Universe, the <a href=\"/the-noble-family/65-55524/\">Noble Family</a> has a base on the moon. Also, in one issue of <a href=\"/brit/49-19151/\">Brit</a>, a ship full of stoned aliens crash landed on the surface of the moon.</p><h2>Other/All</h2><p>Other than the places on the Moon, the Moon itself has often been used as a place for superheroes to get away from the troubles of the world and think for a while. Most of the heroes that handle problems on a global scale and can fly and survive in space have at some point gone to the Moon for some peace and quiet. Superman types especially (for some reason) like the Sentry, Invincible and Superman himself frequently take time to relax in the comfort of the Moon. There are also heroes that get their powers from the Moon. The most well known of these would be <a href=\"/moon-knight/29-1493/\">Moon Knight</a> (or even <a href=\"/sailor-moon/29-50482/\">Sailor Moon</a>). Moon Knight gets his powers from Khonshu, the Egyptian moon god. There are also heroes who use the moon as a symbol even if they don't get powers from it. <a href=\"/midnighter/29-2196/\">Midnighter</a>, for example.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>It has been home to many nefarious villains including <a href=\"/general-zod/29-13075/\">General Zod</a> and his conspirators. The Phantom Zone has been used or discovered by other cultures and been referred to as the Still Zone (White Martians), Ghost Zone (Prometheus), Buffer Zone (Bgztlians), Stasis Zone (Loophole) and Honeycomb (Queen Bee). The villain <a href=\"/prometheus/29-22784/\">Prometheus</a> used it as a base of operations and the <a href=\"/white-martians/65-11285/\">White Martians</a> used it to hide their invasion fleet. They were later imprisoned there by the <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a> using <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>'s <a href=\"/phantom-zone-projector/18-42369/\">Phantom Zone Projector</a>.</p><p>The Phantom Zone has not just been used as a prison or a place to hide. <a href=\"/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> used it to save the life of the hero <a href=\"/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-El</a> when he was dying from lead poisoning, since time does not pass in the Phantom Zone, and there he would not succumb to his illness.</p><p>In Pre-Crisis DC, while in the Zone one does not require sustenance and becomes telepathic; they are able to observe the normal universe, but are unable to interact with it.</p><p>Superman once possessed an arrow that would trap whoever it struck in the Phantom Zone, Roy Harper then stole it but never used it rather passing it down to his successor Mia Dearden who used it to entrap Superboy-Prime. He proved to be too powerful and managed to break free of the Phantom Zone.</p><h2>Inmates Or Other Inhabitants</h2><p>Phantoms: Hate that others use their dimension as a prison where their worst criminals are imprisoned and so they seek revenge on those responsible.</p><p><a href=\"/general-zod/29-13075/\">General Zod</a>: Perhaps the most famed criminal in the Phantom Zone he is the one most commonly portrayed in television and movies. He is seen as the one who destroyed Krypton and for that reason was sentenced to dwelling in the Phantom Zone for eternity. While there he and Ursa had a child, Lor-Zod who eventually managed to be free of the Phantom Zone.</p><p><a href=\"/ursa/29-41953/\">Ursa</a></p><p><a href=\"/jax-ur/29-16345/\">Jax-Ur</a>: The self-proclaimed \"worst criminal in the Phantom Zone\" he is the first to actually be exiled to it. The Kryptonians did this because of the fact that he performed illegal experiments that resulted in the destruction of one of Krypton's moons.</p><p><a href=\"/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-El</a>: Mon-El, a traveling companion of Superboy once contracted lead poisoning and though he was temporarily granted a cure it eventually began to wear off. So Superboy placed him in the Stasis Zone (only later realizing what it was) where Mon-El remained so that he could continue living.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p>In Smallville the Phantom Zone is a prison that can only be accessed through crystals. Jor-El imprisoned the worst prisoners from all the 28 known galaxies there and when he died with Krypton he sent his apprentice, Raya there in case anything should happen, to keep the prisoners in check.</p><p>In the Phantom Zone, prisoners who spend enough time in there become Phantoms, beings that can possess others and are only harmed by Jor-El's crystal. Also it seems Kryptonians (and perhaps other species) become powerless in the Phantom Zone.</p><p>Some ways to create portals to the Phantom Zone are through bracelets possessed by General Zod and his disciples, the Fortress of Solitude, and with blood of the House of El.</p><p>When Clark opened the gateway he accidentally released several criminals from the Phantom Zone onto earth where they murdered many and Clark made it his personal mission to send all criminals back to the Phantom Zone (with the crystal) or kill them.</p><p>Beings who were known to at least at some time be imprisoned in there were:</p><p>Kal-El: Imprisoned there by General Zod when he refused to become his servant, accidentally released many other criminals to wreak havoc on Earth.</p><p>Raya: The \"Gatekeeper\" of the Phantom Zone, she was the apprentice of Jor-El and imprisoned there to save her from Krypton's destruction and to watch the criminals.</p><p>General Zod: Destroyer of Krypton, he was trapped there but freed by the joint efforts of his Disciples, Brainiac and Kal-El (who unleashed him unintenionally). He was eventually sent back to the Phantom Zone after being \"torn out\" of his vessel, Lex Luthor, when the crystal was put in the palm of his hand by Kal-El.</p><p>Nam-Ek: Kryptonian. The male Disciple of Zod. He was sent into the Phantom Zone by Kal-El where he was eventually killed by Raya.</p><p>Aethyr: Kryptonian. The female Disciple of Zod. She was sent into the Phantom Zone by Kal-El but what happened since is unknown.</p><p>Gloria: Her powers are similar to that of Poison Ivy and she was imprisoned for killing her whole urban planet with the plant life that she manipulates. In Smallville she stole power from males by using her plants, plants that could harm Kal-El. She was electrocuted by Kal-El and killed.</p><p>Baern: He became a Phantom in the Phantom Zone and on Earth possessed a boy from the East Coast. He could sense and absorb energy, usually radioactive, and expel it in powerful blasts. He fought both Raya and Kal-El eventually gaining power from a limitless power source, Brainiac. He then killed Raya but was sent by to the Phantom Zone by Kal-El.</p><p>Aldar: He was found by Kal-El in Seattle as he had killed thirty or so people when he ripped out the bones and feasted on their marrow. He appears to be far stronger than Kal-El and was about to kill Kal-El when the Martian Manhunter killed him.</p><p>\"Dr. Hudson\": A Phantom. He attempted to possess Kal-El, but his Kryptonian nature made it a battle for the Phantom to possess Kal-El. \"Dr. Hudson\" had to convince Kal-El, his life was a lie, so that he would give up on it, but the Martian Manhunter helped Clark expel the Phantom and then sent him back to the Phantom Zone.</p><p>Titan: He is a warrior who kills for sport. He was put in an illegal cage match, life or death, gladiatorial combat arena where he killed \"meteor-freaks\" from Belle-Reve. Kal-El wished to fight him and when there fight came, Titan seemed to be far stronger than Kal-El but eventually Kal-El overpowerd him after a huge battle, and for the first time he wanted to kill and Titan was impaled on the own spike that he kept on his wrist to impale his victims.</p><p>Bizarro: Phantom. He was created by Kryptonians but he would not be complete until he had bonded with a Kryptonian. On Earth he killed many civilians as they were inadequate as hosts for him. He nearly killed the Martian Manhunter and then proceeded to pass through Kal-El, becoming just like him, \"just a little more bizarre\". The two fought and Bizarro was impaled but survived to fight Clark again. With the sage advice of Martian Manhunter, Kal-El learnt that though Kryptonite makes Bizarro more powerful the sun makes him weaker. So Kal-El and the Martian Manhunter worked together to send Bizarro into the sun, where it is presumed he died.</p><p>In the book \" Last Days of Krypton\" Jor-El uses a series of crystals during a solar flare of the red sun Rao. He rips a hole in the space time continuum and after doing a test he gets sucked in. Eventually Lara comes in and finds Jor-El and helps her reverse the polarity of it and it shoots him out.</p>",

        "description":"Millennia ago, a group of &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kryptonians/65-45710/\">Kryptonians</a> left <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krypton/34-30670/\">Krypton</a> to&nbsp;wander the universe in exploration.&nbsp;An astronomer, Val-Or, discovered a distant sun (which was named after him).&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually journeying to Val-Or's star system, the explorer, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dax-am/29-65300/\">Dax-Am</a> (who also discovered Imsk, Durla and Schwar)&nbsp;founded the planet which was named after him. The Kryptonian colonists were able to mate with the natives and so interbred to create a new species, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daxamites/65-42480/\">Daxamites</a>.&nbsp;After several generations, the Daxamites forgot about their Kryptonian origins.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Eventually, Daxamites decided to expand in the universe.&nbsp;Young <b>Zax Vane</b> led a peaceful exploration to several worlds including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rann/34-55709/\">Rann</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/korugar/34-55818/\">Korugar </a>and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krypton/34-30670/\">Krypton</a>.&nbsp;During their exploration of the universe, the Daxamite explorers&nbsp;discovered they had great powers under a yellow sun.&nbsp;And, unlike Kryptonians, Daxamites could&nbsp;breed with some other humanoid races.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />One explorer, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bal-gand/29-66805/\">Bal Gand</a>, visited Earth and fell in love with Juyu, a native.&nbsp;They conceived a child and&nbsp;Gand left Earth,&nbsp;fearing what would might&nbsp;happen by&nbsp;raising a&nbsp;Daxamite baby&nbsp;in Earth's primitive culture.&nbsp; When&nbsp;Bal Gand returned to Daxam, she&nbsp;kept her ship ready for a return voyage to Earth, worried that her mixed-race child might not be accepted on Daxam.&nbsp;Bal Gand's&nbsp;descendants were born with a natural curiousity about the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Xenophobia grew strong in the other Daxamites, however.&nbsp;A Science War broke-out over the issue, and cost the lives of a quarter of the total population.&nbsp;Over the years, this fostered a&nbsp;Sorrow Cult, who feared all things alien. Over hundreds of years, their leader altered written history to omit the Science War and any relation to Krypton.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Young <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mon-el/29-21508/\">Lar Gand</a> and his friend Van discovered Bal Gand's old ship.&nbsp;The Sorrow Cult chased them, and Lar fled inside the ship, which followed its preprogrammed course back to Earth.&nbsp;While sleeping on the trip, Lar learned of Krypton, and when he arrived on Earth, his memory was clouded, and he believed he had come from Krypton, not Daxam.&nbsp;Lar was named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-El</a>, being mistaken for a Kryptonian by a young <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Clark Kent </a>who wished for Lar to be his brother from Krypton.&nbsp;When exposed to lead, however, Mon-El regained his memory, but Clark was forced to project him into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a> to save his life until a cure for the lead poisoning could be discovered.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ion/29-46185/\">Sodam Yat </a>grew up on&nbsp;Daxam as well.&nbsp;This was a tough life for&nbsp;Sodam who was interested in space and alien life. This also brought him into conflict with his parents. When he was about 8 years old he&nbsp;nursed a crashed alien back to health and the two became close friends.&nbsp;When his parents found out, the alien was captured and killed.&nbsp;Sodam's parents put him&nbsp;through psychiatric conditioning to help him get over his fascination with space.&nbsp;This worked until Sodam took a trip the museum, where he saw his alien friend stuffed and made to look evil. From then on,&nbsp;he put on an act&nbsp;for his parents, but he spent his spare time rebuilding his friend's spaceship.&nbsp;The day that he was&nbsp;going to leave Daxam,&nbsp;was the day he was offered a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">Power Ring</a> to join&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. \n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The people of Daxam encountered earthlings during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invasion/49-4197/\">Invasion</a>&nbsp;event, when a number of alien worlds took an interest in Earth for it\u2019s propensity to breed numerous super-powered beings. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dominators/65-56539/\">Dominators</a>, looking to create an army for their own purposes, contacted the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gildishpan/65-42479/\">Gil\u2019Dishpan</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/khunds/65-18273/\">Khunds</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanagarians/65-31019/\">Thanagarians</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/durlan/65-42477/\">Durlans</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/okaara/34-53799/\">Okaarans</a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psions/65-56376/\">Psions</a>, and the&nbsp;Daxamites. &nbsp;All species agreed to invade Earth, except the Daxamites who sent an observation team, refusing to take part in any of the fighting.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Once the invasion force had invaded&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/australia/34-55838/\">Australia</a>, the Daxamite&nbsp;group began to exhibit their yellow-sun activated powers.&nbsp;&nbsp;The seven of them attacked&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>, beating him nearly senseless. They fought for several minutes but being exposed to the high contents of lead in Earth\u2019s atmosphere left the Daxamites dying. Only the quick thinking of Superman saved them.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>The Daxamites&nbsp;realized they were on the wrong side. One of them, Kel Gand,&nbsp;sacrificed himself&nbsp;to radio the other&nbsp;Daxamites to involve itself in this unjust invasion. Many&nbsp;Daxamite vessels intercepted the Alliance&nbsp;warships and attacked, using their new found powers.&nbsp;They turned the tide of the invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />During the war with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperiex/29-10006/\">Imperiex</a>, Daxam was&nbsp;attacked by dozens of Imperiex Probes, which were responsible for killing hundreds of Daxamites. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\">Justice Society of America </a>and others, traveled to Daxam and liberated the planet without suffering a single lose of life. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Later, Daxam was taken over by the galactic despot known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mongul/29-12162/\">Mongul</a>. Armed with a handful of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps-ring/18-53415/\">Yellow Power Rings</a>, Mongul made Daxam the new base of operations for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Sinestro Corps</a>.&nbsp;Green Lanterns <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arisia/29-2046/\">Arisia </a>and Sodam Yat&nbsp;flew to Daxam to&nbsp;save the people from Mongul.&nbsp;Sodam realized&nbsp;the only way to save Daxam was to get&nbsp;the people to fight for themselves.&nbsp;Sodam flew into Daxam's red sun and infused it with the power of&nbsp; Ion,&nbsp;changing it from a red sun into a yellow sun. This act&nbsp;gave the Daxamites their inherent&nbsp;super-powers. It seemingly cost&nbsp;Sodam Yat his life, but the people of Daxam now had the power to defend themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3><u>The Future of Daxam&nbsp;<br /></u></h3>By the latter part of the 30th Century, Daxam's sun is once&nbsp;again&nbsp;red.&nbsp;It is not as yet, known when or how this happened.&nbsp;It also appears that the major Xenophobia that the&nbsp;people&nbsp;once had is now gone.&nbsp;In fact, Daxam is considered to be the leaders in the field of xenobiology.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Once the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes </a>formed, one of their members, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colu/34-56505/\">Colu</a>, was&nbsp;able to come&nbsp;up with a cure for&nbsp;Daxamite lead poisoning.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;after being forced into exile in the Phantom Zone for approximately 1000 years, Mon-El was freed.&nbsp;Mon-El was possibly the most powerful member of the Legion,&nbsp;and brought great pride to Daxam.&nbsp;When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Lightning Lad </a>gave his life fighting Zaryan the Conqueror,&nbsp;Mon-El went to Daxam to&nbsp;try to find&nbsp;a way to bring Lightning Lad back to life.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Later, during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\">Great Darkness Saga</a>,&nbsp;Mon-El faced the&nbsp;Master of the&nbsp;darkness&nbsp;alone.&nbsp; The master, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>, defeated Mon-El, putting him into a coma.&nbsp;Darkseid&nbsp;learned of Daxam from Mon-El's mind, and use his god-like powers to switch the locations of Daxam&nbsp;and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apokolips/34-41470/\">Apokolips</a>,&nbsp;putting Daxam under Apokolips' yellow sun.&nbsp;The Daxamite's were enslaved under Darkseid's control, and he forced them to use their heat vision to&nbsp;burn the planet, carving it into Darkseid's image.&nbsp;It took&nbsp;all of the Legion, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a>, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heroes-of-lallor/65-47188/\">Heroes of Lallor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wanderers/65-47418/\">The Wanderers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dev-em/29-27239/\">Dev-Em</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/science-police/65-23409/\">Science Police </a>to fight off the Daxamite's and defeat Darkseid.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It took month's of recovery.&nbsp;The Legion helped repair the world of Daxam, but even though the Daxamite's were mind controlled, the people of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/united-planets/65-56731/\">United Planet's </a>still look at them with a llittle fear.<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong><u>Native Powers&nbsp;</u><br /></strong>Possessed of genome similar to that of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kryptonians/65-45710/\">Kryptonians</a>, modified by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eradicator/29-5377/\">Eradicator</a>, become deathly ill when exposed to lead.&nbsp; Thus, the people of Daxam rarely leave their home planet.&nbsp;The Daxamites, when exposed to the radiant light of a yellow sun gain powers and abilities similar to that of Superman, including super strength, flight, near-invulnerability, super-senses, super-speed, arctic breath, heat vision and x-ray vision.&nbsp;Unlike Kryptonians, Daxamites can breed with other species. \n</p>",

It had many names: Avernus, Gehenna, Tartarus, Hades, Abaddon, Sheol... It was an inferno of pain and flame and ice, where every nightmare had come true long since. It was not considered a pleasant place by the majority of its inhabitants; however being dead, and being there (as they imagined) against their will, their opinions counted for little. And indeed, had Hell been pleasant, they would have felt cheated: they were there for pain, for suffering, for torment. Which they received in abundance. The other inhabitants of this place were not dead; however, neither were they alive, in any biological sense of the word. Humanity called them demons without understanding what it had named. There was little that demonkind had in common with the legions of damned souls with whom they shared the infernal marches. However, they were all agreed on one thing. This was as bad as it got. It couldn't get any worse.\"</i> -Excerpt taken from Neil Gaiman's, <i>The Sandman</i> #22.</p><p>This series is where the Hell that became famous throughout DC and Vertigo comics of the 90's began, in Issue 4 of the Sandman, Dream is forced to go to Hell to retrieve his helm. It is that Hell which was continuously used through many comics, usually just cameo appearances, until it met its end in Lucifer. The Hell was a place of many wonders, from the forest of suicides, to the cells where those cursed by the \"gods\" were kept. From the demons that lived within it, to the Damned that were tormented forever, it was quite a complicated place.</p><p>Another thing about this Hell is there was an entire monarchy, and unlike it most universes, Lucifer/Satan/The Devil was not the sole ruler of Hell, yes he was one of them, but it was a Triumvirate and Azazel and Belial ruled at his sides, splitting the kingdom in three. Eventually in the series however, Lucifer grows tired of ruling over Hell and retires, emptying the realm and passing on the key to Dream who then is met with numerous contenders for the possession of the Key. In the final end he is forced to give it to Duma and Remiel by order of Yahweh and the two angels are left to rule over it, though they try to distance themselves from the scum that inhabits the realm. This is the Hell that is met in Sandman's successor, Lucifer.</p><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lucifer/29-24232/\">Lucifer Morningstar</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dream/29-11171/\">Dream</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/duma/29-13456/\">Duma</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remiel/29-13457/\">Remiel</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nada/29-58057/\">Nada</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon/29-7367/\">Etrigan</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/choronzon/29-57621/\">Choronzon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/azazel/29-44486/\">Azazel</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/belial/29-30480/\">Belial</a></li></ul><h3>The Books of Magic (1990)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tim-hunter/29-23215/\">Tim Hunter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-occult/29-11291/\">Doctor Occult</a></li></ul><h3>The Demon (1990-1995)</h3><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon/29-7367/\">Etrigan</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lucifer/29-24232/\">Lucifer Morningstar</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beelzebub/29-53004/\">Beelzebub</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/merlin/29-5335/\">Merlin</a></li><li><a>Belial</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morax/29-53417/\">Morax</a></li></ul><h3>Kid Eternity (1991)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/kid-eternity/29-9363/\">Kid Eternity</a></li><li><a href=\"/jerry-sullivan/29-68589/\">Jerry Sullivan</a></li><li><a href=\"/mr-keeper/29-35415/\">Mr. Keeper</a></li></ul><h3>The Spectre (1992-1998)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1388116\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1388116-85893_137712_booster_gold_super.jpg\" title=\"Shathan: Lord of Lies\"><img id=\"1388116\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1388116-85893_137712_booster_gold_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Shathan: Lord of Lies\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shathan: Lord of Lies</div></div></div></div><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spectre/29-2361/\">Spectre</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/duma/29-13456/\">Duma</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remiel/29-13457/\">Remiel</a></li><li><a href=\"/shathan/29-15844/\">Shathan</a></li></ul><h3>The Phantom Stranger (1993)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/phantom-stranger/29-3298/\">Phantom Stranger</a></li><li><a href=\"/naamah/29-78936/\">Naamah</a></li><li><a href=\"/ashe/29-78935/\">Ashe</a></li></ul><h3>The Books of Magic (1994-2000)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molly/29-22507/\">Molly</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimple/29-25442/\">Crimple</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vuall/29-25443/\">Vuall</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tanger/29-25444/\">Tanger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lacewing/29-63863/\">Lacewing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/leatherwing/29-63864/\">Leatherwing</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/happy/29-50913/\">Happy</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tim-hunter/29-23215/\">Tim Hunter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toll/29-63960/\">Toll</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barbatos/29-22502/\">Barbatos</a></li><li><a href=\"/brother-hugh/29-22516/\">Brother Hugh</a></li></ul><h3>House of Secrets (1996-1998)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/rain-harper/29-23817/\">Rain Harper</a></li><li><a href=\"/amazing-zandar/29-70514/\">Amazing Zandar</a></li><li><a href=\"/erik-rylander/29-68485/\">Erik Rylander</a></li><li><a href=\"/peeters/29-70953/\">Peeters</a></li></ul><h3>Preacher Special: Saint of Killers (1996)</h3><p>When we first see this Hell it is being run by two down-and-out \"deities\" playing poker, The Devil and The Angel of Death. Things take a turn for the worse when the burning fires of Hell die out and in their place comes a cold, harsh winter...the Saint's hatred-filled soul had just entered the Gates. The Devil couldn't allow this to stand and he went to the Saint, he whipped the Saint for hours and hours, trying to beat the hatred out of his soul but to no avail, the Saint couldn't stop hating and so Hell was temporarily out of order. The Angel of Death came to a solution, and had his sword melted down into guns and the Saint became the new Angel of Death and as he left Hell, the inferno returned. The Devil shouted his relief (and insulted the Saint) only to get shot through the head, leaving this restored Hell without a devil to watch over it. How this impacted the realm was never shown.</p><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-devil/29-41630/\">The Devil</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saint-of-killers/29-10522/\">Saint of Killers</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel-of-death/29-24899/\">The Angel of Death</a></li></ul><h3>Sandman Presents: Lucifer (1999)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lucifer/29-24232/\">Lucifer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/duma/29-13456/\">Duma</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remiel/29-13457/\">Remiel</a></li></ul><h3>Lucifer (2000-2006)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/duma/29-13456/\">Duma</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remiel/29-13457/\">Remiel</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lucifer/29-24232/\">Lucifer</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/noema/29-50337/\">Noema</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jill-presto/29-50353/\">Jill Presto</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elaine-belloc/29-21000/\">Elaine Belloc</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mazikeen/29-44488/\">Mazikeen</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/berim/29-57176/\">Berim</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/christopher-rudd/29-50336/\">Christopher Rudd</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-lys/29-55897/\">Lady Lys</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lord-arux/29-56464/\">Lord Arux</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/duke-seviram/29-55999/\">Duke Seviram</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amenadiel/29-55845/\">Amenadiel</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/garamas/29-56516/\">Garamas</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gyges/29-57163/\">Gyges</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/effrul/29-57435/\">Effrul</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charlie-gilmour/29-57157/\">Charlie Gilmour</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brosag/29-57776/\">Brosag</a></li><li><a href=\"/sisyphus/29-57224/\">Sisyphus</a></li><li><a href=\"/duke-cloy/29-69519/\">Duke Cloy</a></li><li><a href=\"/duke-durovallis/29-69518/\">Duke Durovallis</a></li><li><a href=\"/virtus/29-69145/\">Virtus</a></li></ul><h3>Swamp Thing (2004-2006)</h3><p><b>List of Rulers, Inhabitants and Visitors</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/josephine/29-56600/\">Josephine</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anton-arcane/29-21065/\">Anton Arcane</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brother-walker/29-4934/\">Brother Walker</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/worm/29-4932/\">Worm</a></li></ul><h3>Constantine -

Springfield is perceived to be located in middle America. However, in some episodes they show Springfield near a very large body of water. Springfield is also surrounded by some mountains and is near a giant gorge. Shelbyville is the neighboring city, and the \"Capital City of the state\" is called \"Capital City\", and is also located near Springfield. In the Simpsons movie, it is revealed that the four states bordering Springfield are <a href=\"/ohio/34-55742/\">Ohio</a>, <a href=\"/nevada/34-55779/\">Nevada</a>, <a href=\"/kentucky/34-56116/\">Kentucky</a>, and <a href=\"/maine/34-55889/\">Maine</a>, Making it's location a majority of the United States.</p><h2>Residents</h2><p><b>742 Evergreen Terrace</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/homer-simpson/29-3399/\">Homer Simpson</a></li><li><a href=\"/marge-simpson/29-3400/\">Marge Simpson</a></li><li><a href=\"/bart-simpson/29-3401/\">Bart Simpson</a></li><li><a href=\"/lisa-simpson/29-3402/\">Lisa Simpson</a></li><li><a href=\"/maggie-simpson/29-3403/\">Maggie Simpson</a></li></ul><p><b>The Flanders' House</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/ned-flanders/29-8854/\">Ned Flanders</a></li><li><a href=\"/maude-flanders/29-8935/\">Maude Flanders</a></li><li><a href=\"/todd-flanders/29-8899/\">Todd Flanders</a></li><li><a href=\"/rod-flanders/29-8898/\">Rod Flanders</a></li></ul><p><b>Powers' House</b></p><ul><li>Ruth Powers</li><li>Laura Powers</li></ul><p><b>Springfield Nuclear Power Plant</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/mr-burns/29-8938/\">Mr. Burns</a></li><li><a href=\"/waylon-smithers/29-8902/\">Waylon Smithers</a></li><li>Charlie</li><li><a href=\"/lenny/29-8907/\">Lenny</a></li><li><a href=\"/carl/29-8892/\">Carl</a></li></ul><p><b>The Merchants</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/comic-book-guy/29-8856/\">Comic Book Guy</a></li><li><a href=\"/gil/29-8857/\">Gil</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-frink/29-8888/\">Professor Frink</a></li><li><a href=\"/dr-hibbert/29-8934/\">Dr. Hibbert</a></li><li><a href=\"/captain-mccallister/29-8956/\">Captain McCallister</a></li><li><a href=\"/apu-nahasapeemapetilon/29-8855/\">Apu Nahasapeemapetilon</a></li><li><a href=\"/dr-nick-riviera/29-8884/\">Dr. Nick Riviera</a></li><li><a href=\"/disco-stu/29-8980/\">Disco Stu</a></li><li><a href=\"/moe-szyslak/29-8865/\">Moe Szyslak</a></li><li><a href=\"/lionel-hutz/29-46353/\">Lionel Hutz</a></li></ul><p><b>Springfield Elementary Staff &amp;

It also seems to be partially responsible for the ability of DC residents to develop super-powers, especially those which defy physics. Lying at the edge of the known universe in the Promethean Galaxy is the Source Wall, which protects the Source, and traps all those who attempt to pass beyond it. Very few have interacted with it outside of <a href=\"/highfather/29-5324/\">         Highfather</a> of the New Gods; therefore, not much is known concretely about its many aspects.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1328473\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1328473-00_steel_harbor_super.jpg\" title=\"Superman and Darkseid at the Source Wall\"><img id=\"1328473\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1328473-00_steel_harbor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Superman and Darkseid at the Source Wall\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Superman and Darkseid at the Source Wall</div></div></div></div><p>Now that the DC Universe is revealed to be 52 universes it is stated that each reality has a Source Wall separating it from the others with The Bleed in between them. <a href=\"/superman-prime/29-40756/\">         Superman-Prime</a> managed to destroy a Source Wall causing the destruction of Earth-15.

The other being evolved into the Anti-Life entity. In retribution, the Source destroyed the Old Gods and created the New Gods. However, its diminished state caused the New Gods to be flawed. The Source seeks to reunite with its other half and start anew.

        "description":"<h2>Madripoor</h2><p>Madripoor is a small island nation in Indonesian archipelago. Like <a href=\"/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>, Madripoor was a sanctuary for pirates many years ago. In fact the pirate ethic has shaped Madripoor's history and society. Its recently deceased ruler, <a href=\"/prince-baran/29-60536/\">Prince Baran</a>, was descended from the freebooters who settled on the island and founded the country. Just as Madripoor's rulers tolerated piracy in the past, its government today has a relaxed policy toward most business dealings that do not threaten the regime's stability. As a result, Madripoor has become one of the business capitals of the Pacific Rim. However, it is also a notorious center for crime, especially the narcotics trade and slavery. Since Madripoor does not permit other nations to extradite criminals, the island has become a refuge for international crime lords and criminal organizations, who make payoffs to the government to ensure good relations.</p><h2>Tale of Two Cities</h2><p>The capital of Madripoor, also named Madripoor, is divided in two. Madripoor Hightown is one of the worlds wealthiest areas, populated by rich and powerful. Its spectacular architecture and advanced technology make it truly a city of the 21st century. However, Madripoor Lowtown is one of the most impoverished areas in the world. Lowtown is a throwback to the lawlessness of a thousand years ago: a place of rampant crime and depravity where anything can be bought. Yet certain places, such as <a href=\"http://url.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>'s Princess Bar, have a certain rough charm reminiscent of the exotic settings of old movies.</p><h2>Princess Bar</h2><p>Amid the squalor of Lowtown, the Princess Bar is an oasis of elegance and style. Frightened by Lowtown's dangerous reputation, tourist avoid the Princess Bar after dark. At night, it becomes a gathering place for local residents from both Hightown and Lowtown. The Princess Bar is also a fine restaurant with cabaret entertainment.</p><p>The bar takes its name from a woman nicknamed 'Princess' who was somehow connected with its previous owner, a mysterious Englishman known as O'Donnell, who is now dead.

        "description":"<p>Limbo is sometimes referred to as \"Otherplace\" and it is a pocket dimension where the laws of nature are mainly magic. Its appearance is that of a solid land where gravity still has a hold but the sky suffers from an absence of stars. The general landscape changes with each ruler usually very mountainous terrain.</p><p>Limbo is first shown in Uncanny X-men #160, when its ruler <a href=\"/belasco/29-10947/\">Belasco</a> kidnaps Illyana Rasputin to Limbo and when the X-men rescue her, she is seemingly aged several years. In reality, during the moments they lost her grasp, those several years really passed for her, such is the magic of time in Limbo.</p><p>Those that dwell within its boundaries are a vast variety of demons of all shapes and sizes who all have some sort of magical skill. Time is peculiar in this dimension as the present is non-existent and can only be stated to be so by an individual. Limbo is also spotted by magical \"stepping discs\" which travel through time as well as space allowing a traveler, if he or she could control them, to be anywhere, anywhen instantly. As an adolescent, Illyana developed the mutant ability to control these discs, giving her a natural affinity to Limbo. The farther the jump in time or space she tried to make with the discs though, the less accurate she was able to be.</p><p>The beings of Limbo will blindly serve their master who is most commonly a Supreme Sorcerer, but if not kept in check they may betray their overlord or plague other realities. The appearance of Limbo can change quite drastically based on whatever its ruler fancies or even sometimes based on their unconscious desires.</p><p>Also, if a human enters Limbo it is considered inevitable that eventually they shall gain demonic physical aspects (i.e. horns, tails, hooves, etc) and though this transformation will give them mastery over sorcery it typically costs the person their souls (examples are <a href=\"/magik/29-8303/\">Magik</a> and the <a href=\"/bogeyman/29-3131/\">Bogeyman</a></p><p>Limbo is kept alive by what appears to be a giant animal heart hidden deep beneath its surface in a cavern. But truthfully it is simply a small deposit of <a href=\"/promethium/18-55689/\">promethium</a> that would cause Limbo to disappear if it was removed.</p><p><a href=\"/magik/29-8303/\">Magik</a>'s <a href=\"/soulsword/18-42991/\">Soulsword</a> has become a symbol of the ruler of Limbo.</p><h2>Rulers of Limbo</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/belasco/29-10947/\">Belasco</a>: He is not as savage as the other demons and has a more human appearance, perhaps meaning that he was once human, he is the longest-running known ruler of Limbo and recently tried to claim it as his own again and kidnapped the students at the Xavier Institute but this attempt was halted.</p><p><a href=\"/witchfire/29-26481/\">Witchfire</a>: The daughter of Limbo's former ruler Belasco. She recently tried to claim her fathers place at the Hell Lords' table by taking over Limbo for herself. She was defeated by the newly resurrected Magik and the New X-men team. She is currently trapped in the Elder God's dimension along with several Bloodstones.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a>: She was kidnapped by Belasco as a child and after learning from him she eventually overthrew him to become the ruler of Limbo. She has the ability to leave at will but chose to rule it instead, until she died of the Legacy Virus. She has recently returned when Belasco tried to reclaim Limbo and has now retaken the throne.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sym/29-10291/\">Sym</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nastirh/29-42869/\">N'astirh</a>: These two were of the greatest demons inhabiting Limbo, S'ym being the master of physical power and N'astirh of magical power. The two became servants of Belasco and then Illyana but betrayed Illyana after her temporary absence. They then crossed into Earth where they wreaked havoc after fooling Illyana into making a permanent portal into the Earthly realm (see <a href=\"/inferno/39-41408/\">Inferno</a>). N'astirh died int his attempt and S'ym was later killed by Darkoth. They were recently seen as the servants of Illyana yet again now that she has retaken the throne, but this has been left unexplained.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>: Victor von Doom temporarily took over Limbo when he wished to steal its source, the deposit of promethium, which he wished to use to permanently power his Earthly nation of Latveria.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkoth/29-14514/\">Darkoth</a>: Darkoth ruled Limbo for an unknown period of time and at this time also possessed the Soulsword that he had taken from Doctor Doom.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/margali-szardos/29-23007/\">Margali Szardos</a>: She stole the Soulsword from Kitty Pryde so that she could become the greatest follower of The Winding Way and also used it to take over Limbo.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amanda-sefton/29-10970/\">Amanda Sefton</a>: Jimaine Szardos took the Soulsword from her mother and became the ruler of Limbo for some time, taking the name Magik as Illyana had before her. She eventually lost control of Limbo when Belasco banished her, after Illyana regained control she found she was unable to return to Limbo.</p>",

Not even extremely advanced technology, such as the Negation's tracking devices, can locate it.

She stated that you must imagine yourself in the center of all creation when teleporting in order to even have a chance of arriving on Elysia.
