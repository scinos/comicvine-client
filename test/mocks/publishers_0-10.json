        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>DC was founded in 1934 under the name of National Allied Publications. DC was formed by the merging of National Allied Publications and Detective Comics. The Company changed it's name as a result of its nickname: DC Comics. People had nicknamed it DC because of one its most popular comic series; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a> It is perhaps the world's most recognizable comic companies and rivals <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> publishing.</p><p>DC Comics has its official headquarters at 1700 Broadway, 7th, New York, New York. Random House distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comics Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1837076\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58424/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large_super.jpg\" title=\"Justice League # 1\"><img id=\"1837076\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58424/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Justice League # 1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Justice League # 1</div></div></div></div><p>National Allied Publications' first comic was <i>New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1</i> which was released in the February of 1935. It hit off, and was surprisingly popular. Later that year, a second title was released: <i>New Comics #1.</i> The size and length <i>New Comics #1</i> became the archetype for many comics afterwards, and it became the longest running comic series of all time.</p><p>With the establishment of DC as the major comic book company and with many of the most marketable names in the early years of comics, it became the main company that other companies tried to compete with. Companies tried different approaches, for instance <a href=\"/fawcett-publications/57-34/\">Fawcett Publications</a> tried to copy the formula of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> and to have an all-powerful hero with a supporting \"family\", whereas other companies such as <a href=\"/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a> created entire new worlds. Further along in the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a> many of these companies failed and either DC or Marvel bought the rights to the characters. Thus although they had once been competitors the properties of Fawcett and Charlton both eventually came under DC's control.</p><p>With the reinvigoration of Marvel in the 1960s under the leadership of <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, DC found itself a new and more potent competitor. Marvel succeeded by breaking what had become by then generic archetypes of superheroes by introducing characters which were younger and more flawed (and thus appeared more human and appealed to a younger crowd in a more direct manner.) After falling behind Marvel in sales, DC was finally forced to adopt much of the same system which Marvel had, by introducing such young teams as the <a href=\"/teen-titans/65-19081/\">Teen Titans</a> to compete with the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>.</p><p>With the same concept in mind, in 2011, DC announced they were cancelling all the main titles and starting over with all <a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">New 52's</a> as part of a relaunch. In charge of the relaunch is <a href=\"/geoff-johns/26-40439/\">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href=\"/jim-lee/26-2399/\">Jim Lee</a>. The relaunch started with the release of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-justice-league-part-one/37-290431/\">Justice League # 1</a> on August 31st. this was done partially to revitalize the company and to deage the characters and thus make them more dynamic. On January 12, 2012, it was announced that there would be a second wave of the new 52 where six titles would be getting canceled with another six to replace them, though the plan to stay at 52 ongoing monthlies seems to be consistent.</p><p>DC comics now has 28 live action movies, 16 animated films (in all likely hood more), 42 television series's and 39 video games based on the DC universe. <b>DC Imprints and Sub-Imprints Both Past and Present</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vertigo/57-521/\">Vertigo</a> (1993-Present)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildstorm/57-708/\">WildStorm</a> (1999-2010)*</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cmx/57-2345/\">CMX</a> (2004-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helix/57-602/\">Helix</a> (1996-1998)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/2000ad/57-2358/\">2000AD</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/americas-best-comics/57-731/\">America's Best Comics</a> (1999-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cliffhanger/57-2287/\">Cliffhanger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tangent-comics/57-638/\">Tangent Comics</a> (1997-2008)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradox-press/57-1982/\">Paradox Press</a> (1993-2001)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/piranha-press/57-2083/\">Piranha Press</a> (1989-1994)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/humanoids/57-1346/\">Humanoids</a> (2004)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/milestone/57-538/\">Milestone</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/impact/57-483/\">Impact!</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/minx/57-2227/\">Minx</a> (2007-2008)</li><li><a href=\"/zuda-comics/57-2069/\">Zuda</a> (2007-2010)</li></ul><p>*the imprint was founded in 1992 but as part of the <a href=\"/image/57-513/\">Image</a> conglomerate and only moved to DC in 1999</p><h2>DC Movies (Cinematic Releases)</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-the-movie/223-55/\">Batman: The Movie</a> (July 30, 1966)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/223-2/\">Superman</a> (December 15, 1978)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-ii/223-5/\">Superman II</a> (June 19, 1981)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-iii/223-6/\">Superman III</a> (June 17, 1983)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supergirl/223-171/\">Supergirl</a> (November 21, 1984)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-iv-the-quest-for-peace/223-9/\">Superman IV: The Quest For Peace</a> (July 24, 1987)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/223-4/\">Batman</a> (June 23, 1989)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-returns/223-7/\">Batman Returns</a> (June 19, 1992)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-forever/223-8/\">Batman Forever</a> (June 16, 1995)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-robin/223-10/\">Batman &amp; Robin</a> (June 20, 1997)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen/223-28/\">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> (June 11, 2003)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/constantine/223-26/\">Constantine</a> (February 18, 2005)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-begins/223-12/\">Batman Begins</a> (June 14, 2005)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-returns/223-11/\">Superman Returns</a> (June 28, 2006)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-knight/223-15/\">The Dark Knight</a> (July 18, 2008)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watchmen/223-1/\">Watchmen</a> (March 19, 2009)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern/223-926/\">Green Lantern</a> (June 17, 2011)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-knight-rises/223-1214/\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (July 20, 2012)</li></ul><h4>Coming Attractions (Cinematic Releases)</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-of-steel/223-1375/\">Man of Steel</a> (June 14, 2013)</li></ul>",

        "description":"<p><b>Fox Feature Syndicate</b> (also known as <b>Fox Comics</b> and <b>Fox Publications</b>) was a comic book publisher from early in the period known to fans and historians as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age of Comic Books</a>. Founded by entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/victor-fox/26-49436/\">Victor A. Fox</a>, it produced such titles as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-blue-beetle/49-19402/\">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-comics/49-19504/\">Fantastic Comics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystery-men-comics/49-20530/\">Mystery Men Comics</a>.</p><p>It is unrelated to the company Fox Publications, a Colorado publisher of railroad photography books.</p><p>Victor A. Fox and business associate Bob Farrell launched Fox Feature Syndicate at 480 Lexington Avenue in New York City in the late 1930s. For content, Fox contracted with comics packager <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/will-eisner/26-26686/\">Eisner</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/s-m-jerry-iger/26-41635/\">Iger</a>, one of a handful of companies creating comic books on demand for publishers entering the field. Writer-artist Will Eisner, at Victor Fox's request for a hero to mimic the newly created hit Superman, created the superhero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-73295/\">Wonder Man</a> for Fox's first publication, Wonder Comics #1 (May 1939), signing his work \"Willis\". Superman owner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/national-periodical-publications/57-24/\">National Periodical Publications</a>, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, cited copyright infringement and quickly obtained a permanent injunction. Wonder Man did not reappear.</p><p>After Eisner testified against Fox Publications at trial, Victor Fox dropped the packager and hired his own stable of comic creators, beginning with a New York Times classified ad on Dec. 2, 1939. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joe-simon/26-9443/\">Joe Simon</a>, a former Eisner &amp; Iger freelancer, became Fox Publications' editor.</p><p>As one of the earliest companies in the emerging field, it employed or bought the packaged material of a huge number of Golden Age greats, many at the start of their careers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lou-fine/26-24756/\">Lou Fine</a> created the superhero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-flame/29-24757/\">The Flame</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonderworld-comics/49-20532/\">Wonderworld Comics</a>; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dick-briefer/26-43461/\">Dick Briefer</a> created <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rex-dexter/29-17833/\">Rex Dexter of Mars</a> in the eponymous series. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/george-tuska/26-9435/\">George Tuska</a> did his first comics work here with the features \"Zanzibar\" (Mystery Men Comics #1, Aug. 1939) and \"Tom Barry\" (Wonderworld Comics #4). <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fletcher-hanks/26-56582/\">Fletcher Hanks</a> wrote and drew <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stardust-the-super-wizard/29-27007/\">Stardust the Super Wizard</a> in Fantastic Comics in 1939 and 1940. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-baker/26-27899/\">Matt Baker</a>, one of the few African-American comic book artists of the Golden Age, revamped \u2014 in more than one sense \u2014 the newly acquired Quality Comics character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-lady/49-26918/\">Phantom Lady</a>' in 1947, creating one of the most memorable and controversial examples of superhero \"good girl art\".</p><p>Future comics legend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, brought on staff here after freelancing for Eisner &amp; Iger, wrote and drew the syndicated newspaper comic strip The Blue Beetle (starting Jan. 1940), starring a character created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charles-nicholas/26-39294/\">Charles Nicholas Wojtkowski</a> in Mystery Men Comics #1 (Aug. 1939). Kirby retained the house name \"Charles Nicholas\" for the comic strip, which lasted three months. Kirby, additionally, created and did one story each of the Fox features \"Wing Turner\" (Mystery Men #10, May 1940) and \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-carson/29-73810/\">Cosmic Carson</a>\" (Science Comics #4, same month).</p><p>Throughout the 1940s, Fox produced comics in a typically wide variety of genres, but was best known for superheroes and humor. With the post-war decline in superheroes' popularity, Fox, like other publishers, concentrated on horror and crime comics, including some of the most notorious of the latter. Following the establishment of Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Fox went out of business, selling the rights to the Blue Beetle to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a>.</p><p>Born in England, Fox Publications founder Victor A. Fox was a stockbroker for the Allied Capital Corp./Fox Motor and Bank Stocks, Inc./American Common Stocks, Inc., on Park Avenue in New York City when he was [indicted citation needed] on Nov. 27, 1929 for mail fraud and related illegal \"boiler room\" activities. It appears unrecorded whether this resulted in a conviction.</p><p>Historian Jon Berk has written that Fox went on to become an accountant/bookkeeper at the publishing firm that would become DC Comics, where he was privy to sales figures that convinced him to launch his own comic-book company. Fellow historian Gerard Jones, writing in his book Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book, was unable to find documentation of this. Other sources say that at the time Action Comics # 1 came out he was publishing Astrology magazines and thought he could make more money doing comics, or more to the point a copy of Superman.</p><p><b>Jack Kirby</b>: \"Victor Fox was a character. He'd look up at the ceiling with a big cigar, this little fellow, very broad, going back and forth with his hands behind his back saying, 'I'm the King of Comics! I'm the King of Comics!' and we would watch him and, of course, smile a little because he was a genuine type\".</p><p><b>Joe Simon</b> on Victor Fox : \"He was an accountant for DC Comics. He was doing the sales figures and he liked what he saw. So, he moved downstairs and started his own company.... I happened to get a job; I went over to Fox and became editor there, which was just an impossible job, because ... there were no artists, no writers, no editors, no letterers \u2014 nothing there. Everything came out of the Eisner and Iger shop. ... He was a very strange character. He had kind of a British accent; he was like 5'2\", told us he was a former ballroom dancer. He was very loud, menacing, and really a scary little guy. He used to say, 'I'm the King of the Comics. I'm the King of the Comics. I'm the King of the Comics.' We couldn't stop him\".</p><p><b>Nicky Wright</b>: \"Competing well in the 'most sexy, sadistic, and violent' category, Victor Fox\u2019s Murder Incorporated and Blue Beetle are noteworthy.... When historians describe sleaze, sex, and violence as Fox\u2019s obsession, they are masters of understatement. His best artists, Jack Kamen and Matt Baker, are much revered and collected for their good girl art. (Of special note is the company\u2019s breasty crime-fighter-in-bedroom-lingerie, Phantom Lady...along with the wild and scantily attired Rulah, Jungle Goddess.)\"</p><p><b>Boyd Magers</b>: \"Never one to overlook a secondary sale, Fox often repackaged four remaindered (unsold) comics into a 25\u00a2 Giant with a new cover, hence Hoot Gibson's Western Roundup, 132 pages dated 1950. However, since Fox always started their stories on the inside front cover (where other publishers ran an ad), these repackaged comics are always missing the first page of story content. Also, since Fox used remaindered issues, contents will vary from copy to copy of Hoot Gibson's Western Roundup.\"</p><p>Dynamite Entertainment has revived a few of the Fox Feature Syndicate characters in their Project Superpowers title</p><p>A portion of the Stable of characters that were originally published were:</p><p>Ace and Dart</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-banshee/29-73801/\">The Banshee</a></p><p>The Bat Boy</p><p>Beau Brummel</p><p>Birdman</p><p>Blackbird</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-fury/29-73806/\">Black Fury and Kid Fury</a></p><p>Black Lion</p><p>Blitz</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle-garret/29-18745/\">Blue Beetle</a> (Holyoke, Charlton and later DC)</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-bouncer/29-75003/\">The Bouncer</a> and Sparky</p><p>Bronze Man</p><p>Captain Kidd</p><p>Captain V</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagar-desert-hawk/29-34228/\">Dagar, the Desert Hawk</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dart-ace/65-57404/\">Dart and Ace</a></p><p>Doctor Death</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dynamite-thor/29-73824/\">Dynamite Thor</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-eagle/29-18752/\">The Eagle and Buddy</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dynamo/29-20352/\">Electro ( late Dynamo)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-flame/29-24757/\">The Flame</a> and Flame Girl</p><p>Flip Falcon</p><p>Golden Knight</p><p>The Gorilla with the Human Brain</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-mask/29-51185/\">Green Mask</a> and Domino</p><p>The Hand</p><p>Illuso</p><p>Jaguar/Jaguar Man</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jo-jo-congo-king/49-19615/\">Jo Jo Congo King</a></p><p>Lunar the Moon Man</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-lynx/29-71660/\">The Lynx</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/panther-woman/29-69423/\">Marga the Panther Woman</a></p><p>The Mask</p><p>Miss X</p><p>Moth/Mothman</p><p>Nightbird</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-lady/49-26918/\">Phantom Lady</a> (obtained from Quality)</p><p>Professor Fiend</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purple-tigress/29-61284/\">Purple Tigress</a></p><p>Rani-Boy</p><p>The Rapier</p><p>The Raven</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rulah-jungle-goddess/49-21051/\">Rulah, Jungle Goddess</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/samson/29-52544/\">Samson</a></p><p>Sorceress of Zoom</p><p>Space Smith</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-queen/29-30223/\">Spider Queen</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stardust-the-super-wizard/29-27007/\">Stardust, the Super Wizard</a></p><p>Sub Saunders</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tangi/29-2377/\">Tangi</a></p><p>Tegra, the Jungle Princess</p><p>Thor</p><p>The Topper</p><p>Tumbler</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/us-jones/29-17039/\">U.S. Jones</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/v-man/29-8119/\">V-Man and the V-Boys</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-73295/\">Wonder Man</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-wraith/29-74160/\">The Wraith</a></p><p>Yank Wilson</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yarko-the-great/29-12801/\">Yarko, the Great</a></p><p>Zago, Jungle Prince</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rex-dexter/29-17833/\">Rex Dexter</a></p><p>Many of these characters have their separate page and others do not.

The Company was run by <a href=\"../../martin-goodman/26-43801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Martin Goodman</a>, established in 1939. Ironicly, the very first comic that Timely Comics published was named \"Marvel Comics\", the name that the company would later take on as their company-name. Timely Comics is famous for creating iconic comicbook characters who are still published to this very day, such as <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                 Captain America</a>, the<a href=\"../../jim-hammond/29-12605/\" rel=\"nofollow\">           Original Human Torch</a> and <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">         Namor</a>. The company published mostly super hero comics untill they no longer became profitabele in the late 1940's. In the 1950's the company changed it's name to <a href=\"../../atlas/57-75/\" rel=\"nofollow\">        Atlas</a>, publishing mostly Horror and Detective comics untill the early 1960's when the company again changed it's name. This time into <a href=\"../../marvel/57-31/\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Marvel</a> Comics, a name that would last and continues to build up on the foundations that where layed here by Timely Comics.",
