        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>DC was founded in 1934 under the name of National Allied Publications. DC was formed by the merging of National Allied Publications and Detective Comics. The Company changed it's name as a result of its nickname: DC Comics. People had nicknamed it DC because of one its most popular comic series; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a> It is perhaps the world's most recognizable comic companies and rivals <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> publishing.</p><p>DC Comics has its official headquarters at 1700 Broadway, 7th, New York, New York. Random House distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comics Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1837076\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58424/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large_super.jpg\" title=\"Justice League # 1\"><img id=\"1837076\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58424/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Justice League # 1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Justice League # 1</div></div></div></div><p>National Allied Publications' first comic was <i>New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1</i> which was released in the February of 1935. It hit off, and was surprisingly popular. Later that year, a second title was released: <i>New Comics #1.</i> The size and length <i>New Comics #1</i> became the archetype for many comics afterwards, and it became the longest running comic series of all time.</p><p>With the establishment of DC as the major comic book company and with many of the most marketable names in the early years of comics, it became the main company that other companies tried to compete with. Companies tried different approaches, for instance <a href=\"/fawcett-publications/57-34/\">Fawcett Publications</a> tried to copy the formula of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> and to have an all-powerful hero with a supporting \"family\", whereas other companies such as <a href=\"/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a> created entire new worlds. Further along in the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a> many of these companies failed and either DC or Marvel bought the rights to the characters. Thus although they had once been competitors the properties of Fawcett and Charlton both eventually came under DC's control.</p><p>With the reinvigoration of Marvel in the 1960s under the leadership of <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, DC found itself a new and more potent competitor. Marvel succeeded by breaking what had become by then generic archetypes of superheroes by introducing characters which were younger and more flawed (and thus appeared more human and appealed to a younger crowd in a more direct manner.) After falling behind Marvel in sales, DC was finally forced to adopt much of the same system which Marvel had, by introducing such young teams as the <a href=\"/teen-titans/65-19081/\">Teen Titans</a> to compete with the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>.</p><p>With the same concept in mind, in 2011, DC announced they were cancelling all the main titles and starting over with all <a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">New 52's</a> as part of a relaunch. In charge of the relaunch is <a href=\"/geoff-johns/26-40439/\">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href=\"/jim-lee/26-2399/\">Jim Lee</a>. The relaunch started with the release of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-justice-league-part-one/37-290431/\">Justice League # 1</a> on August 31st. this was done partially to revitalize the company and to deage the characters and thus make them more dynamic. On January 12, 2012, it was announced that there would be a second wave of the new 52 where six titles would be getting canceled with another six to replace them, though the plan to stay at 52 ongoing monthlies seems to be consistent.</p><p>DC comics now has 28 live action movies, 16 animated films (in all likely hood more), 42 television series's and 39 video games based on the DC universe. <b>DC Imprints and Sub-Imprints Both Past and Present</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vertigo/57-521/\">Vertigo</a> (1993-Present)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildstorm/57-708/\">WildStorm</a> (1999-2010)*</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cmx/57-2345/\">CMX</a> (2004-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helix/57-602/\">Helix</a> (1996-1998)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/2000ad/57-2358/\">2000AD</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/americas-best-comics/57-731/\">America's Best Comics</a> (1999-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cliffhanger/57-2287/\">Cliffhanger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tangent-comics/57-638/\">Tangent Comics</a> (1997-2008)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradox-press/57-1982/\">Paradox Press</a> (1993-2001)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/piranha-press/57-2083/\">Piranha Press</a> (1989-1994)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/humanoids/57-1346/\">Humanoids</a> (2004)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/milestone/57-538/\">Milestone</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/impact/57-483/\">Impact!</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/minx/57-2227/\">Minx</a> (2007-2008)</li><li><a href=\"/zuda-comics/57-2069/\">Zuda</a> (2007-2010)</li></ul><p>*the imprint was founded in 1992 but as part of the <a href=\"/image/57-513/\">Image</a> conglomerate and only moved to DC in 1999</p><h2>DC Movies (Cinematic Releases)</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-the-movie/223-55/\">Batman: The Movie</a> (July 30, 1966)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/223-2/\">Superman</a> (December 15, 1978)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-ii/223-5/\">Superman II</a> (June 19, 1981)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-iii/223-6/\">Superman III</a> (June 17, 1983)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supergirl/223-171/\">Supergirl</a> (November 21, 1984)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-iv-the-quest-for-peace/223-9/\">Superman IV: The Quest For Peace</a> (July 24, 1987)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/223-4/\">Batman</a> (June 23, 1989)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-returns/223-7/\">Batman Returns</a> (June 19, 1992)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-forever/223-8/\">Batman Forever</a> (June 16, 1995)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-robin/223-10/\">Batman &amp; Robin</a> (June 20, 1997)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen/223-28/\">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> (June 11, 2003)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/constantine/223-26/\">Constantine</a> (February 18, 2005)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-begins/223-12/\">Batman Begins</a> (June 14, 2005)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-returns/223-11/\">Superman Returns</a> (June 28, 2006)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-knight/223-15/\">The Dark Knight</a> (July 18, 2008)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watchmen/223-1/\">Watchmen</a> (March 19, 2009)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern/223-926/\">Green Lantern</a> (June 17, 2011)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-knight-rises/223-1214/\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (July 20, 2012)</li></ul><h4>Coming Attractions (Cinematic Releases)</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-of-steel/223-1375/\">Man of Steel</a> (June 14, 2013)</li></ul>",

        "description":"<p><b>Fox Feature Syndicate</b> (also known as <b>Fox Comics</b> and <b>Fox Publications</b>) was a comic book publisher from early in the period known to fans and historians as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age of Comic Books</a>. Founded by entrepreneur <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/victor-fox/26-49436/\">Victor A. Fox</a>, it produced such titles as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-blue-beetle/49-19402/\">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-comics/49-19504/\">Fantastic Comics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystery-men-comics/49-20530/\">Mystery Men Comics</a>.</p><p>It is unrelated to the company Fox Publications, a Colorado publisher of railroad photography books.</p><p>Victor A. Fox and business associate Bob Farrell launched Fox Feature Syndicate at 480 Lexington Avenue in New York City in the late 1930s. For content, Fox contracted with comics packager <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/will-eisner/26-26686/\">Eisner</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/s-m-jerry-iger/26-41635/\">Iger</a>, one of a handful of companies creating comic books on demand for publishers entering the field. Writer-artist Will Eisner, at Victor Fox's request for a hero to mimic the newly created hit Superman, created the superhero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-73295/\">Wonder Man</a> for Fox's first publication, Wonder Comics #1 (May 1939), signing his work \"Willis\". Superman owner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/national-periodical-publications/57-24/\">National Periodical Publications</a>, the company that would evolve into DC Comics, cited copyright infringement and quickly obtained a permanent injunction. Wonder Man did not reappear.</p><p>After Eisner testified against Fox Publications at trial, Victor Fox dropped the packager and hired his own stable of comic creators, beginning with a New York Times classified ad on Dec. 2, 1939. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joe-simon/26-9443/\">Joe Simon</a>, a former Eisner &amp; Iger freelancer, became Fox Publications' editor.</p><p>As one of the earliest companies in the emerging field, it employed or bought the packaged material of a huge number of Golden Age greats, many at the start of their careers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lou-fine/26-24756/\">Lou Fine</a> created the superhero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-flame/29-24757/\">The Flame</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonderworld-comics/49-20532/\">Wonderworld Comics</a>; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dick-briefer/26-43461/\">Dick Briefer</a> created <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rex-dexter/29-17833/\">Rex Dexter of Mars</a> in the eponymous series. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/george-tuska/26-9435/\">George Tuska</a> did his first comics work here with the features \"Zanzibar\" (Mystery Men Comics #1, Aug. 1939) and \"Tom Barry\" (Wonderworld Comics #4). <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fletcher-hanks/26-56582/\">Fletcher Hanks</a> wrote and drew <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stardust-the-super-wizard/29-27007/\">Stardust the Super Wizard</a> in Fantastic Comics in 1939 and 1940. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-baker/26-27899/\">Matt Baker</a>, one of the few African-American comic book artists of the Golden Age, revamped \u2014 in more than one sense \u2014 the newly acquired Quality Comics character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-lady/49-26918/\">Phantom Lady</a>' in 1947, creating one of the most memorable and controversial examples of superhero \"good girl art\".</p><p>Future comics legend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, brought on staff here after freelancing for Eisner &amp; Iger, wrote and drew the syndicated newspaper comic strip The Blue Beetle (starting Jan. 1940), starring a character created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charles-nicholas/26-39294/\">Charles Nicholas Wojtkowski</a> in Mystery Men Comics #1 (Aug. 1939). Kirby retained the house name \"Charles Nicholas\" for the comic strip, which lasted three months. Kirby, additionally, created and did one story each of the Fox features \"Wing Turner\" (Mystery Men #10, May 1940) and \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-carson/29-73810/\">Cosmic Carson</a>\" (Science Comics #4, same month).</p><p>Throughout the 1940s, Fox produced comics in a typically wide variety of genres, but was best known for superheroes and humor. With the post-war decline in superheroes' popularity, Fox, like other publishers, concentrated on horror and crime comics, including some of the most notorious of the latter. Following the establishment of Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Fox went out of business, selling the rights to the Blue Beetle to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a>.</p><p>Born in England, Fox Publications founder Victor A. Fox was a stockbroker for the Allied Capital Corp./Fox Motor and Bank Stocks, Inc./American Common Stocks, Inc., on Park Avenue in New York City when he was [indicted citation needed] on Nov. 27, 1929 for mail fraud and related illegal \"boiler room\" activities. It appears unrecorded whether this resulted in a conviction.</p><p>Historian Jon Berk has written that Fox went on to become an accountant/bookkeeper at the publishing firm that would become DC Comics, where he was privy to sales figures that convinced him to launch his own comic-book company. Fellow historian Gerard Jones, writing in his book Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book, was unable to find documentation of this. Other sources say that at the time Action Comics # 1 came out he was publishing Astrology magazines and thought he could make more money doing comics, or more to the point a copy of Superman.</p><p><b>Jack Kirby</b>: \"Victor Fox was a character. He'd look up at the ceiling with a big cigar, this little fellow, very broad, going back and forth with his hands behind his back saying, 'I'm the King of Comics! I'm the King of Comics!' and we would watch him and, of course, smile a little because he was a genuine type\".</p><p><b>Joe Simon</b> on Victor Fox : \"He was an accountant for DC Comics. He was doing the sales figures and he liked what he saw. So, he moved downstairs and started his own company.... I happened to get a job; I went over to Fox and became editor there, which was just an impossible job, because ... there were no artists, no writers, no editors, no letterers \u2014 nothing there. Everything came out of the Eisner and Iger shop. ... He was a very strange character. He had kind of a British accent; he was like 5'2\", told us he was a former ballroom dancer. He was very loud, menacing, and really a scary little guy. He used to say, 'I'm the King of the Comics. I'm the King of the Comics. I'm the King of the Comics.' We couldn't stop him\".</p><p><b>Nicky Wright</b>: \"Competing well in the 'most sexy, sadistic, and violent' category, Victor Fox\u2019s Murder Incorporated and Blue Beetle are noteworthy.... When historians describe sleaze, sex, and violence as Fox\u2019s obsession, they are masters of understatement. His best artists, Jack Kamen and Matt Baker, are much revered and collected for their good girl art. (Of special note is the company\u2019s breasty crime-fighter-in-bedroom-lingerie, Phantom Lady...along with the wild and scantily attired Rulah, Jungle Goddess.)\"</p><p><b>Boyd Magers</b>: \"Never one to overlook a secondary sale, Fox often repackaged four remaindered (unsold) comics into a 25\u00a2 Giant with a new cover, hence Hoot Gibson's Western Roundup, 132 pages dated 1950. However, since Fox always started their stories on the inside front cover (where other publishers ran an ad), these repackaged comics are always missing the first page of story content. Also, since Fox used remaindered issues, contents will vary from copy to copy of Hoot Gibson's Western Roundup.\"</p><p>Dynamite Entertainment has revived a few of the Fox Feature Syndicate characters in their Project Superpowers title</p><p>A portion of the Stable of characters that were originally published were:</p><p>Ace and Dart</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-banshee/29-73801/\">The Banshee</a></p><p>The Bat Boy</p><p>Beau Brummel</p><p>Birdman</p><p>Blackbird</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-fury/29-73806/\">Black Fury and Kid Fury</a></p><p>Black Lion</p><p>Blitz</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle-garret/29-18745/\">Blue Beetle</a> (Holyoke, Charlton and later DC)</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-bouncer/29-75003/\">The Bouncer</a> and Sparky</p><p>Bronze Man</p><p>Captain Kidd</p><p>Captain V</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagar-desert-hawk/29-34228/\">Dagar, the Desert Hawk</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dart-ace/65-57404/\">Dart and Ace</a></p><p>Doctor Death</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dynamite-thor/29-73824/\">Dynamite Thor</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-eagle/29-18752/\">The Eagle and Buddy</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dynamo/29-20352/\">Electro ( late Dynamo)</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-flame/29-24757/\">The Flame</a> and Flame Girl</p><p>Flip Falcon</p><p>Golden Knight</p><p>The Gorilla with the Human Brain</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-mask/29-51185/\">Green Mask</a> and Domino</p><p>The Hand</p><p>Illuso</p><p>Jaguar/Jaguar Man</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jo-jo-congo-king/49-19615/\">Jo Jo Congo King</a></p><p>Lunar the Moon Man</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-lynx/29-71660/\">The Lynx</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/panther-woman/29-69423/\">Marga the Panther Woman</a></p><p>The Mask</p><p>Miss X</p><p>Moth/Mothman</p><p>Nightbird</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-lady/49-26918/\">Phantom Lady</a> (obtained from Quality)</p><p>Professor Fiend</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purple-tigress/29-61284/\">Purple Tigress</a></p><p>Rani-Boy</p><p>The Rapier</p><p>The Raven</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rulah-jungle-goddess/49-21051/\">Rulah, Jungle Goddess</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/samson/29-52544/\">Samson</a></p><p>Sorceress of Zoom</p><p>Space Smith</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-queen/29-30223/\">Spider Queen</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stardust-the-super-wizard/29-27007/\">Stardust, the Super Wizard</a></p><p>Sub Saunders</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tangi/29-2377/\">Tangi</a></p><p>Tegra, the Jungle Princess</p><p>Thor</p><p>The Topper</p><p>Tumbler</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/us-jones/29-17039/\">U.S. Jones</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/v-man/29-8119/\">V-Man and the V-Boys</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-73295/\">Wonder Man</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-wraith/29-74160/\">The Wraith</a></p><p>Yank Wilson</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yarko-the-great/29-12801/\">Yarko, the Great</a></p><p>Zago, Jungle Prince</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rex-dexter/29-17833/\">Rex Dexter</a></p><p>Many of these characters have their separate page and others do not.

The Company was run by <a href=\"../../martin-goodman/26-43801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Martin Goodman</a>, established in 1939. Ironicly, the very first comic that Timely Comics published was named \"Marvel Comics\", the name that the company would later take on as their company-name.

The company published mostly super hero comics untill they no longer became profitabele in the late 1940's. In the 1950's the company changed it's name to <a href=\"../../atlas/57-75/\" rel=\"nofollow\">        Atlas</a>, publishing mostly Horror and Detective comics untill the early 1960's when the company again changed it's name. This time into <a href=\"../../marvel/57-31/\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Marvel</a> Comics, a name that would last and continues to build up on the foundations that where layed here by Timely Comics.",

        "description":"<br />The firm, first known as Educational Comics, was founded by <a href=\"/max-gaines/26-46137/\">                                                       Max Gaines</a>, former editor of the comic-book company All-American Publications. When that company merged with <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">                                                      DC Comics </a>in 1944, Gaines retained rights to the comic book, Picture Stories from the Bible, and began his new company with a dubious plan to market comics about science, history and the Bible to schools and churches. A decade earlier, Max Gaines had been one of the pioneers of the comic book form, with <a href=\"/eastern-color/57-22/\">                                                     Eastern Color Printing's</a> proto-comic book<a href=\"/funnies-on-parade/49-32056/\">                                                     Funnies on Parade</a>, and with<a href=\"/dell/57-4/\">                                                    Dell Publishing's</a> <a href=\"/famous-funnies/49-19491/\">                                                  Famous Funnies</a>: A Carnival of Comics considered by many historians to be the first true American comic book.<br /><br />When Max Gaines died in 1947 in a boating accident, his son William inherited the comics company. After four years (1942-46) in the Army Air Corps, Gaines had returned home to finish school at New York University, planning to work as a chemistry teacher. He never taught but instead took over the family business. In 1949 and 1950, <a href=\"/bill-gaines/26-42377/\">                                                 Will Gaines</a> began to introduce series focusing on horror, suspense, science fiction, military fiction and crime fiction. His editors, <a href=\"/al-feldstein/26-43465/\">                                                Al Feldstein</a> and <a href=\"/harvey-kurtzman/26-3909/\">                                               Harvey Kurtzman</a>, gave assignments to such prominent and highly accomplished freelance artists as <a href=\"/johnny-craig/26-3934/\">                                              Johnny Craig</a>, <a href=\"/reed-crandall/26-31165/\">                                             Reed Crandall</a>, <a href=\"/jack-davis/26-3914/\">                                            Jack Davis</a>, <a href=\"/william-elder/26-20234/\">                                           Will Elder,</a> <a href=\"/george-evans/26-26392/\">                                          George Evans</a>, <a href=\"/frank-frazetta/26-5649/\">                                         Frank Frazetta</a>, <a href=\"/graham-ingels/26-40150/\">                                        Graham Ingels</a>, <a href=\"/jack-kamen/26-40057/\">                                       Jack Kamen</a>, <a href=\"/bernie-krigstein/26-40074/\">                                      Bernard Kriegstein</a>, <a href=\"/joe-orlando/26-14643/\">                                     Joe Orlando</a>, <a href=\"/john-severin/26-5875/\">                                    John Severin</a>, <a href=\"/al-williamson/26-1531/\">                                   Al Williamson</a>, <a href=\"/basil-wolverton/26-9666/\">                                  Basil Wolverton</a>, and <a href=\"/wally-wood/26-6099/\">                                 Wally Wood</a>. Kurtzman and Feldstein themselves also drew stories, which generally were written by them and Craig, with assistance from Gaines. Other writers including <a href=\"/carl-wessler/26-44669/\">                                Carl Wessler</a>,<a href=\"/jack-oleck/26-44730/\">                                Jack Oleck</a> and<a href=\"/otto-binder/26-42374/\">                               Otto Binder </a>were later brought on board.<br /><br />EC had success with its fresh approach and pioneered in forming relationships with its readers through its letters to the editor and its fan organization, the National EC Fan-Addict Club. While the stories were sensational, the art was highly regarded.<br /><br />EC Comics promoted its stable of illustrators, allowing each to sign his art and encouraging them to develop idiosyncratic styles; the company additionally published one-page biographies of them in the comic books. This was in contrast to the industry's common practice, in which credits were often missing, although some artists at other companies, such as the <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">                            Jack Kirby</a>-<a href=\"/joe-simon/26-9443/\">                           Joe Simon</a> team, <a href=\"/jack-cole/26-42220/\">                          Jack Cole</a> and<a href=\"/bob-kane/26-19137/\">                          Bob Kane </a>had been prominently promoted elsewhere at the time.<br /><br />EC published distinct lines of titles under its Entertaining Comics umbrella. Most notorious were its horror books, <a href=\"/tales-from-the-crypt-1950/49-18612/\">                        Tales from the Crypt</a>, <a href=\"/vault-of-horror/49-11447/\">                       The Vault of Horror</a> and <a href=\"/haunt-of-fear/49-1398/\">                      The Haunt of Fear</a>.<br /> &nbsp; These titles reveled in a gruesome joie de vivre, with grimly ironic fates meted out to many of the stories' protagonists. The company's war comics <a href=\"/frontline-combat/49-1443/\">                     Frontline Combat</a> and <a href=\"/two-fisted-tales/49-1376/\">                    Two-Fisted Tales</a> often featured weary-eyed, unheroic stories out of step with the jingoistic times. <a href=\"/shock-suspenstories/49-1511/\">                   Shock SuspenStories </a>tackled weighty issues such as racism, sex, drug use and the American way of life. EC always claimed to be \"proudest of our science fiction titles\", with <a href=\"/weird-science/49-18944/\">                  Weird Science</a> and <a href=\"/weird-fantasy/49-1444/\">                 Weird Fantasy</a> publishing stories unlike the space opera found in such titles as <a href=\"/fiction-house/57-8/\">                Fiction House's</a> <a href=\"/planet-comics/49-816/\">               Planet Comics</a>. <a href=\"/crime-suspenstories/49-1373/\">              Crime SuspenStories</a> had many parallels with film noir. As noted by<a href=\"/max-allan-collins/26-56814/\">              Max Allan Collins</a> in his story annotations for <a href=\"/russ-cochran/57-2517/\">            Russ Cochran's</a> 1983 hardcover reprint of Crime SuspenStories, Johnny Craig had developed a \"film noir-ish bag of effects\" in his visuals, while characters and themes found in the crime stories often showed the strong influence of writers associated with film noir, notably James M. Cain.<br /><br />Superior illustrations of stories with surprise endings became EC's trademark. Gaines would generally stay up late and read large amounts of material while seeking \"springboards\" for story concepts. The next day he would present each premise until Feldstein found one that he thought he could develop into a story.&nbsp; At EC's peak, Feldstein edited seven titles while Kurtzman handled three. Artists were assigned stories specific to their styles. Davis and Ingels often drew gruesome, supernatural-themed stories, while Kamen and Evans did tamer material.<br /><br />With hundreds of stories written, common themes became apparent. Some of EC's more well-known themes include:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * An ordinary situation given an ironic and gruesome twist, often as poetic justice for a character's crimes. In \"Collection Completed\" a man takes up taxidermy in order to annoy his wife. When he kills and stuffs her beloved cat, the wife snaps and kills him, stuffing and mounting his body. In \"Revulsion\", a spaceship pilot is bothered by insects due to a past experience when he found one in his food. At the conclusion of the story, a giant alien insect screams in horror at finding the dead pilot in his salad. Dissection, the broiling of lobsters, Mexican jumping beans, fur coats and fishing are just a small sample of the kind of situations and objects used in this fashion.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The \"Grim Fairy Tale\", featuring gruesome interpretations of such fairy tales as \"Hansel and Gretel\", \"Sleeping Beauty\" and \"Little Red Riding Hood\".<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Siamese twins were a popular theme, primarily in EC's three horror comics. No less than nine siamese twin stories appeared in EC's horror and crime comics from 1950-1954. In an interview Feldstein speculated that he and Gaines wrote so many siamese twin stories because of the interdependence they had on each other, as if they were siamese twins themselves. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Adaptations of Ray Bradbury science-fiction stories, which appeared in two dozen EC comics starting in 1952. It began inauspiciously, with an incident in which Feldstein and Gaines plagiarized two of Bradbury's stories and combined them into a single tale. Learning of the story, Bradbury sent a note praising them, while remarking that he had \"inadvertently\" not yet received his payment for their use. EC sent a check and negotiated a productive series of Bradbury adaptations.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Stories with a political message, which became common in EC's science fiction and suspense comics. Among the many topics were lynching, anti-Semitism and police corruption.<br /><br />The three horror titles featured stories introduced by a trio of horror hosts. <a href=\"/the-crypt-keeper/29-3920/\">           The Crypt Keeper</a> introduced Tales from the Crypt, the <a href=\"/the-vault-keeper/29-3807/\">          Vault Keeper </a>welcomed readers to The Vault of Horror and the <a href=\"/the-old-witch/29-48147/\">         Old Witch</a> cackled over The Haunt of Fear. Besides gleefully recounting the unpleasant details of the stories, the characters squabbled with one another, unleashed an arsenal of puns and even insulted and taunted the readers: \"Greetings, boils and ghouls...\" This irreverent mockery of the audience also became the trademark attitude of <a href=\"/mad/49-9318/\">      Mad</a>, and such glib give-and-take was later mimicked by many, including<a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">         Stan Lee </a>at <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">       Marvel Comics</a>.<br /><br />EC's most lasting legacy came with Mad, which started as a side project for Kurtzman before buoying the company's fortunes and becoming one of the country's most notable and enduring humor publications. When satire became an industry rage in 1954 and other publishers created imitations of Mad, EC introduced a sister title, <a href=\"/panic/49-19325/\">     Panic,</a> edited by Al Feldstein and using the regular Mad artists, plus Joe Orlando.<br /><br /><br /><br />Beginning in the late 1940s, the comic book industry became the target of mounting public criticism for the content of comic books and their potentially harmful effects on children. The problem came to a head in 1948 with the publication by <a href=\"/fredric-wertham/29-6619/\">    Dr. Fredric Wertham</a> of two articles: \"Horror in the Nursery\" (in Collier's) and \"The Psychopathology of Comic Books\" (in the American Journal of Psychotherapy). As a result, an industry trade group, the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers, was formed in 1948, but proved ineffective. EC left the association in 1950 after Gaines had an argument with its executive director, Henry Schultz. By 1954 only three comic publishers were still members, and Schultz admitted that the ACMP seals placed on comics were meaningless. <br /><br />In 1954, the publication of Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent and a highly publicized Congressional hearing on juvenile delinquency cast comic books in an especially poor light. At the same time, a federal investigation led to a shakeup in the distribution companies that delivered comic books and pulp magazines across America. Sales plummeted, and several companies went out of business.<br /><br />Gaines called a meeting of his fellow publishers and suggested that the comic book industry gather to fight outside censorship and help repair the industry's damaged reputation. They formed the Comics Magazine Association of America and its <a href=\"/comics-code-authority/12-42382/\">   Comics Code Authority</a>. The CCA code expanded on the ACMP's restrictions. Unlike its predecessor, the CCA code was rigorously enforced, with all comics requiring code approval prior to their publication. This not being what Gaines intended, he refused to join the association.&nbsp; Among the Code's new rules were that no comic book title could use the words \"horror\" or \"terror\" or \"weird\" on its cover. When distributors refused to handle many of his comics, Gaines ended publication of his three horror and the two SuspenStory titles on September 14, 1954. EC shifted its focus to a line of more realistic comic book titles, including <a href=\"/md/49-1733/\">  M.D.</a> and <a href=\"/psychoanalysis/49-1734/\"> Psychoanalysis</a> (known as the New Direction line). It also renamed its remaining science-fiction comic. Since the initial issues did not carry the Comics Code seal, the wholesalers refused to carry them. After consulting with his staff, Gaines reluctantly started submitting his comics to the Comics Code; all the New Direction titles carried the seal starting with the second issue. This attempted revamp failed commercially and after the fifth issues, all the New Direction titles were canceled.<br /><br />Gaines waged a number of battles with the Comics Code Authority in an attempt to keep his magazines free from censorship. In one particular example noted by comics historian Digby Diehl, Gaines threatened Judge Charles Murphy, the Comics Code Administrator, with a lawsuit when Murphy ordered EC to alter the science-fiction story \"Judgment Day.\" The story depicted a human astronaut visiting a planet inhabited by robots as a representative of the Galactic Republic. He finds the robots divided into functionally identical orange and blue races, one of which has fewer rights and privileges than the other. The astronaut decides that due to the robots' bigotry, the Galactic Republic should not admit the planet. In the final panel, he removes his helmet, revealing himself to be a black man. Murphy demanded, without any authority in the Code, that the black astronaut had to be removed. As Diehl recounted in Tales from the Crypt: The Official Archives:<br /><br />\"This really made 'em go bananas in the Code czar's office. 'Judge Murphy was off his nut. He was really out to get us', recalls [EC editor] Feldstein. 'I went in there with this story and Murphy says, \"It can't be a Black man\". But ... but that's the whole point of the story!' Feldstein sputtered. When Murphy continued to insist that the Black man had to go, Feldstein put it on the line. 'Listen', he told Murphy, 'you've been riding us and making it impossible to put out anything at all because you guys just want us out of business'. [Feldstein] reported the results of his audience with the czar to Gaines, who was furious [and] immediately picked up the phone and called Murphy. 'This is ridiculous!' he bellowed. 'I'm going to call a press conference on this. You have no grounds, no basis, to do this. I'll sue you'. Murphy made what he surely thought was a gracious concession. 'All right. Just take off the beads of sweat'. At that, Gaines and Feldstein both went ballistic. 'Fuck you!' they shouted into the telephone in unison. Murphy hung up on them, but the story ran in its original form. \"<br /><br />Feldstein, interviewed for the book Tales of Terror: The EC Companion, reiterated his recollection of Murphy making the racist request:<br /><br />\"So he said it can't be a Black [person]. So I said, 'For God's sakes, Judge Murphy, that's the whole point of the Goddamn story!' So he said, 'No, it can't be a Black'. Bill [Gaines] just called him up [later] and raised the roof, and finally they said, 'Well, you gotta take the perspiration off'. I had the stars glistening in the perspiration on his Black skin. Bill said, 'Fuck you', and he hung up.\"<br /><br /><br />Although the story would eventually be printed uncensored in Incredible Science Fiction #33, it was the last comic book ever published by EC.&nbsp; Gaines switched his focus to EC's Picto-Fiction titles, a line of typeset black-and-white magazines with heavily illustrated stories. Fiction was formatted to alternate illustrations with blocks of typeset text, and some of the contents were rewrites of stories previously published in EC's comic books. This experimental line lost money from the start and only lasted two issues per title. When EC's national distributor went bankrupt, Gaines dropped all of his titles except Mad. <br />&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; <br /> <h3>The Vault of Horror, Tales from the Crypt, and The Haunt of Fear </h3><br />&nbsp; The Vault of Horror, Tales from the Crypt, and The Haunt of Fear are three bi-monthly horror comic anthology series published by EC Comics in the early 1950s. The Vault of Horror hit newsstands with its April/May 1950 issue and ceased publication with its December/January 1955 issue, producing a total of twenty-nine issues. The title was popular, but, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, comic books came under attack from moralizing parents, clergymen, schoolteachers, and others who believed the books contributed to illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In April and June 1954, highly publicized Congressional subcommittee hearings on the effects of comic books upon children left the comics industry shaken. With the imposition of the highly restrictive Comics Code Authority, EC Comics publisher William Maxwell Gaines canceled The Vault of Horror and its two companion titles in September 1954. All three titles have been reprinted at various times since their demise and have been adapted for television and film.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;Horror comics emerged as a distinct comic book genre after World War II when young adult males lost interest in caped crimebusters, and returning GIs wanted titillating sex and violence in their reading. One-shot Eerie Comics (1947) is generally considered the first true horror comic with its cover depicting a dagger-wielding, red eyed ghoul threatening a rope-bound, scantily clad, voluptuous young woman beneath a full moon. In 1948, Adventures Into the Unknown became the first regularly published horror title, enjoying a nearly two decade life-span.<br /><br />In 1950, publisher William Gaines and his editor Al Feldstein discovered they shared similar tastes in horror and began experimenting with such stories in EC's crime comic War Against Crime and its companion title, Crime Patrol. With issue #12 of War Against Crime, the title was changed permanently to The Vault of Horror. The Vault Keeper became the title's sardonic host and commentator, occasionally sharing duties with The Old Witch and The Crypt Keeper. Due to an attempt to save money on second-class postage permits, the numbering, however, did not change with the title \u2014 the first issue of The Vault of Horror was #12.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Like its horror companion titles, Tales From the Crypt and The Haunt of Fear, The Vault of Horror had its own distinctive qualities and atmosphere \u2014 in this case, created by its main artist, Johnny Craig. Craig illustrated all the covers for the entire run and was responsible for the lead story of all but issues #13 and #33. He also wrote all his own stories (save two) in Vault, something rarely done at EC, and became editor with issue #35 (February, 1954). Gaines and Feldstein wrote almost every other story until late 1953/early 1954 when outside writers Carl Wessler and Jack Oleck were brought in. Other contributing artists to The Vault of Horror were Feldstein, George Evans, Jack Kamen, Wally Wood, Graham Ingels, Harvey Kurtzman, Jack Davis, Sid Check, Al Williamson, Joe Orlando, Reed Crandall, Bernard Krigstein, Harry Harrison and Howard Larsen.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />With The Crypt Keeper and The Old Witch, The Vault-Keeper was one of the hosts for EC's horror comics (known as the GhouLunatics), He served as narrator, and added a lighter touch to the often gruesome stories by using a number of puns. In addition to appearances in his own book, he also had a guest story in each issue of Tales From the Crypt and The Haunt of Fear. Although The Vault-Keeper was originally designed by Al Feldstein, Johnny Craig is the artist most associated with the character, having drawn all his lead stories in the Vault of Horror with the exception of two. Craig would also draw The Vault-Keeper in his guest appearances in the other comics, although another artist frequently drew the rest of the story. For the final four issues of The Vault of Horror, The Vault-Keeper was joined by Drusilla, hostess of the book. The Vault-Keeper appeared in animated form on Tales from the Cryptkeeper and was voiced by Dan Hennessey.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In 1954, Gaines and Feldstein intended to add a fourth book to their horror publications by reactivating an earlier title, The Crypt of Terror. They were stopped dead in their tracks, however. Horror and other violent comics had come under scrutiny by moralizing parents, schoolteachers, clergymen, psychologists, and others who viewed the material as dangerous to the well-being of children and a significant contributor to the juvenile delinquency crisis in America (although the formulaic nature of the books usually resulted in truly immoral characters receiving a well-deserved, if gruesome, comeupance.) Matters came to a head in April and June 1954 with a highly publicized Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. Hearings targeted violent comic books \u2014 which fared poorly in the proceedings. While the committee stopped short of blaming the comics industry for juvenile deliquency, they did suggest it tone down the product. Publishers were left reeling.<br /><br />The industry deftly avoided outside censorship by creating the self-regulatory Comics Magazine Association of America (CMAA) and a Comics Code Authority (CCA) that placed severe restrictions on violent comic book genres. Publishers were forbidden from using the words \"terror\" and \"horror\" in titles, for example, and forbidden from depicting zombies, werewolves, and other gruesome characters and outr\u00e8 horror fiction trappings. Gaines was fed up; he believed his titles were being specifically targeted and realized they were doomed to future failure. He threw in the towel, canceling The Vault of Horror and its companion titles in September 1954. The last issue of Vault was its twenty-ninth, (#40, December/January 1955). Since an issue of The Crypt of Terror had already been produced, it was published as the final issue of Tales from the Crypt, February/March, 1955.",
        "deck":"Entertaining Comics, more commonly known as EC Comics, was an American publisher of comic books specializing in horror fiction, crime fiction, satire, military fiction and science fiction from the 1940s through the mid-1950s, most notably the Tales from the Crypt series, until censorship pressures prompted it to concentrate on the seminal humor magazine Mad, which became a major popular culture institution. The publishing company was privately owned by Maxwell Gaines and later, during its period of notoriety in the early-mid 1950s, by his son, William Gaines.",

        "description":"<b>Avon</b> Books was founded in 1941 by the American News Corporation (ANC) to create a rival to Pocket Books. They hired brother and sister Joseph Myers and Edna Myers Williams to establish the company. ANC bought out J.S. Ogilvie Publications, a pulp magazine publisher partly owned by both the Myers, and renamed it \"Avon Publications\". They also got into comic books. \"The early Avons were somewhat similar in appearance to the existing paperbacks of Pocket Books, resulting in an immediate and largely ineffective lawsuit by that company. Despite this superficial similarity, though, from early on Myers differentiated Avon by placing an emphasis on popular appeal rather than loftier concepts of literary merit.\"] The first 40 titles were not numbered. First editions of the first dozen or so have front and rear endpapers with an illustration of a globe. The emphasis on \"popular appeal\" led Avon to publish ghost stories, sexually-suggestive love stories, fantasy novels and science fiction in its early years, which were far removed in audience appeal from the somewhat more literary Pocket competition.<br /><br />As well as normal-sized paperbacks, Avon published digest-format paperbacks (the size and shape of the present-day Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine) in series. These included Murder Mystery Monthly, Modern Short Story Monthly and Avon Fantasy Readers. Many authors highly prized by present-day collectors were published in these editions, including A. Merritt, James M. Cain, H. P. Lovecraft, Raymond Chandler and Robert E. Howard.<br /><br />In 1953, Avon Books sold books in the price range of 25\u00a2 to 50\u00a2 (for the Avon \"G\" series, the \"G\" standing for \"Giant\") and were selling more than 20 million copies a year. Their books were characterized by Time Magazine as \"westerns, whodunits and the kind of boy-meets-girl story that can be illustrated by a ripe cheesecake jacket.\" At around this time, Avon also began to publish under other imprints, including Eton (1951-1953), Novel Library, Broadway and Diversey. Avon's 35-cent \"T\" series, introduced in 1953, also had strong mass-market appeal and contains many outstanding examples of the then-popular juvenile delinquent story. The T series also contained many movie tie-in editions and the stand-bys of mysteries and science fiction.<br /><br />Avon was bought by the Hearst Corporation in 1959. In 1999, the News Corporation bought out Hearst's book division, and merged Avon with HarperCollins.",

        "description":"<h2>Publishing History</h2><p>Charlton Comics started in 1946 and went on until 1985. The company covered a broad range of comic style and did not seem to stick with a main style. For example the printed War Comics, Horror Comics, Cartoon Comics, Comedy Comics, Superhero Comics, Kung Fu Comics, Action Adventure Comics, Romantic Comics and Science Fiction Comics.</p><p>Charlton and DC both produced some excellent romance titles for a while in the 1950's, 60's and 70's. However, for whatever reason, it seemed like the romance artwork was at it's peak with both companies from about 1958/1959 to 1965/1966. Charlton's romance titles during this period were: Brides in Love, I Love You, Just Married, My Secret Life, Romantic Secrets, Romantic Story, Sweetheart Diary, Sweethearts, Teen-Age Confidential Confessions, Teen-Age Love and Teen Confessions. While it is true that most readers of romance comics claim that DC's art was superior to that of Charlton, such is a matter of personal opinoin. The author of this paragraph and fan of romance comic art is of the view that from the late 1950's to the mid 1960's, Charlton's romance titles were just as good as those from DC and probably a shade better.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1257131\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1257131-007_super.jpg\" title=\"Top Charlton Heroes\"><img id=\"1257131\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1257131-007_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Top Charlton Heroes\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Top Charlton Heroes</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> acquired the rights to several characters from Charlton Comics who made significant appearances in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a> story arc. During the Crisis, these heroes came from a reality known as Earth-4 and became merged with the New Earth after the Crisis and part of the eventual retcon of the DC Universe. The Charlton heroes from Earth-4 that appeared in the Crisis included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-atom/29-2050/\">Captain Atom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ted-kord/29-2054/\">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightshade/29-4881/\">Nightshade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peacemaker/29-14371/\">Peacemaker</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/judomaster/29-18995/\">JudoMaster</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolt/29-4894/\">Thunderbolt</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/question/29-3211/\">Question</a>. Not every hero was bought by DC Comics. One such hero was <a href=\"/mercury-man/29-71497/\">Mercury Man</a>. He was a hero from a post apocalyptic planet <a href=\"/mercury/34-56298/\">Mercury</a>.</p><p>Then In 1996 Roger Broughton, owner of Sword In Stone Productions, purchased the rights to the remaining Charlton Comics and characters (the <a href=\"/the-fightin-5/49-34594/\">Fightin\u2019 5</a>, <a>Gunmaster</a> &amp; Bullet Boy, and <a href=\"/atomic-rabbit/49-36552/\">Atomic Rabbit</a>, and after being bought from Fawcett, Don Winslow) that had not been bought by DC comics, who now own the rights to most of Charlton\u2019s superheroes. Later he also bought the rights to the titles and characters of the old ACG comics group ( <a href=\"/magicman/29-38564/\">Magicman</a>, <a href=\"/john-force/29-38482/\">John Force: Magic Agent</a>, <a href=\"/nemesis/29-38695/\">Nemesis</a>, Herbie \u201cthe <a href=\"/herbert-popnecker/29-38595/\">Fat Fury</a>\u201d <a href=\"/herbert-popnecker/29-38595/\">Popnecker</a>, the <a href=\"/hooded-horseman/29-74394/\">Hooded Horseman</a>, <a href=\"/cowboy-sahib/29-61473/\">Cowboy Sahib</a>, and Commander Battle and his Atomic Sub.)</p><p>In 2002 he changed the name of his company to the \"Charlton Media Group\". Since then he has announced attempts to revive the various titles and characters that he owns, but so far nothing new has come of it other than a number of reprints of Charlton and ACG material in Europe, and the licensing of the rights to produce new Nemesis, Magicman and Herbie stories to Dark Horse as yet the other characters remain untouched.</p><h2>Charlton's Greatest Heroes</h2><p>So, many of Charlton's characters were bought by DC Comics that the Top Charlton Characters list to the left of the page is very inaccurate. Many of Charlton's more famous heroes are not attributed to Charlton and are instead attributed to DC. This leaves Charlton's greatest characters in the dark.</p><p>It should also be noted that because of Charlton's Large and diverse variety that they did not have a large pantheon of heroes. Now that is compared to companies like DC Comics and <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel Comics</a>. They did have several heroes however that made up a cool list. Many of these heroes went on to have a big legacy in the DC Universe. Below is a list of Charlton's more famous Characters in alphabetical order.</p><p><b>Blue Beetles</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1309954\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex_super.jpg\" title=\"Ted Kord - Blue Beetle\"><img id=\"1309954\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1309954-00_vortex_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ted Kord - Blue Beetle\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ted Kord - Blue Beetle</div></div></div></div><p>There is probably no hero more loved in all of Charlton Comics than the Blue Beetle. Charlton bought the rights to the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle/29-4438/\">Blue Beetle</a> Dan Garret from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fox/57-18/\">Fox Comics</a>. This eventually (in a way) kept him out of the Public Domain unlike his counterparts <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/samson/29-52544/\">Samson</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-flame/29-24757/\">Flame</a> from the same publisher.</p><p>Despite the popularity of the original Blue Beetle, Charlton completely rebooted the character. He had different powers, origin, occupation, secondary characters and even his last name had a different spelling with an extra t. Unfortunately for the character he was not as popular after the reboot as he was before so to solve the problem they decided to reboot the character again. This time Dan was killed off and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ted-kord/29-2054/\">Ted Kord</a> became the next Blue Beetle. Ted Kord was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joe-gill/26-51233/\">Joe Gill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steve-ditko/26-4026/\">Steve Ditko</a>.</p><p>When DC bought the rights to the characters they bought both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dan-garret/29-18745/\">Dan Garrett</a> (with two t's) and Ted Kord and continued on this the story instead of starting over with the original Dan Garret (with one t). This technically means that the Dan Garret (with one t) is suppose to be in public domain but it is difficult to clarify with name similarities and so not much has been done with it. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dynamite-entertainment/57-1859/\">Dynamite Entertainment</a> revamp the character and called him <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarab/29-6238/\">Scarab</a>. They also used his sidekick <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sparky/29-51134/\">Sparky</a> who is in Public Domain.</p><p><b>Captain Atom</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1310392\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1310392-00_vortex_super.jpg\" title=\"Captain Atom - Costumes\"><img id=\"1310392\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1310392-00_vortex_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Atom - Costumes\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Captain Atom - Costumes</div></div></div></div><p>Captain Atom was created for Charlton Comics also by Joe Gill and Steve Ditko in Charlton Comics his name was Allen Adam when he was bought out by DC comics his name was changed to Nathaniel Christopher Adam. His costume was also changed several times. There were two three main costumes however and one of them may have been a printing mistake.</p><p>In the first issue Captain Atom has a blue costume on the inside of the book but a gold one on the cover. He did then wear the gold costumes for quite a while with small variations until he went to the blue and red costume with the silver arms. It wasn't until he went to DC that his costume changed to the mostly silver costume he wears today</p><p><b>E-Man and Nova Cane</b></p><p>E-Man and Nova Cane are two heroes that were not purchased by DC but have been written about in comic companies like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/first/57-324/\">First Comics</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/comico/57-336/\">Comico</a>. The characters were created by Nikola Cuti and Joe Stanton. E-Man was a hero along the lines of Plastic Man. He was suppose to be more comical than a traditional hero. His girlfriend eventually became a hero as well with the same powers as E-Man. In many ways Nova overshadowed the main hero of the books even when she wasn't a superhero.</p><p><b>Judo Master and Tiger</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1310475\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1310475-19_super.jpg\" title=\"Tiger and Judo Master\"><img id=\"1310475\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1310475-19_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Tiger and Judo Master\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tiger and Judo Master</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/judomaster/29-18995/\">Judo Master</a> was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joe-gill/26-51233/\">Joe Gill</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frank-mclaughlin/26-27780/\">Frank McLaughlin</a>. Judo master was a World War II vet that save a man's daughter while at was in the specific and is taught judo by the grateful father. Judo Master eventually gets a sidekick named Tiger. Judo Master was another of the characters bought by DC Comics and has subsequently gone through many changes. Lately the new Judo Master is a woman named Sonia Sato.</p><p><b>Mr. Muscles</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-muscles/29-72341/\">Mr. Muscles</a> was created by Jerry Siegel and was the star of a two issue self titles series. He may not have been one of the greatest Charlton characters but he did have a fortunate chance to have his own book even if it only lasted two issues. He only appeared in one issue after that.</p><p><b>Nature Boy</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nature-boy/29-50996/\">Nature Boy</a> like Mr. Muscles was also created by Jerry Siegel. Actually Nature Boy shares a lot with Mr. Muscles. Not only do they share the same creator, they were both fortunate enough to have a very small run in their own self titled comic.</p><p><b>Nightshade</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1311262\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1311262-v_harvjartiruuman_super.jpg\" title=\"Charlton's Nightshade\"><img id=\"1311262\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1311262-v_harvjartiruuman_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Charlton's Nightshade\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Charlton's Nightshade</div></div></div></div><p>Nightshade was only in a handful of Charlton Comics but she did have a powerful legacy in DC Comics. She was created by Joe Gill and Steve Ditko. In DC Comics Nightshade appeared in many issues of the Suicide Squad and Shadowpack. She has also gone through many evolutions that has made her a very popular hero.</p><p><b>Peacemaker</b></p><p>Peacemaker first appeared in Charlton Comics as part of a team known as the Fighting 5. He then had his own series that lasted five issues. Peacemaker was created by Joe Gill and Pat Boyette and was completely rebooted in the DC Universe.</p><p><b>Phantom</b></p><p>The Phantom is one of the oldest superheros ever and is considered to be the first by some. The Phantom first appeared two years before <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> and the Blue Beetle. Charlton picked up the hero and he was their longest running superhero series. He was created by Lee Falk.</p><p><b>Question</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1311356\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1311356-00_arcadia_super.jpg\" title=\"Question, Phantom, Steel\"><img id=\"1311356\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1311356-00_arcadia_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Question, Phantom, Steel\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Question, Phantom, Steel</div></div></div></div><p>The Question first appeared in Blue Beetle and was created by Steve Ditko. The Question was considered one of Charlton's bigger heroes even though he never had his own series. In DC Comics the Question became quite popular in his own title self titled comic and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-question-quarterly/49-4374/\">Question Quarterly</a>. The Question became popular again in the Justice League Unlimited cartoons and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/52/49-18053/\">52</a> series where he died of cancer and passed the torch on to Renee Montoya.</p><p><b>Sarge Steel</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sarge-steel/29-9931/\">Sarge Steel</a> was created by Pat Musulli and made his first appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sarge-steel/49-2271/\">Sarge Steel</a> #1. Sarge Steel was not an a typical hero and was private eye and Viet Nam veteran. His name and power came from his hand that was formed in a fist.</p><p>When Sarge Steel came to DC Comics his character became more entrenched as a government agent. He did a lot of work with Project X and the suicide squad. This has put him in a situation of being pitted against and worked for the more costumed superheroes.</p><p><b>Son of Vulcan</b></p><p><a href=\"/son-of-vulcan/29-30891/\">Son of Vulcan</a> was also created by Pat Musulli with the help of penciler Bill Fraccio. Son of Vulcan was really Johnny Mann who was several injured in war and cursed the gods who allowed him to end up this way. His prayer/plea does not go unanswered as Vulcan himself arrives and tells him his troubles or not of the gods by the failures of man. Not only that but Vulcan gives him the power to fight for justice.</p><p><b>Thunderbolt</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1313491\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia_super.jpg\" title=\"Thunderbolt &amp; Yang\"><img id=\"1313491\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1313491-00_arcadia_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Thunderbolt &amp; Yang\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Thunderbolt & Yang</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolt/29-4894/\">Peter Cannon, Thunderbolt</a> was created by Pete Morisi. Peter Cannon was an orphaned child who was raised by Tibetan monks. The monks were very grateful to Peter's parents</p><p><b>Yang</b></p><p><a href=\"/yang/29-36520/\">Yang</a> was created by Joe Gill and Warren Sattler. Yang was more of a Kung Fu fighter and sometimes didn't fit the superhero mold to some. The truth is he wore a costume and set out to fight crime. He even wore a costume that was the same issue to issue.</p>",

        "description":"<span>\n<p>Ziff-Davis is a publishing firm that has been around since the 1920\u2019s and is in fact still around to day publishing mainly computer and technology magazines and which is one of the biggest producers of on-line magazines.</p>\n<p>They have had a diverse range of publications over the years, from Popular Electronics, to for a while, Amazing Stories the first science fiction pulp.</p>\n<p>They however came late into publishing comic books, and did not stay long when they did. Starting in 1950 they produced dozens of titles, almost none of which lasted longer than half a dozen issues, they ended their&nbsp;try at comic books&nbsp;late in 1953.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Their two most successful comics were G. I. Joe, which lasted 46 issues, and Kid Cowboy which lasted 10 issues.</p>\n<p>The things that most distinguish a Z-D comic are their striking painted covers that more resemble the pulp magazines of an earlier era, the extensive use of violent and sexually suggestive covers on many of their comics, and the odd fact that they almost always start their books with issue # 10, but if it is able to last more than a half dozen issues switching to the number that it would have been at if they had started it at # 1, so that several of their comics have two # 10\u2019s - 14 and no # 1 - 5.</p>\n<p>This to say the least caused some consternation to collectors when the hobby became popular after Z-D left the comics business, which they did with the coming of the Comics Code Authority, which would never have approved of some of their covers. </p></span>",

Years before today's trend in glossy reprints of public-domain comics, Waldman grabbed work from several defunct publishers (among them the renowned <a href=\"/quality-comics/57-15/\">QUALITY</a> Comics, <a href=\"/avon/57-121/\">Avon</a>, <a href=\"/fox/57-18/\">Fox</a>, <a href=\"/toby/57-123/\">Toby</a>, <a href=\"/magazine-enterprises/57-84/\">Magazine Enterprises</a>, Harry A. <a href=\"/harry-a-cheslerdynamic/57-1884/\">Chesler</a>, and others) and re-issued them with new covers -- and sometimes new titles: <a href=\"/dan-garret/29-18745/\">The Blue Beetle</a> appeared in a comic book titled \"<a href=\"/human-fly/49-1920/\">The Human Fly</a>\" for just one example-- and at times, without even bothering to receive legal authorization to actually <i>produce</i> those reprints. It seemed a sure-fire way to easy money-- low production costs, low overhead, and, if the covers were appealing enough, an unsuspecting audience eager for new titles. It jjust wasn't always legal, or ethical for that matter.</p><p>I.W. and its quickly-created partner company Super Comics, released Westerns, Humor, Funny Animals, Superheroes, Horror, Science Fiction, Romance, War, seemingly anything they could get their hands on. Regardless of the contents of the books, it is often amusing to see what sort of misleading cover has been put on these reprints. It may be rewarding to inspect the publisher's output at The <a href=\"http://www.digitalcomicmuseum.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Digital Comics Museum,</a> and a very interesting article on I.W. by T. Casey Brennan appeared in the 57th issue of <a href=\"/comics-journal/49-35609/\">The Comics Journal</a> from June 1980.</p><p>Nevertheless, sometimes a product is seen as what it actually <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shit\" rel=\"nofollow\">is</a>, and I.W./Super was out of business by 1964. Waldman went on to found the <a href=\"/warren/57-173/\">Warren</a>-inspired <a href=\"/skywald/57-214/\">SKYWALD</a> line of B&amp;W Horror Magazines with Marvel production chief <a href=\"/sol-brodsky/26-6100/\">Sol Brodsky</a>.</p>",

        "description":"James Warren founded the Warren Publishing in Philadelphia in 1957. Warren Publishing\u00b4s first magazines were FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND an MONSTER WORLD. The editor in chief for both titels was the legendary science fiction/horror grandmaster Forrest J. Ackerman.<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"7020\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/7020-1992-7675-1-famous-monsters-of-f_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"7020\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/7020-1992-7675-1-famous-monsters-of-f_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div>\n<br /> FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND was orginally supposed to be a one shot published in 1958, but when it went to it\u00b4s second printing Warren and Ackerman decided to continue it. Magazine started when Warren noticed that baby boomer children wathcing old horror movies in television shows that each had a monster host, were actually rooting for the monsters. He wanted to create similar thing in magazine format. The first number sold out in days and later on the magazine had a print run of 200 000 copies.<br /><br /> In 1960 Warren started to publish Help! magazine. It employed many former MAD artists and was edited by Harvey Kurtzman. During it\u00b4s five year run, Help! had many collaborators who later on became famous, Terry Gilliam, Gloria Steinem, John Cleese and Woody Allen. It also featured underground comics by Robert Crumb and Gilberts Shelton.<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"6263\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/6263-2194-6839-1-creepy_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"6263\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/6263-2194-6839-1-creepy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div>\n<br /> The monster comics Warren published in MONSTER WORLD expanded to two legendary horror comics, CREEPY and EERIE. Warren was able to avert the Comics Code cencorship by claiming that his publication was not in fact a comic, but due to pricing and format a magazine. This was also to protect James Warren from the fate that EC publisher BILL GAINES suffered in front of a Congressional committee.<br /><br /> Warren also published openly anti-war war comic, BLAZING COMBAT in 1965-66. He later said that from everything he published, he was most proud from these four issues. Because of the content of BLAZING COMBAT, the U.S. Army PXs refused to sell it, and when other wholesalers were threatening to drop every WARREN publications from their shelves because of BC, it was ended.<br /><br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"7374\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"7374\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/7374-2242-8110-1-blazing-combat_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div>\n<br /> In 1969 Warren launched it\u00b4s third classic horror comic, VAMPIRELLA. It was a hit and ment end to a dry season that had followed company\u00b4s move to New York and a cash flow problem. During this period Warren also started to use more and more Spanish artists mainly in production of VAMPIRELLA.<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"9445\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/9445-2449-10419-1-vampirella_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"9445\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/9445-2449-10419-1-vampirella_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div>\n<br /> In 1971 the company changed it\u00b4s name to WARREN COMMUNICATIONS and the orginal company was dissolved. In 1974 Warren started to publish Will Eisner\u00b4s legendary THE SPIRIT in magazine format.<br /><br /> In 1983 James Warren declared banckruptcy and the HARRIS PUBLICATIONS bought the companys assets same year. This was followed by a lawsuit that eventually gave back the rights of EERIE and CREEPY to James Warren in 1998.",

        "description":"<p>Gold Key Comics was created in 1962, when Western switched to in-house publishing rather than packaging content for branding and distribution by its business partner, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dell/57-4/\">Dell Comics</a>. Hoping to make their comics more like traditional children's books they initially eliminated panel borders (using strips of color instead) and had word and thought balloons that were rectangular rather than oval. Within a year they had reverted to using inked panel borders and oval balloons. They also experimented with new formats, including black and white 136 page hardcovers containing reprints (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whitman/57-68/\">Whitman Comic Books</a>) and tabloid sized 52 page hardcovers containing new material (Golden Picture Story Book). These evidently were aimed at the book trade and department stores, in the manner of their popular Little Golden Books. In 1967 they reprinted a number of selected issues of their comics under the title Top Comics which were sold in plastic bags of 5 at gas stations and various eateries; some locations removed them from the bags and sold them individually with price stickers attached to the covers.</p><p>A striking difference between Gold Key and other publishers (which had been done by Dell as well) was to publish most of their mystery, jungle, science-fiction, adventure and similar series with full color painted covers rather than the standard line-artwork.</p><p>Gold Key featured a number of licensed properties and several original titles (including a number of publications that spun-off from Dell's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/four-color/49-927/\">Four Color</a> series). It maintained decent sales numbers throughout the 1960s, thanks to its offering many titles based upon popular TV series of the day, as well as numerous titles based upon both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/walt-disney-company-italia/57-290/\">Walt Disney Studios</a> and Warner Bros. animated properties. It was also the first company to publish comic books based upon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-trek/49-2364/\">Star Trek</a>.</p><p>Over the years it did lose several properties, including the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-features-syndicate/57-198/\">King Features Syndicate</a> characters (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/popeye/29-32957/\">Popeye,</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash-gordon/29-7953/\">Flash Gordon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-phantom/29-7957/\">The Phantom</a>, etc) in 1966, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hanna-barbera-hi-adventure-heroes/49-34337/\">Hanna Barbera</a> characters (to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a>) in 1970, and Star Trek (to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel Comics</a>) in 1979.</p><p>The stable of writers and artists built up by Western Publishing during the Dell Comics era mostly continued into the Gold Key era. In the mid-60s a number of artists left to work for the newly formed Disney Studio Program. Among the few new creators at Gold Key were writers <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/don-glut/26-57469/\">Don Glut</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/len-wein/26-41457/\">Len Wein</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mark-evanier/26-26413/\">Mark Evanier</a> and artist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mike-royer/26-7366/\">Mike Royer</a>. Also in the 70s writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-gregory/26-31834/\">Bob Gregory</a> started drawing stories, mostly for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daisy-duck/29-21550/\">Daisy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donald-duck/29-22182/\">Donald</a>. Acclaimed artist/writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frank-miller/26-7082/\">Frank Miller</a> had his first published comic book artwork in The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/twilight-zone/49-2102/\">Twilight Zone</a> for Gold Key in 1978.</p><p>According to former Western Publishing writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mark-evanier/26-26413/\">Mark Evanier</a>, during the mid-1960s comedy writer Jerry Belson (whose writing partner at the time was Garry Marshall), while writing for leading TV sitcoms like The Dick Van Dyke Show, also did scripts for Gold Key. Among the comics he wrote for were <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flintstones/49-11612/\">The Flintstones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-best-of-donald-duck-and-uncle-scrooge/49-2197/\">Uncle Scrooge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daffy-duck/49-9559/\">Daffy Duck</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bugs-bunny/49-11508/\">Bugs Bunny</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-three-stooges/49-2100/\">The Three Stooges</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/walter-lantz-woody-woodpecker/49-11012/\">Woody Woodpecker</a>.</p><p>In the 1970s, when the comics industry experienced a downswing, Gold Key was among the hardest hit. Its editorial policies had not kept pace with changing times and suffered erosion of its base of sales among children who could now instead watch cartoons and other entertainment on free television. By 1977, all of the company's original series had been canceled (most had been dropped circa 1973-1974), and its licensed series were virtually all reprint-only, although Gold Key was still able to obtain the rights to publish a comic book series based upon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/buck-rogers-in-the-25th-century/49-3017/\">Buck Rogers</a> in the 25th Century between 1979 and 1981.</p><p>In this period Gold Key experimented with digests which had some success. In a similar vein to explore new markets they produced in the mid-1970s a four volume series with somewhat better production values and printing aimed at the emerging collector market containing classic stories of the Disney characters by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carl-barks/26-23923/\">Carl Barks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/floyd-gottfredson/26-52268/\">Floyd Gottfredson</a> (Best of Walt Disney's Comics). In the late 1970s came somewhat higher grade reprints of various licensed characters also aimed at new venues (Dynabrites) plus a four issue series adapting classic science fiction stories by authors such as Issac Asimov and John W. Campbell (Starstream). Golden Press released trade paperback reprint collections (Walt Disney Christmas Parade, Bugs Bunny Comics-Go-Round, Star Trek Enterprise Logs). And while still distributing comic books on spinners and racks at drug stores, super markets and such under the Gold Key label simultaneously distributing the same comics \u2014 usually in plastic bags of three \u2014 to toy and department stores plus newsstands at airports and bus/train stations \"as well as other outlets that weren't conducive to conventional comic racks\" under the Whitman logo which it also used for such products as coloring books. Western at one point also distributed bagged comics from its rivals DC Comics and Marvel Comics under the Whitman logo. President of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paul-levitz/26-41154/\">Paul Levitz</a> has stated \"The Western program was enormous \u2014 even well into the '70s they were taking very large numbers of DC titles for distribution (I recall 50,000 copies offhand).\" Continued declining sales forced Western in 1981 to cease newsstand distribution and thereafter release all its comics solely in bags as \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whitman/57-68/\">Whitman Comics</a>\". The \"Gold Key\" logo was discontinued. Eventually arrangements were made to distribute these releases to the nascent national network of comic book stores as part of the Whitman alternate methods of distribution. All these efforts proved ultimately unsuccessful, and by 1984 Western was out of the comic book business.</p><p>Many of their characters have been revived over the decades by companies ranging from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valiant/57-485/\">Valiant</a> to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-horse-comics/57-364/\">Dark Horse</a> who recently revived and published some of their more memorable characters.</p><p>Some of the stable of characters that were originally published were:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magnus/29-12457/\">Magnus</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-solar/29-39277/\">Dr. Solar</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/turok/29-7171/\">Turok</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mars-patrol/65-57706/\">M.A.R.S.
