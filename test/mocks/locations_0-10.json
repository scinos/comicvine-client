They also discovered the climate-controlling technology and used it to keep the volcanoes working. They mastered genetic engineering. They experimented on the various species living in the Savage Land, and were then forced to work for the Atlantians until they revolted. The Atlantians used the technology to expand the Savage Land. However, the Atlantians were overthrown and the expanded areas in the Savage Land remained.</p><p>After some years, the Savage Land was discovered by a man named Lord Robert Plunder who took back a metal which could liquefy all other metals. The discovery of this metal meant that others would want to steal his discovery, so he took his eldest son Kevin, and went back to the Savage Land. However, Lord Robert Plunder was killed by a local tribe of Man-Apes, and Kevin grew up in the Savage Land, known better as <a href=\"/ka-zar/29-3558/\">Ka-Zar</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1737425\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1737425-avalon_super.jpg\" title=\"Antarctic\"><img id=\"1737425\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1737425-avalon_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Antarctic\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Antarctic</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, <a href=\"/avalon/34-41283/\">Avalon</a> was the last refuge of Humans and Mutants who wanted to escape <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>\u00b4s tyranny.

His younger sister <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/29-6144/\">  Lilandra</a> and her new allies, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">  X-Men</a>, foiled his plans. He was rendered comatose by the crystal, and Lilandra then took over as the Majestrix of the Shi'ar Empire. The X-Men, as well as most of Earth's other superheroes, have had cordial if not friendly relations with the Shi'ar Empire ever since.<br /><strong>Deathbird</strong> <p>In the 1980s, Lilandra and D'Ken's unstable exiled elder sibling, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathbird/29-6089/\">  Deathbird</a>, made several attempts to overthrow her sister from power. Deathbird even resorted to attacking Lilandra's Earth-based allies in order to achieve her goals. She is also responsible for initially directing the alien parasites known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood/65-4987/\">  Brood</a> towards the Earth and its heroes. Deathbird was eventually deposed with the assistance of the X-Men. In the 1992 crossover <em><i>Operation: Galactic Storm</i></em>, the Shi'ar annexed the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">  Kree</a> Empire at the end of the Kree-Shi'ar War and Deathbird was placed into a prominent position as viceroy of Hala, the Kree homeworld. However, Deathbird did not last long in this position and the current status of the Kree territories is unclear.

Inhabiting the body of her brother, Nova asserts control of Empress Lilandra and causes a Shi'ar civil war. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">  Jean Grey</a> is instrumental in ending this threat.<br /><br /><strong>Phoenix Endsong &amp; End of Greys</strong></p> <p>Even though Jean Grey did the Shi'ar a big favor by eliminating the threat of Cassandra Nova, the Shi'ar still want her dead. In the Phoenix Endsong series, a group of Shi'ar tried to permanently kill the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">  Phoenix Force</a> and Jean Grey. Jean, however, escaped their suicide bomb attack and returned to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/white-hot-room/34-50483/\">  White Hot Room</a> to restore herself. In the recent \"End of Greys\" story arc, the Shi'ar wanted to wipe out the Grey genome and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-omega/29-40583/\">  Quentin Quire</a> with the purpose of eliminating the possibility of a new Omega-level mutant becoming a host for the Phoenix Force. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar-death-commandos/65-55991/\">  Shi'ar Death Commandos</a> murdered Jean Grey's father, niece, nephew, and other relatives in an alien invasion on Earth, thus inciting the wrath of Jean's daughter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">  Rachel Summers</a>, who has vowed vengeance on the entire Shi'ar Empire.

Once he arrived on Earth, Gladiator came into conflict with The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">  Fantastic Four</a> and was forced to face <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-universe/29-27193/\">  Captain Universe</a> (who had merged with The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">  Invisible Woman</a>) in combat,&nbsp;which nearly cost Gladiator his life. The Uni-Power then merged with the badly injured Gladiator and showed him that it did not pose a threat to anyone. After saving Los Angeles from a tsunami, Gladiator extended to The Uni-Power, an invitation to come back with him to The &nbsp;Shi'ar&nbsp;Throneworld&nbsp;as a guest while their scientists tried to solve The Uni-Power's dilemma.<br /><br />Unfortunately while Gladiator and The Uni-Power were en route to the Empire both of them were captured by an energy-consuming reptilian space vampire who called himself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krosakis/29-44347/\">  Krosakis</a>, who not only stripped Gladiator of all his power but also forced The Uni-Power into merging with him, thus turning Krosakis into Captain Universe. Luckily The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">  Silver Surfer </a>was able to sense The Uni-Power's plight and defeated Krosakis by overloading him with The Power Cosmic. The Surfer then&nbsp;permanently infused a portion of The Power Cosmic into The Uni-Power and repaired it, considering all they had been through over the years Gladiator believed The Surfer when he said The Uni-Power had been cured and allowed it to return to Earth while he took Krosakis back to The Shi'ar Throneworld so he could be placed on trial for his crimes.<br /><br /> <h3>Annihilation</h3><br />As the war against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/29-10964/\">  Annihilus</a>' invasion forces&nbsp;tore countless neighboring Star Empires asunder Peter Quill a.k.a.

During his tenure as majestor of the empire, D'Ken killed Vulcan's mother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/katherine-summers/29-15328/\">  Katherine Summers</a> (also mother to long time X-Men Scott and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">  Alex Summers</a>) and made him a slave for most of his adolescent life. Bent on revenge against D'Ken, Vulcan attacks the Empire. Not only that, but within the empire, there is a coup to dethrone Lilandra and return D'Ken to power, with the aid of Deathbird. The X-Men once again team up with their space allies, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">  Starjammers</a>, to stop both Vulcan and the plot to return rulership of the empire to D'Ken. In the end, Vulcan kills his father, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsair/29-7591/\">  Corsair</a>, and D'Ken, and assumes the throne of the Shi'ar Empire for himself, with Deathbird as his queen; Lilandra and the Starjammers now lead a resistance against Vulcan's rule.<br /><br /><strong>Emperor Vulcan</strong></p> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"138740\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/138740-134228-vulcan_super.jpg\" title=\"Vulcan\"><img id=\"138740\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/138740-134228-vulcan_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Vulcan\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vulcan</div></div></div></div>The civil war between Vulcan's forces and those loyal the dethroned Lilandra rages on. Led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">  Havok</a> and the Starjammers, Lilandra's forces gradually whittle away at Vulcan's forces, which are plagued by defections. The Shi'ar, contrary to Vulcan's expectations, are not happy to have an outsider as their ruler. Vulcan is discouraged by this, but Deathbird convinces him that they will come to accept him. Warned in advance of a rebel raid on Feather's Edge, Vulcan and his fleet ambush the Starjammers. However, in the middle of the battle, his ship, the Hammer, is destroyed by the Scy'ar Tal (translates as \"Death to the Shi'ar\"). Vulcan and Gladiator (still the praetor of his Imperial Guard) attack the leader of the Scy'ar Tal and are easily defeated, whereupon they retreat deeper into Shi'ar space. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">  Marvel Girl</a> makes contact with the Eldest Scy'ar Tal and discovers their true origin. The Scy'ar Tal were originally called the M'Kraan. Early in their history, the Shi'ar attacked them, killed a great number of their people, making the rest flee for their lives. Eventually, the Shi'ar settled on their planet, took the M'Kraan Crystal as their own, and passed down the legend of the M'Kraan Crystal as a sacred gift from their deities, Sharra &amp; K'ythri. The M'Kraan then changed their name to Scy'ar Tal and devoted their culture and society to the destruction of the Shi'ar Empire. With their first attack, they destroyed Feather's Edge by transporting a star to obliterate it. After which, Vulcan makes contact with the Starjammers to call a temporary ceasefire. Under the ceasefire, the Shi'ar and the Starjammers decide to take out the Finality, thus crippling the Scy'ar's biggest threat. Once Havok and Vulcan are in position to destroy Finality, the Eldest Scy'ar trys to stop them. Once Vulcan figures out how the Eldest is powered, he severs the connection Eldest has with his brothers, making him powerless. Once the connection is severed, the Scy'ar become unorganized, and the tide of the battle shifts to the Shi`ar. The Shi'ar then proceed to attack both the Scy'ar and the Starjammers. Meanwhile, Vulcan blasts Havok into a sun. Vulcan decides to use Finality to destroy the Scy'ar by using the weapon to place a star in the middle of their fleet. Alex returns and, having absorbed enough power to burn him, decides to end things with Vulcan. While they battle, Rachael and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/korvus/29-41208/\">  Korvus</a> try, but fail to stop the beacon that will initiate the attack by the Shi'ar. The Shi'ar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">  Imperial Guard</a> end Alex's battle with Vulcan by appearing with the Starjammers in captivity, threatening to kill them. Before surrendering, Alex destroys Finality. With Alex and the Starjammers in custody Vulcan declares that he will return the Shi'ar Empire to its former glory.",

        "description":"<h2>Location of Krypton</h2><p><b>Krypton</b> was located close to <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a>, at least in cosmic terms. It was 50 light years from Earth and orbited a red giant star known as <a href=\"/rao/29-45048/\">Rao</a>. Krypton is roughly Earth sized and was part of <a href=\"../../green-lantern/12-41148/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern</a> sector 2813 (Earth is in sector 2814). However, in the story \"Superman: Birthright\", Krypton was said to be in another galaxy, approximately 2.2 million light-years away. Krypton is home to a race of people known as Kryptonians that are similar to humans but are more closely related to Daxamites. Under their red sun, the Kryptonians became a more technologically advanced society.</p><h2>The People and Culture</h2><p>Krypton was a world renowned for its scientific achievement. As a culture, the people lead an idyllic life surrounded by robots and followed a ritual path through life. One of their achievements was their Clone Banks. Their mastery of cloning allowed them to live an eternal youth and their society grew ever more hedonistic. In these banks each Kryptonian would maintain three mindless Clones which could be used as spare parts if their \"owner\" was ever injured. There was growing concern however, that the clones too had rights. At first what started out to be a pacifist movement ended up being The Clone Rights Movement that began with the teachings of Sem-M. One clone gained independent sentience, causing the debate to escalate into conflict. Eventually the Clone Rights Movement formed such a large force that they rebelled against the ruling authority. The advanced scientific knowledge of the Kryptonians was turned into super weapons and Krypton's Clone War began. Two weapons were created at this time, the <a href=\"../../eradicator/29-5377/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eradicator</a> and the Destroyer. The Eradicator had altered the genes of Kryptonians so that they could never leave their planet again. The Destroyer was aimed at the planet's core, by pro-clone forces causing a chain reaction. The Destroyer was stopped when the government ended hostilities and the planet was saved.</p><p>Krypton would never be the same. The world was left with no wildlife and the people began living in isolation from one another and other races. Direct physical contact became prohibited and procreation was facilitated by birthing matrices. Krypton had peace again, but their world was sterile and joyless.</p><p>Daxamites</p><p>The people of <a href=\"../../daxam/34-42416/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daxam</a> originated on Krypton. They left to explore the universe, though they were altered by the Eradicator as they left, leaving them fatally vulnerable to lead.</p><h2>Points of Interest</h2><h3>The Anti-Gravity Sky Palace</h3><p>A marvel of Kryptonian engineering - this domed structure hovers above the planet's surface.</p><h3>Argo City</h3><p>This city was flung into space by a Krypton-quake.

The scientist, <a href=\"../../jor-el/29-9561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jor-El</a> discovered that the planet would soon explode. Jor-El was unable to convince his associates of the impending danger, who could not conceive of leaving Krypton and was himself prevented from leaving. However, he sent his child's birthing matrix to safety shortly before the planet exploded.</p><h2>Notable Residents</h2><p>Krypton is most famous for being the birthplace of Kal-El, better known as <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a>. It was also home to his parents, Jor-El and <a href=\"../../lara/29-9562/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lara</a> and his cousin, Kara Zor-El ( <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>).

Many people looking to add something new to Krypton, trying to find different ways about the dead planet's origin as their inspiration , began to realize that for a planet that exploded had a lot of survivors. So in Superman: The Movie this allowed designer John Barry (who also did Star Wars and A Clockwork Orange) to create Krypton into a crystalline utopia. This version of Krypton featured a highly advanced society, where this planet is crime-free. Criminals will be banished into outer space until the criminal's crime intention was completely erased and he/she will be put to use again after his/her sentence is over.This kind of sentence was completely ignored after Jor-El discovered the Phantom Zone.This Planet Krypton was destroyed due to Krypton's unstable uranium core exploding.</p><p><b>Krypton of Earth-Prime</b></p><p>This version of Krypton is where Superboy-Prime comes from. This Krypton had a unstable red sun that threatened to consume the whole planet. Jor-El and Lara initially tried to build a device that could teleport them across the galaxy. The prototype of the machine that they built was able to carry no more than fifty Kryptonian pounds of weight. <a href=\"/jor-el/29-9561/\">Jor-El</a> knew that the council of science was not considering taking action. At the very last moment when their red sun threatens to consumed their world, he put <a href=\"/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Kal-El</a> in his prototype machine, where the machine transmitted Kal-El's atoms across the galaxy, so the child would be safely rematerialized on Earth. Moments after that, a large radioactive solar flare that was generated by Krypton's red sun completely consumed the entire planet. Everyone there died instantly.</p><p><b>Krypton of Earth-Two</b></p><p>This is where the Golden Age Superman comes from.There is nothing much to know about this Krypton. However, it is stated that everyone of this Krypton possessed super-powers due to their \"millions of years of evolution\",although to a quite lower extant.This Krypton was destroyed due to \"old-age\".</p><h2>Krypton In JLU</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"445754\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/445754-pan06_super.jpg\" title=\"Krypton: In The Mind Of Superman\"><img id=\"445754\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/445754-pan06_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Krypton: In The Mind Of Superman\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Krypton: In The Mind Of Superman</div></div></div></div><p>In the <a href=\"/justice-league-unlimited/65-45101/\">Justice League Unlimited</a> Episode, \"For The Man Who Has Everything\" <a href=\"/mongul/29-12162/\">Mongul</a> enters the <a href=\"/fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/%20\">Fortress of Solitude</a> on Superman's birthday and gives him a gift called the Black Mercy, an animal that attaches to your chest and grants people their every desire. When the animal attached itself to <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>, it made Superman a <a href=\"/krypton/34-30670/\">Krypton</a> and on this planet his parents was still alive and he had a his own wife Loana and son Van-El. After having many tremors and hearing the voices of <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>, he realized that it was all a dream and he had to end up giving up evrything he loved. Despite much pain from having to give up knowing what he had come to love more than anything, he was able to tear away from this dream world, resulting in another destruction of Krypton but this one being nothing more than just a dream.

They hid all of their knowledge in the form of a crystal that was broken into three parts, creating the Stones of Power. The chosen Kryptonian journeyed to the planet Earth where he hid the stones at three different locations; this Kryptonian also came across a tribe of Indians known as the Kawatche and started a new prophecy on Earth about how he would return from the stars to save their world or send another chosen Kryptonian.</p><p><a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Dax-Ur\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dax-Ur</a> was one of the greatest scientists to live on Krypton. He designed the <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Brainiac\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brain InterActive Construct</a>, a self-aware, conscious supercomputer that could permanently run Krypton on a day-to-day basis without the need for manual labor. Dax-Ur then realized the destruction his creation could cause if it fell into the wrong hands and abandoned his designs without completing their construction. He fled Krypton, seeking solace on Earth, where he planned to study the effects that the planet's yellow sun had on various Kryptonian minerals.</p><p>In 1961, Jor-El traveled to Earth as a rite of passage by his father, and unwittingly fell in love with Louise McCallum and met Hiram and Jessica Kent. He left his memories, stored in a memory pendant, behind on Earth and returned to Krypton.</p><p>Jor-El and Lara met sometime after his adventures on Earth, and the two were married sometime before he became a member of the Ruling Council.</p><p>In 1966, a terrible war was fought against the forces of Black Zero, who succeeded in destroying the Kryptonian city of Kandor; among those killed were the wife and young son of Zod who, at that time, was a major in Krypton's military. During this time, the Council commissioned Jor-El to construct an Orb containing the DNA of Krypton's strongest (including Zod and Jor-El himself) with the intent of sending it to Earth so they would be resurrected if Krypton was ever destroyed. Kandor was re-built sometime after its destruction by Black Zero.</p><p>Years after the death of his wife and son, Zod rose to the rank of General, married Faora and began his plans to take over Krypton.</p><h3><span id=\"The_War\">The War</span><span></span></h3><h4><span id=\"Early_War\">Early War</span><span></span></h4><p>Zod was a strong believer in the old barbaric ways of Kryptonian society, and believed that his people had become weak and therefore needed to be dictated. So over the years as he grew in power, he gathered loyal disciples and forces that he would use in an attempt to overthrow the Ruling Council and conquer Krypton. When he believed that he had enough forces, Zod mounted an attack on Krypton, beginning a war with the Council.</p><p>After the war had been going on for some time, Zod had caused damage to the Council, so they asked Jor-El to create Dax-Ur's Brain InterActive Construct to aid in the war against Zod, using its extensive knowledge to help the Council defeat Zod. However, Zod learned of the creation of Brainiac and was able to corrupt it, making it an ally to him and his disciples.</p><p>During this time, Zor-El attempted to kill Jor-El, believing that his brother had stolen Lara from him. After his assassination attempt on Jor-El, he was disgraced as a scientist and became the operator for Kandor's mine. Zod used Zor-El's hatred of Jor-El against Krypton, and Zor-El joined Zod's efforts to take over Krypton.</p><p>Since Zod and Faora were unable to conceive children after trying for so long, they decided that, by using genetic engineering, they would create their own ultimate son. Zod and Faora gathered the DNA of the most violent Kryptonian species and fused them all together with their own DNA. They planned to send their \"<a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Doomsday\" rel=\"nofollow\">son</a>\" to Earth, where he would destroy the population, leaving the planet deserted so that, in case Zod could not rule Krypton, they would rule Earth as a <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/House_of_Zod\" rel=\"nofollow\">family</a> instead.</p><p>Zod gave major roles in the war to his two closest disciples, Aethyr and <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Nam-Ek\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nam-Ek</a>, whom he would let make decisions on where their forces should attack. Nam-Ek and Aethyr often conversed with Zor-El, who would tell them of the Council's plans and where would be best to attack and weaken the Council.</p><h4><span id=\"Leading_to_Krypton.27s_Destruction\">Leading to Krypton's Destruction</span><span></span></h4><p>Krypton began experiencing massive tremors during the war, and the Council asked Jor-El to investigate. Jor-El suspected that the tremors where caused because Zor-El was operating Kandor's mine (the last one remaining not in Zod's hands) at full capacity, mining too deep. When the Council questioned Zor-El, he claimed that, without the mine working at full power, the Council would not have enough resources for the war, and that the tremors were temporary and caused by the attacks suffered during the war. Convinced, the Council allowed Zor-El to continue operating the mine at the same capacity.</p><p>Zor-El, however, had a different agenda. A strong believer in Rao's prophecy, he believed himself to be the chosen Kryptonian who would rise on Earth and create a paradise. Because of this, when he realized that Zod was starting to fulfill the prophecy by ravaging Krypton, Zor-El decided that he would complete the prophecy by igniting the planet's core and destroy Krypton.</p><p>Jor-El and the Council eventually managed to apprehend Zod and most of his followers.Jor-El convinced the Council to destroy all portals leading to Earth in order to prevent the rest of Zod's followers from escaping through them. The Council and Jor-El destroyed Zod's physical body and placed his essence in the Phantom Zone, along with his wife Faora, leaving them with no escape unless they inhabited a Kryptonian vessel.</p><p>After Zod was captured, Jor-El learned about his association with Zor-El. He forced his brother to stop the dangerous mining operations and placed him under arrest by locking him inside the powered-off mine control room. Zor-El was almost finished with the ignition of the planet's core, so he commanded Brainiac to override the lockdown, allowing him to complete the ignition and escape.</p><h3><span id=\"Destruction\">Destruction</span><span></span></h3><p>Zor-El made plans for him and Kara to flee Krypton before its destruction, but she found out about his ties with Zod and tried to expose him. Zor-El, with the help of his disciple Augo, tried to stop Kara, but she was able to notify Lara. When Zor-El tried to stop Kara, she pushed him into a cluster of hologram crystals, injuring him. Zor-El then erased Kara's memory and sent her away to Earth in a spaceship along with a blue crystal that contained his DNA, which could create a clone of him since his injury prevented him from traveling to Earth with Kara.He also put Lara's DNA in the crystal for two reasons: Because of his feelings towards her, and to lure his nephew Kal-El to the crystal should Kara fail to complete her task.</p><p>After Kara contacted Lara, she warned Jor-El about Zor-El's plan to ignite Krypton's core. So they sent their only son Kal-El in a <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Kal-El%27s_ship\" rel=\"nofollow\">spaceship</a> to Earth away from Krypton's doom. Sometime before Kal-El left Krypton, Zod and Faora had attached the genetic matter that was their \"<a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Davis_Bloome\" rel=\"nofollow\">son</a>\" to Kal-El's ship.</p><p>Jor-El placed his assistant <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Raya\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raya</a> in the Phantom Zone to escape while he and Lara went to try and stop Krypton's destruction.</p><p>In 2008, Brainiac traveled with Kara back through time to Krypton just before its destruction, in an attempt to kill Kal-El before he grew up to save Earth. He tracked down Kal-El and his ship, presumably killing Jor-El and Lara, before Kara attempted to stop him. Brainiac easily overpowered Kara (who was powerless due to Krypton's red sun) when Clark arrived from the future; Brainiac overpowered him as well. That distracted him enough for Kara to find a sharp crystal and stab it through Brainiac, weakening him as Clark placed baby Kal-El in his ship, sending him to Earth as planned.</p><p>After Brainiac began igniting the planet's core, he contacted Nam-Ek and Aethyr, and told them that Zod had indeed been placed in the Phantom Zone and that the only way they could release him was to locate the Stones of Power before Kal-El; otherwise, they would have to force Kal-El. The three of them were able to escape from Krypton in another spaceship, known as the <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Ship\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Ship</a>.</p><p>Shortly after they all escaped, Krypton's core eventually ignited, leading to the total destruction of the planet, killing billions of people, including Jor-El, Lara, Zor-El, and the Ruling Council.</p><h2><span id=\"Interplanetary_Relationships\">Interplanetary Relationships</span><span></span></h2><p>Krypton had noticeable relationships with other planets and galaxies, as it was one of the most powerful and advanced civilizations in the universe. Some planets saw Kryptonians as a cold and harsh race. Many other planets looked up to Kryptonians as god-like creatures whereas others would despise their power and greatly hate Kryptonians.</p><p>Some planets, such as Earth and Mars, had good relationships with Krypton, with Kryptonians traveling to Earth frequently via portals. These trips to Earth spawned many Kryptonian connections to Earth, including the birth of the Kawatche tribe and the occult interests in the Stones of Power by the witches Margaret Isobel Thoreaux and her disciples Brianna Withridge and Madelyn Hibbins. Kryptonians, benevolent or otherwise, saw Earth as a paradise due to the powers and abilities they gained under the planet's yellow sun; this caused Earth to become the prime conduit of Krypton's affairs. Martians also had a good relationship with Krypton, as the Martian Manhunter would often go to Krypton to aid his friend Jor-El, but some Kryptonians would look down on Martians as a lower species. The planet Almerac was a distant planet to Krypton, and their young would often be told stories about Krypton, in particular Kryptonian men and about how brave and gallant they were and many Kryptonian men were desired as mates by Almeracian women.</p><p>The destruction of Krypton is well-known throughout the universe, with many species having knowledge of its destruction.</p><h2><span id=\"Notable_Citizens\">Notable Citizens</span><span></span></h2><ul><li><b>Ruling Council</b>: A democratic group that were established and appointed to office sometime after the Kryptonians evolved from strict, lethal warriors to gentle, technologically efficient people.</li><li><b>Jor-El's Father</b>: A citizen of Krypton, and father of Jor-El and Zor-El; he sent his son Jor-El to Earth as a rite of passage in 1961.</li><li><b>Jor-El</b>: The father of Kal-El, Jor-El was a highly-respected scientist on Krypton and an influential member of the Ruling Council.</li><li><b>Lara-El</b>: The mother of Kal-El and loyal wife to Jor-El, Lara was a loving mother and also aunt to Kara, and notified Jor-El about Zor-El's plan to destroy Krypton, giving their son a chance to get off the planet alive.</li><li><b>Kal-El</b>: The son of Jor-El and Lara, Kal-El was born on Krypton a couple of weeks prior to its destruction and sent to Earth by his parents, who believed he would be safe there and destined to save Earth from destruction.</li><li><b>Zor-El</b>: The father of Kara and brother of Jor-El, he caused Krypton's destruction by igniting its core, believing in Rao's prophecy that he would be resurrected on Earth and create utopia.</li><li><b>Dax-Ur</b>: A scientist who designed the Brain InterActive Construct, later dubbed Brainiac.

The planet's terrain was slightly similar to Earth's except for the crystalline architecture of its buildings, its constant cold temperatures and its icy ground; therefore, the <a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortress of Solitude</a>, with its crystalline appearance, is a re-creation of Kryptonian landscape, with its crisscrossing crystal towers. Krypton had oceans that ran between the massive continents of frozen plateaus, much like Earth's geography with its land sea.</p><p>Krypton's climate was cold and still. It is unknown how far Krypton was from its red sun, but had to be close enough to sustain life and water.</p><p>Doomsday is the result of his parents Zod and Faora fusing their genetic matter with DNA taken from the most violent, vicious and malevolent creatures that, apparently, can be found on Krypton; these creatures roamed the planet, and were most likely avoided by most Kryptonians.</p><h2><span id=\"Education\">Education</span><span></span></h2><p>In <i>Kara and the Chronicles of Krypton</i>, Kara attended an educational facility with other young Kryptonians. It was a crystalline structure similar in design to the Fortress of Solitude. The building was destroyed during the war with Zod, after Zor-El planned for it to be attacked by Zod's army in Kandor. Both Kara and Augo narrowly escaped damage from the blast.</p><h2><span id=\"Location\">Location</span><span><a href=\"http://smallville.wikia.com/wiki/Krypton?action=edit&amp;section=12\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a></span></h2><p>Clark tells Chloe Sullivan that he's \"not from anywhere near this galaxy.\" Later, Kara asks Clark how pieces of their home planet traveled through 23 galaxies. There are 28 known and inhabited galaxies in the <i>Smallville</i> universe, so that suggests that Earth and Krypton are very far apart.</p><p>The closest galaxy of comparable scope to the Milky Way Galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy, which is approximately 2,560,000 light-years away. The closest body capable of being called a galaxy is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, approximately 25,000 light-years away. Even if Krypton was in this mini-galaxy, it would still take at least 25,000 years before Earth would notice its disappearance. However, since kryptonite traveled across 23 galaxies, Krypton must be much further away than this.</p><p>We know that Jor-El came to Earth in the early 1960s, therefore meaning that Krypton may have existed at least until 40 years earlier. However, since Kryptonian technology has demonstrated the capacity to manipulate time, it is possible the teleportation portals connected different points in time as well as space. This would be consistent with our present understanding of the consequences of a fold in space-time, or wormhole.</p><p>Also, Dr. Virgil Swann states that he traced the signal from Krypton \"billions of miles\" to where the star should have been. While this is not technically wrong, a more logical and comfortable measure of the distance to the stars would be given in <i>trillions</i> of miles, not billions.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Created by</h2><p>Arkham Asylum was created by <a href=\"/dennis-oneil/26-40861/\">Denny O'Neil</a> (one of the editors for DC) who is also the co-creator of <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra's Al Ghu</a>l, <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/29-4917/\">Talia al Ghul</a> and <a href=\"/man-bat/29-6131/\">Man Bat</a>. In 1974 it was Dennis O'Neil who first explored the deep psychology of Batman's inner ego. It was this that later lead O'Neil to creating a Psych Ward aka Arkham Asylum, which has since inspired origin stories, video games, and graphic novels.</p><h2>Origin</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"225554\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10376/225554-30431-arkham-asylum_super.jpg\" title=\"Welcome to Arkham\"><img id=\"225554\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10376/225554-30431-arkham-asylum_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Welcome to Arkham\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Welcome to Arkham</div></div></div></div><p>The history of Arkham Asylum began in the early 1900s. Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane is named after Elizabeth Arkham, who was the mother of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amadeus-arkham/29-50547/\">Amadeus Arkham</a>, the founder. Amadeus\u2019s mother was suffering from mental illness and eventually committed suicide. Amadeus became the sole heir to the Arkham estate and decided to treat mentally ill patients in order for those to not go through what his mother went though. Amadeus also got married to a woman named Constance and had a daughter name Harriet. He decided to turn his family home into an asylum to treat patients, but while it was being built he treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital, while also living at the Hospital with his family. Eventually the family would move back to their home at the Arkham house, while back at home Arkham was notified by the police that one of his patient named Martin \u201c Mad Dog\u201d Hawkins had escaped from prison.</p><p>On April 1, 1921 Arkham returns home and discovers his wife raped and murdered laying next to their lifeless daughter with \u201cMad Dog\u201d carved on her body. The same year Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane officially opened in November. One of the first patients was Martin Hawkins himself, who Arkham personally insisted on treating. On April 1, 1922 Martin Hawkins was strapped to an electric chair for \u201ctreatment\u201d and was electrocuted to death. The death was covered up as an \u201caccident\u201d and Arkham began to fall into madness, believing that the reason he lives is to be an executioner. Arkham would be institutionalized at his own mental hospital, Arkham Asylum, later in life. Arkham died as an inmate in his own asylum.</p><p>Arkham Asylum would later be used to imprison some truly insane characters, for example, the Joker and Two-Face who were one of the first inmates of Arkham Asylum. Arkham soon came to imprison all of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>\u2019s supervillain enemies whether they are insane or not.</p><h2>Notable Arkham Staff</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/alyce-sinner/29-71931/\">Alyce Sinner</a>: Director of the facility</li><li><a href=\"/aaron-cash/29-57326/\">Aaron Cash</a>: Senior Security Guard</li><li><a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Bruce Wayne</a>: Shareholder</li></ul><h3>Ex-Members of Arkham:</h3><ul><li><a href=\"/jeremiah-arkham/29-27541/\">Jeremiah Arkham</a> - Son of Amadeus.

The castle since the loss of its original owner has been taken care\n of by generations of women taking upon the mantle called the sorceress,\n the first was Queen Veena the wife of King Grayskull. many centuries \npass and the current care taker and now sorceress is <a>         Teela-na</a>, Mother of <a>          Teela</a>.&nbsp; <br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp; The castle itself lies in the lands owned by the eternian kingdom Eternos, which is control by <a>        King Randor</a>, ancient descendant of King Grayskull. much of the history of castle grayskull faded into obscurity and legend as the <a>       Council of Elders</a>\n took over as watchers of Eternia. The Castle sits in the northern \nregion of the evergreen forest of the Light Hemisphere. It would be only\n after the appearance of He-man that the castle becomes a point of \ninterest and a military focal point between the palace of Eternos and \nthe variety of creatures that would seek to gain access to the castle. <br />\n<h2>Other Media<br />\n</h2><div><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/251/337359-31731-castle-greyskull_super.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/251/337359-31731-castle-greyskull_medium.jpg\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption p-4\">&nbsp;Filmation Castle Grayskull\n</div></div></div></div>\n<h3><u>He-man and the Masters of the Universe (Filmation 1983):</u><br />\n</h3>\n&nbsp;Back during the original series, There was no origin of the castle \nstated, only just a legend that it would appear when all hope was lost. \nThis series also does not mention what the secret of castle grayskull \nwas, but that Skeletor was determined to capture, destroy, or get what \never secret there was inside.

The area is monitored by robots, and the specific jail is officially known as the Negative Zone Prison Alpha, yet it is more commonly known as 42. Shortly before <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, an amount of exotic radiation was found within the Negative Zone and held with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quantum-flask/18-55767/\">Quantum Flask</a>.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>After gathering several reports from various spies <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blastaar/29-10963/\">Blastaar</a>, who was recently appointed supreme ruler of The Negative Zone by Emperor <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a> of the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a>, and a massive army of Negative Zone inhabitants have stormed 42 and are preparing for a full-scale invasion of Earth. Peter Quill a.k.a. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starlord/29-10957/\">Star-Lord</a>, who was recently exiled to The Negative Zone by Ronan, is being forced to aid Blastaar in the attack on 42. Thanks to the timely assistance of <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">The Guardians of The Galaxy</a> along with the unregistered super-hero <a href=\"/jack-flag/29-25687/\">Jack Flag</a>; <a href=\"/starlord/29-10957/\">StarLord</a> was able to escape and warned <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a>, <a href=\"/gauntlet/29-42785/\">Gauntlet</a> and Baron Von Blitzschalg about Blastaar's armies.</p><p>The gates to 42 were shut down and The Negative Zone was sealed off from Earth-616. At the same time Blastaar turned 42 into his own personal fortress where he met with the last two surviving members of <a href=\"/the-fraternity-of-raptors/65-56355/\">The Fraternity of Raptors</a> - <a href=\"/talon/29-60703/\">Talon</a> and <a href=\"/darkhawk/29-2111/\">Razor</a> - who forged an alliance with Blastaar and as a sign of good faith gave him The <a href=\"/the-cosmic-control-rod/18-56037/\">Cosmic Control Rod</a>. One major problem has arisen however, due to lack of information transference, <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> knows nothing about Blastaar having taken control of 42 and following the capture of <a href=\"/hardball/29-42784/\">Hardball</a> has reopened the gates to 42. With the gates back online Blastaar and his armies are waiting in hiding as the gates reopen, ready to strike and cross over to Earth-616 at a moment's notice.</p><h2>Other Realities</h2><h3>Fantastic Five</h3><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/big-brain/29-18425/\">Big Brain</a> went offline, the remaining members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-five/65-18424/\">Fantastic Five</a> went to investigate what happened to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>. As well as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-fantastic/29-18426/\">Ms. Fantastic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stinger/29-18431/\">Stinger</a> replaced Big Brain. They found Reed to be protecting his wife Susan, aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> from dying whilst she patched together holes in reality.</p>",

Through an act of philanthropy <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> donated the use the top floors to the Avengers, and had the space outfitted with all of the latest gadgets and security.</p><p>During the events of <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a> Tony Stark let <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a> and his <a href=\"/mary-jane/29-13380/\">family</a> stay in the tower. After Peter turned against Tony and sided with <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Steve Rogers</a>, he was kicked out. Later, Avengers Tower was used by Tony's Pro-Register Team, the <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a>.</p><p>After the tower's destruction during <a href=\"/world-war-hulk/39-42294/\">World War Hulk</a>, Tony rebuilt it using <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> funds. Tony was eventually removed from his position as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the wake of the <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, and replaced by <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> who took possession of all of Stark's belongings while reforming S.H.I.E.L.D. into <a href=\"/hammer/65-56065/\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> (this included the tower, which he then made headquarters for his own <a href=\"/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Avengers</a> team).</p><p>Soon after the fall of Norman Osborn and the <a href=\"/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> during the <a href=\"/siege/39-55985/\">siege</a> on <a href=\"/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a>, Sentry's watch tower disappeared after his death. It had formally existed atop of Avengers Tower. Tony Stark was then given back the building, after which <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> placed a pillar on top to let the world know that both Earth (Midgard) and Asgard are allies.</p><p>The main tower is 93 stories high, and measures roughly 1130 feet in height (without including the now additional Asgardian pillars) The Avengers section of the building, also houses sufficient space for the many Avengers members, a communications room, hooked to various other important organizations, a general Avengers library (electronic), a forensics laboratory, a war room, a pathology research wing, and various hangars for various Quinjets and helicopters. The non related Avengers areas feature a children's hospital (Maria Stark Memorial Children's Hospital) and a substance abuse clinic.</p>",
