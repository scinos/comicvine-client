        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The first incarnation of The Brotherhood of Mutant appeared in 1964. This group was originally created by Magneto, one the X-Men's greatest enemies. The original members of the team included <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> (the leader), <a href=\"/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a>, <a href=\"/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a>. Scarlet Witch felt obligated to remain with Magneto because he had saved her from an angry mob that was intent on killing her. Quicksilver, her brother, served Magneto begrudgingly while Scarlet Witch felt obligated to do so.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Brotherhood of Mutants was created by the writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1964. The team made its first appearance in the comic book <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/49-2133/\">X-Men</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-the-brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/37-7032/\">#4</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Brotherhood of Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"284968\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/284968-38922-brotherhood-of-evil_super.jpg\" title=\"Original\"><img id=\"284968\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/284968-38922-brotherhood-of-evil_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Original\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Original</div></div></div></div><p>Early in his war against humanity, <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a> organized a small band of mutants to go into combat at his side. Since the world had branded him a criminal, Magneto defiantly named his team of accomplices \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/17652/\">The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>.\" The most subservient of the group was <a href=\"/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a>, named both for his grotesque appearance and his superhuman leaping ability. There was also <a href=\"/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, who could mentally create utterly convincing illusions. Lastly , there was <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a>, who could move at superhuman speed, and his sister, the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>, who could alter probability at will. Neither <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a> nor the two siblings knew at the time that he was actually their father by his estranged wife Magda.</p><p>Time, and again, the Brotherhood clashed with the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/3173/\">X-Men</a>, until Magneto was captured by an extraterrestrial being known as Stranger. Tired of Magneto's war, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch soon joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/3806/\">Avengers</a> Super Hero team. Magneto later reorganized the Brotherhood three more times, adding new members such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blob/3182/\">Blob</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/unus/3438/\">Unus</a>, and Lorelei, before abandoning the concept entirely.</p><h3>Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"679940\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/679940-mystique06_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique's Brotherhood\"><img id=\"679940\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/679940-mystique06_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique's Brotherhood\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique's Brotherhood</div></div></div></div><p>Subsequently, the mutant terrorist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystique</a> formed her own Brotherhood.

They were not Young Justice at this point but the two did get a better understanding from each other that led them to feel that they could get a lot from each other by talking about the problems they have being a hero with someone who would have an idea what it was like.</p><p>Later <a href=\"../../tim-drake/29-9290/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robin</a>, <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy</a> and <a href=\"../../bart-allen/29-1680/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Impulse</a> interceded on behalf of a <a href=\"../../deo/65-47222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">D.E.O.</a> \"cleaner\" team transporting a gaseous entity known as <a href=\"../../secret/29-1682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret</a> to the Wabe Facility for disposal. Working together, the teens were able to rescue \"Secret\" from her D.E.O. captors. This did not sit well with their adult counterparts and they were investigated for their involvement in the case by the adult heroes.</p><p>The team was asked to capture the \"Bottle Girl\" they were told it was a dangerous monster and could kill anyone it came into contact with. Worried that the D.E.O. would not be able to catch her they asked the three superheros to help. The team did capture the creature but not without some growing pain. Because they weren't an official team at this point they all had problems working as a team. They wanted to do it their way and it was not until they worked as a team did they capture the creature. When they did capture her they found that it was not really a monster but a girl at about their age.</p><p>She told them her story and asked is they could help her. They agreed to help and gave the D.E.O. a fake canister that was suppose to have the creature. This is what cased the investigation by their adult counterparts. The team was afraid that the girl would go back to the D.E.O. so they all agreed to lie and told them all the same story.</p><p>The team later went camping at the old <a href=\"../../justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice League of America</a>'s cave headquarters. They were goofing around and Impulse wrote graffiti all over they place with blue paint. He even wrote Hanson bite across the chest of what he thought was a statue of <a href=\"../../red-tornado/29-1688/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Tornado</a>. Then Red Tornado became so annoyed that he reactivated surprising the teen heroes. Red Tornado would later become the guardian of the team. At this time however everything was interrupted when everyone heard a loud noise.</p><p>When they went to investigate they found that a strange thing had happened at an archeology site. By the time they got there police and reporters were already there. Also there were Agents <a href=\"../../agent-donald-fite/29-11994/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fite</a> and <a href=\"../../maad/29-22949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maad</a>. Fite and Maad were agents of <a href=\"../../apes/65-57486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.P.E.S.</a> (All-Purpose Enforcement Squad). The two would later become long term adversaries for the the team. At the archeology dig one of the reporters by the name of <a href=\"../../ace-atchinson/29-72661/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ace Atchinson</a> asked the team is they were the <a href=\"../../teen-titans/65-19081/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teen Titans</a>. Superboy said no. Then Ace said oh you are the young Justice League of America. Then Impulse said \"no,..we're young but Just us\" Oh said Ace, Young Justice and the name stuck.

Most of their ongoing series was written by <a href=\"../../peter-david/26-40682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter David</a>.

The female parts of the group join shortly after the team is formed. <a href=\"../../arrowette/29-1685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arrowette</a> is rescued by the Super-Cycle while the guys were in Spain trying to stop a thief named <a href=\"../../tor-an/29-38017/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tora</a>. They find her at their head quarters after they leave Spain and Secret and Wonder-Girl go there later.

Adopting the <a href=\"../../justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\" rel=\"nofollow\">JLA</a>'s \" <a href=\"../../secret-sanctuary/34-56257/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Sanctuary</a>\" in Happy Harbor, Rhode Island as their de facto headquarters, the team soon found themselves on their first adventure unearthing an ancient vehicle appearing to be a so-called \"Super-Cycle\" of <a href=\"../../new-genesis/34-41471/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Genesis</a> origin. Meanwhile, former Justice League member <a href=\"../../red-tornado/29-1688/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Tornado</a> awoke from stasis and became the mentor to the fledgling team, who had accidentally acquired the name <i>\"Young Justice\".</i></p><h3>New Members</h3><p>Soon after, some girlpower was added when <a href=\"../../wonder-girl/29-10885/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wonder Girl</a>, <a href=\"../../arrowette/29-1685/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arrowette</a> and <a href=\"../../secret/29-1682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret</a> joined the team.

Before any decisions could be made, a mysterious cybernetic girl known as <a href=\"../../indigo/29-3408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Indigo</a> emerged from the future.

Meanwhile, members of Young Justice, especially Wonder Girl, felt responsible for the tragic deaths.

A year later, Green Arrow introduced Speedy as his partner.</p><p>Inspired by his Justice League colleagues, Aquaman offered both Garth and Kaldur'ahm a position to become his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 after they saved him from Ocean-Master. Kaldur became Aqualad.Flash was not fond of the idea of the responsibility of a sidekick, but his nephew Wally differed. He recreated the accident that gave his uncle his super speed power. Partly out of guilt, Flash let him become his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, naming him Kid Flash.</p><p>Before the Cadmus incident, the four sidekicks knew each other; and Robin entrusted Kid Flash with his secret identity. However, the four of them had never been together all at the same time. Last to take a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was Martian Manhunter. Miss Martian claimed she had won the right to become her uncle's sidekick after winning a competition on Mars, though this may not entirely be accurate, as Martain Manhunter has claimed he found M'gann stowed aboard his ship, and claimed to be his niece.</p><h4><span id=\"Present\">Present</span></h4><p>The Justice League arrived at the scene of the destroyed Cadmus facility, and Batman was not happy. He did not, however, expect the young heroes to rebel against the League. They insisted they did good work, and wanted to work together more. Batman asked for three days to plan things.</p><p>Batman gathered the four in the old Justice League hideout inside Mount Justice. They would become a team, on Justice League's terms, handling covert ops missions. They were introduced to the fifth member of the Team, Miss Martian.</p><p>Kid Flash was eager to let Speedy join, but he declined, claiming their \"junior Justice League was a joke\". He was not interested in fighting on the Justice League's terms, and claimed he was tired of them telling him what to do.</p><p>After several missions, Batman and Green Arrow noticed Artemis had been following the Team in the fight against Amazo, and offered her membership.</p><p>Artemis was introduced to the Team the next day, and got off to a rocky start with Kid Flash, who still wanted Speedy on the Team.</p><p>Zatanna moved into the Cave with the Team, after her father was taken as a permanent host by Nabu.</p><h3><span id=\"Members\">Members</span></h3><h4><span id=\"Team_members\">Team members</span></h4><ul><li><b>Robin (Dick Grayson):</b> the most experienced crime fighter, yet youngest of the Team, Robin is an expert in all things technology.

        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>In the latter half of the 30th Century, the Warlords of the planet Khundia sent their first challenge to Earth, threatening to deatroy it and conquer the United Planets. The ruling warlord, Garlack, had decided that the Legion of Super Heroes represented the greatest barrier to the conquest of the UP and he sent Nemesis Kid to secretly infiltrate their ranks. He was captured and the planned invasion repelled, but the Khunds remeained a deadly threat.</p><p>Khundia itself is perpetually eclipsed by its own moon, making it a dark and dreary world. Choking onits own overly dense population, the world has become totally overrun by a mentality of total militarism and violence. Even a person jostled in the streets will settle the ensuing argument in the so caled court of combat, a form of trial by combat, which is often fatal.</p><p>The Khunds have been involved in a subsequent invasion of earth as the dupes of Mordu and the Dark Circle. The UP and the Khunds went through a nominal period of peace, but that always remained fragile as border incidents and terrorist acts by Khundish groups continued to occur. Among the notable Khunds who have battled the Legionnaires and menaced Earth are; Field Marshall Lorca, one of the most brilliant Khund strategists and Kharlak, a championof the challenge courts. Humiliated by his inability to defeat the members of the LSH, Kharlak underwent exotic surgery an dbecame a cyborg with technological powers in an attempt to gain revenge. <br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h2>Other Media</h2> <h3>Justice League Unlimited</h3>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2278944\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69193/2278944-khunds.png\" title=\"   Khunds in Justice League Unlimited.\u00a0 \"><img id=\"2278944\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69193/2278944-khunds_thumb.png\" alt=\"   Khunds in Justice League Unlimited.\u00a0 \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">   Khunds in Justice League Unlimited.\u00a0 </div></div></div></div> \nThe Khunds are seen in the \"Shadow of the Hawk\" episode of the Justice League Unlimited series.

        "description":"<h2>Biology</h2><p>Predators-or, in their tongue, Yautja-are large bipedal, humanoid <a href=\"/aliens/12-46567/\">aliens</a>. They stand anywhere from 6-8 feet in height and weigh hundreds of pounds. Their body is very muscular; due to their lifestyle-and, presumably, diet-very little of their body weight consists of fat. The colour of their skin varies from individual to individual-sometimes it is a pasty yellow, a light or dark green, or gray. They almost always wear masks when they go on hunting excursions, and as a result their faces are rarely seen. They are very distinct, and nothing like a humans. They have small, green or yellow eyes and large broad foreheads. Their mouth is covered by four mandibles and behind those are another mouth-a sort of \"mutated crab\" appearance. On the back of their head are long tubes that resemble dreadlocks.</p><p>Physically, Yautja are faster, stronger, and more durable than any human-they have shown the speed to evade bullet fire, the durability to take bullets and explosions, and the strength to punch through concrete. Unlike ours, their blood is a neon green-easily seen by it's distinct colour. It is uncertain but believed that all of their sense are superior to humans as well-however, they can also use the systems built into their masks to have heightened vision in many different ways, and increase their hearing capabilities. They need to breath air to survive, and prefer a hot, humid environment (although they can still survive in cold conditions easily, as a trio of young Yautja walked the ice of deep <a href=\"/antarctica/34-55940/\">Antarctica</a> with no support). They live longer than humans can possibly hope for, possibly into the hundreds of years.</p><h2>Society</h2><p>It is believed, but not confirmed that Yautja males stay with their mothers for a long period of time until they mature. Their first rite of passage is the binding of the \"dreadlocks\" to their heads-this process is said to be extremely painful and lasts for upwards of a month. If the young Yautja moves or shows any sign of the pain, the ritual is to be attempted again and again until successful.</p><p>The entire civilization of the Yautja revolves around the Hunt. While most species would pick a satisfactory area and stay with it, the Yautja move from planet to planet and area to area, based off of the hunting conditions. The most important ritual that a Yautja will have to pass is the first Hunt-alone, or in a small group, they leave the rest of their clan to hunt one of the most prized prey, \"The Serpents\", or as humans would call them, \" <a href=\"/aliens/65-20659/\">Xenomorphs</a>\" or \"Aliens\". If successful, the Yautja will receive his more advanced weapons (Plasmacaster, energy bolts, etc.), and be invited onto more hunts. The Yautja bears a scar on it's forehead, generated by the acidic blood of the Xenomorphs, proving that he killed a Xenomorph. If a Yautja were to flee and return without evidence or proof, he would commit suicide with a sacrificial dagger, which is the ultimate disgrace. After successful completion of the ritual, the Yautja are considered of the Young Blood class. The mark on their forehead is not only a sign of respect, but one to mark which clan they belong to-every mark is different and exclusive to one clan.</p><p>Young Blood's are viewed as ambitious and reckless. They bear the trophy of their first kill-the skull of the Xenomorph-as a symbol of power. After holding the title for a length of time, the Yautja are simply known as Blooded Hunters.</p><p>While initially they may appear to be ruthless, brutal, and savage, the Yautja and their hunts are really governed by a strict code of ethics, much like the <a href=\"/samurai/12-55836/\">Samurai</a>. It promotes honor, skill, and loyalty to the Clan. Those that follow this codes will not kill the female or weak of the prey species, as it is dishonorable to kill those that cannot defend themselves (though not always the case, as some females are well worthy of hunting).</p><p>The Yautja that strictly follow and believe in the code are of the Warrior class. The Warrior Yautja travel across the universe solo, looking for worthy hunts. Many Yautja are of this class.</p><p>When a Yautja demonstrates great honor, skill, and determination, they are viewed with respect. If it is great enough, they may be promoted to the Elder class. The Elder's of the Yautja are of the highest respect and of most honor. They are the oldest, the wisest, the most skilled. They are the greatest Predators that have ever lived. Elders often have spared other species that have demonstrated such honor, usually from either defeating or fighting in line with a fellow Yautja. The Elders view these individuals as equals, regardless of species or gender.</p><p>The lowest of the ranks in the Yautja society are that of the Bad Blood. They are the disgraced Yautja, those that have disgraced the Hunt, broken the codes and performed other foul deeds. There are two classes to counteract the Bad Blood-the Honoured class, those who are skilled in all ways but not quite Elders, and the Arbitrators, the Yautja law enforcement. They are permitted to eliminate any Bad Blood on sight. Bad Bloods travel alone, running constantly. Some may be misunderstood, but others are evil and kill anything they see-perhaps even other Yautja.</p><p>In the female society, not much is for certain. It is known, however, that they are larger than the males, and possibly stronger. They stay in the dwelling while the males hunt, and care for the young Yautja-they are extremely protective of their young.</p><h2>Communication and Language</h2><p>The Yautja language is complex-they have both a full alphabet as well as slang. Their verbal language consists of chirps, roars, and barks. Most well known of their verbal ways is their chilling, nerve-racking laughter.</p><p>They have a sign language that they use to silently communicate while on the hunt. Among these signs are movements of their mandibles to show emotions. The three most common signs go as followed-lower mandibles spread means aggression, mandibles flared means anger, and having mandibles flared as well as arched is pure rage.</p><h2>Civilization and Methods</h2><h3><b>Homeworld</b></h3><p>It has not been discovered whether or not the Yautja have a specific home world. It is likely that they originated from a specific planet, but as with their nomadic ways it is almost impossible to directly pinpoint the first planet. As it is, the Yautja inhabit many different planets for different Clans. For a home world to support a species such as the Yautja, it must have a few requirements, and thus we can describe what must the origin home world had been like. The Yautja breath air-thus, the planet must have been much like our own, able to support life easily. Due to the hot preferences of the Yautja, it is likely that the planet was hot and humid, with a large amount of plants giving out the natural gases necessary for them to survive. In the movie Alien Vs. Predator-Requiem, the lead Yautja, <a href=\"/wolf/29-50380/\">Wolf</a>, leaves his lair on a jungle planet. This supports that the Yautja most likely colonize or originated from a hot, humid, forested environment. It's also likely that it had multitudes of alien life on the planet-perhaps enforcing the Hunt mentality onto the Yautja.</p><p>Since the vision of the Yautja seem to be in infra-red mode, it is possible that the home world's sun, or light source, was very far away-making the planet dark and the Yautja's vision necessary to survive.</p><p>As for the Yautja's superhuman durability, strength, and speed, it's possible that the planet from which they originated from had a much higher gravity than ours, making the Yautja need to evolve in order to survive. It's also possible that, with the trees and other dangerous life forms, the Yautja evolved in order to become acrobatic as the easily move in the jungle environment.</p><h3>Government</h3><p>It is not known how-other than the Hunt mentality-the Yautja civilization controls itself and maintains order. It's possible that, with the Elders representing their individual clans, there is a Senate or group of Yautja who form the decision makers of the species.</p><p>It is also possible that instead, a war was fought, with the dominant Clan forming a total dictatorship over the others. It would face much opposition if true.</p><p>The final theory is that, since female Yautja are in greater number and possibly stronger than the males, they dominate the civilization in all other aspects of life besides the Hunt. Then, it is easy to assume that a single leader controls the species-a Yautja Queen.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>The Yautja''s technology is superior to humans and much more advanced. It is unknown whether or not the Yautja created this technology.</p><p>While on a Hunt, a Yautja will carry a large pack of equipment in it's belt, backpack, or different storage compartments. Different Yautja personalize their equipment in different ways, but generally this is the equipment present on a Hunt.</p><h3>Mask</h3><p>A standard for every respected Yautja hunter-the mask is an invaluable tool while on a Hunt. Contained within it's operating systems are different types of vision (including Infra-red, motion sensing, and night-vision, among others), sound improvements, and breathing aids. It also includes a sort of word-copy device, which allows the Yautja to communicate with alien life by mimicking the sounds it heard earlier. Also in the masks systems is a tracking device for any shoulder-mounted weapon.</p><p>Every mask is created by the Yautja that wears it, and thus, no two are alike.</p><p>Body Wire Mail</p><p>This is the basic clothing of a Yautja while hunting. It provides electricity-generated heat to keep the hunter warm in cold climates, and also serves as a component to their cloaking device. It is worn under the armour of a Yautja, and covers the entire body with a padding or mesh.</p><h3>Armour</h3><p>The armour that a Yautja wears while hunting is a single plate comprised of unknown metal-like everything created by the Yautja. It is light and maneuverable, but can still take heavy blows. Some armour is even capable of resisting the acidic qualities of Xenomorph blood.</p><p>There is another type of armour used only for ceremonies, but that is more for show than actual defense.</p><h3>Cloak</h3><p>The cloak is a invaluable piece of equipment to a Yautja while on the hunt. It bends the lightwaves around the hunter, and makes them almost totally invisible to the naked eye. However, it isn't foolproof-a shimmer can be seen while the Yautja is moving, much like a heatwave. The cloaking seems to disrupt or malfunction while surrounded by water, so it is likely that it is unused in a fog or raining environment.</p><p>Mounted weapons are cloaked by the effect, but once they are revealed and combat ready (such as a extend-able spear) they become fully visible.</p><h3>Wrist Blades</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1276946\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18154/1276946-lame_de_poignet_wrist_blade_super.jpg\" title=\"The Yautja Wrist Blades\"><img id=\"1276946\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18154/1276946-lame_de_poignet_wrist_blade_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Yautja Wrist Blades\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Yautja Wrist Blades</div></div></div></div><p>The Wrist Blades are arguably the most used weapon by a Yautja. They are range from twelve to eighteen inches long, are almost totally indestructible, and are capable of cutting straight through bone. They are either of straight, pointed design or more stylistic with ridges and curves for maximum cutting power.</p><p>However, they have shown significant vulnerabilities to Xenomorph blood.</p><h3>Plasma Caster</h3><p>The <a href=\"/plasma-caster/18-56382/\">Plasma Caster</a>, or Shoulder Cannon, is the most deadly weapon that a Yautja will carry on a normal hunt. It is controlled by the targeting system inside the mask, and fires rapid, long range plasma pulses capable of killing a Xenomorph in one shot.</p><p>It can be fired either by the hand or by a trigger inside the helmet via mandible.</p><h3>Med Kit</h3><p>It may not be capable of killing, but it is just as useful as any weapon. The Med Kit is a small kit that a Yautja carries with them in case of medical emergencies. It contains supplies to stop bleeding from gunshot wounds as well as heal the body internally. However, it seems more painful to use than to deal with the wound-most Predators roar in fury and pain when they apply the medicine.</p><p>It also includes emergency breathers, surgical blades, and a medicine crystallizer, among other things.</p><h3>Spear Gun</h3><p>The Spear Gun is a weapon that can fire long range, spear-like projectiles form a far distance-the Yautja equivalent to a sniper rifle. The bolts can either kill instantly or impale a target against a wall or obstacle.</p><p>There are two modules of the Spear Gun-one is built in to the Yautja's wrist compartment, and the other is a larger weapon that must be carried around individually.</p><h3>Naginata</h3><p>The Naginata is a bladed weapon of similar design as a partisan. It can be either one-sided or dualed, and the Yautja in question wields it like a bow-staff. It is very ceremonial and a respected weapon. It is made of nigh-unbreakable alloy and can be used for either cutting or stabbing strikes.</p><h3>Dagger</h3><p>The Dagger used by the Yautja is for skinning their first kill-a Xenomorph, and for their first rite in order to put a scar upon their forehead signifying the kill. It is either constructed from the bones or is coated with the skin of the Xenomorph, making it immune to the acidic qualities within their blood.</p><h3>Net Launcher</h3><p>The Net Launcher is a small weapon, either carried or inside of the wrist compartment, that, when fired, launches out a net made of unknown steel. Should it wrap around a target, it will gradually close tighter and tighter until the target is killed. The pressure can be released by the Yautja should he feel the need.</p><p>It has been shown to be vulnerable to the acid blood of Xenomorphs, as the bleeding alien burned through the steel and killed it's Yautja attacker.</p><h3>Combi-Stick</h3><p>The <a href=\"/combi-staff/18-56384/\">Combi-Stick</a> is a spear that first appears very small, but once a button is pressed on the outside it extends in both ways. It is very sharp on both ends, like a spear, and is wielded like a bow-staff. It can be thrown to puncture targets from afar, and when it is swung electricity surrounds both tips to maximize cutting power.</p><p>There are many different designs of the Combi-Stick, and some have been shown to be even triple pronged to one side.</p><h3>Smart Disc</h3><p>The <a href=\"/smart-disc/18-56250/\">Smart Disc</a> is one of the most useful weapons in a Yautja's inventory. It is a round, slim disc with razor edges. When thrown, a heat field is generated around it, increasing the already impressive cutting power of the weapon. Internal gyros ensure that it returns to it's thrower, but should it become stuck in a solid object a press of a button will have it come flying back.</p><p>It was once shown to easily cut straight through several frozen cow carcasses and then straight through a man who was fleeing the Yautja hunter.</p><h3>Shuriken</h3><p>The Shuriken is much like the Smart Disc, but of more stylistic design and slightly more primitive. When hidden, the Shuriken is a small, slim, round disc, but at the push of a button it extends and several long razor edges protrude outwards and it becomes a multi-edges throwing star. Like the Smart Disc, it has internal devices to always ensure that the weapon returns to the wielder once thrown.</p><p>It can be used for either close combat or long range attacks, and has been shown as able to cut straight through a fully grown Xenomorph.</p><h3>Burner</h3><p>The Burner is the most devastating weapon a Yautja can carry with himself. Due to their destructive power, they are not normally carried on simple hunts as they are viewed as dishonorable. The Burner is a weapon that fires out either large explosives fireballs or huge streams of flame. They are used only for raids on Xenomorph colonies to seize a new queen. It was once recorded showing a Burner take the head off of a fully-grown Queen with one shot.</p><h3>Self-Destruct Device</h3><p>The wrist compartment can be used for many things-changing vision modes, language mimics, but the most dangerous is the self-destruct mechanism, a Predator's most powerful weapon. Should a Yautja warrior be defeated, this is his last act to ensure honor. The countdown can be set, but once it reaches zero a semi-nuclear explosion erupts in a 360 degree radius and destroy anything in the vicinity. The Device can be detached if needed.</p><h2>Space Travel</h2><p>There are different forms and classes of Yautja space ships, and are used in different situations. However, many are used for the purpose of only one thing-the Hunt.</p><h3>Individual Shuttle</h3><p>If necessary to initiate a Hunt, a small, one Yautja large shuttle will be launched from a larger ship with a Yautja still inside. It's course cannot be altered, and thrusters on the back of the small shuttle are used to punch through the atmosphere of the target planet. Once through the atmosphere, reverse thrusters are used to slow the descent of the shuttle. They impact in a upright position and then open for the Yautja to exit. They cannot be used to leave a planet-it is a one-way trip.</p><h3>One-Hunter Shuttle</h3><p>A ship large enough for one Yautja to live in and store his equipment and trophies. It contains basic navigation systems and is used for short interplanetary travel. It can be landed onto a planet and cloaked, or bury itself underground and await for it's owner to return.</p><h3>Clan Ships</h3><p>These large ships can transport entire Clans. They are of unique design for each individual Clan and are capable of long range travel. They are controlled by the most respected hunters of each Clan and provide comfortable living quarters for each Yautja on board.</p><p>It is also capable of trapping a <a href=\"/alien-queen/29-52594/\">Xenomorph Queen</a> and has a egg processor, so as to prepare the ritual for new Yautja warriors.</p><h3>Mothership</h3><p>A class rumoured to exist, it is a mobile space base capable of supporting hundreds of Yautja within it's decks as well as housing numerous craft for hunting expeditions. It almost never would itself go out on a Hunt, leaving that to smaller Clan crafts. Here, Yautja can seek a mate, battle for respect and honor, or trade new equipment.</p><h2>Comics</h2><p>The first comics in the Predator series are focused around Detective Mike Shaefer who is the brother of Dutch (Arnold's character) He is determined to find his brother since Dutch has disappeared after the events in the first movie. Since the launch of the series their have been numerous crossover involving famous or well known characters, Including <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> vs Predator, <a href=\"/magnus/29-12457/\">Magnus Robot Fighter</a> vs Predator, <a href=\"/judge-dredd/29-30061/\">Judge Dredd</a> vs Predator, <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> vs Predator, and the most well known crossover Aliens vs Predator, just to name a few.</p><p>During the Aliens Versus Predator series, their first meeting published on a comic takes place on a recently colonized planet called Ryushi. The settlers, unknown of the planet's historical use to the Predator as a hunting ground, raise cattle for export to nearby planets. Meanwhile, a Predator ship approaches the planet for initiation rites for new potential hunters. They prepare their prey to let loose on the planet, which are eggs of a Xenomorph Queen. When the eggs are released by the Predator hunters, they quickly infect the planet. When the Predator hunting party sets foot on the planet, they unsuspectingly come into contact with human settlers in which a battle is commenced and the Predator leader, Broken Tusk is captured and wounded. The hunters soon decide that the humans are their newest prey and decide to hunt them.</p><p>Elsewhere, the infected colony known as Rhynth has loaded their shipment of cattle which among the infected livestock is one with a Queen growing inside that escaped the Predator ship and an Alien hive starts to grow. Soon Aliens start to attack the predators and humans who are clutched in a battle. Broken Tooth soon recovers due to the aid of a human doctor and he decides to side with the humans to destroy the Aliens. During the new alliance and fight, Broken Tooth is nearly killed and with the last of his strength left, he marks a human, Machiko Noguchi the leader of the colony with the sign of Broken Tooth's clan. At the end of this brutal story, <a href=\"/machiko-noguchi/29-69051/\">Machiko</a> is visited by a rival clan of Broken Tooth and their leader accepts her as a member of the hunt.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Brief History<br /></h2><p>Set 15 years in the future in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mc2/12-43721/\"> MC2</a> universe, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\"> Fantastic Four</a> are no more. Originally, this is due to The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\"> Invisible Woman</a> being missing, presumed dead. The only remaining members of the Fantastic Four are The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\"> Human Torch</a> and The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\"> Thing</a>. The group is completed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-fantastic/29-18426/\"> Ms. Fantastic</a> (Lyja, Johnny Storm's wife), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\"> Franklin Richards</a> (Reed Richards and Susan Storm's son) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/big-brain/29-18425/\"> Big Brain</a> (a robot with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\"> Mr. Fantastic</a>'s intellect).</p>\n<p>The Big Brain robot hides a far more sinister secret, only hinted at with Reed Richards' voice speaking from the shadows hidden within the Baxter Building, implying that some kind of inter-dimensional or teleporter disaster might have trapped Invisible Woman and left Mr. Fantastic a warped monster. It is possible that Big Brain is not a cyborg but rather a H.E.R.B.I.E. Later, it is revealed that Big Brain was remotely controlled by Mr. Fantastic from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\"> Negative Zone</a>. Upon Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman's return later in the MC2 universe the roster is Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, the Thing and Lyja. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kristoff-vernard/29-11829/\"> Kristoff </a>is an acting member of the team. In training to become members are Franklin Richards, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/torus-storm/29-22920/\"> Torus Storm</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jake-grimm/29-32186/\"> Jake </a>and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rad/29-59919/\"> Alyce Grimm</a>.&nbsp; After Mr. Fantastic becomes comatose while facing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\"> Doctor Doom</a>, the Invisible Woman stays with her husband.

Similar circumstance that created the real Earth's Fantastic Four, created one for their world too. However, with minor differences, Reed Richards became a power crazed mad scientest, and named himself Mr. Fatal. He then mutated the Thing with gamma radiation and renamed him the Brute. Johnny Storm's powers went out of controland he was forced to wear a stablizer suit and renamed, Blowtorch. Some time later, Peter Parker, known as the Spider, who had gotten his powers in an accident, joined the team to further his own mad quest to examin other powered beings.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Then years later, after the death of Sue Ricards, Reed's son, Franklin joined the group as the powerful telepath, Psi-Slayer. Together, the Fatal Five were born. A group dedicated to take out the various forces that tried to destroy their world order. Now, with their leader gone, the Fatal Five are one of the few villain groups left on their Earth as they fight the growing rebal causes on their world. They tried to take down the rebels by taking<br />Captain America and Storm Trooper prisoner. American Dream, Thunderstrike and Spider-girl eventually fought the team and defeated them. Though Spider-girl had the hardest time against the Spider, since it was her own father she was fighting. Following the freeing of Captain America and Stormtrooper, the small group of Avengers left the alternate Earth to rejoin their fellow Avengers on their Earth.

        "description":"Originally working in a standard military sense, the Web has recently augmented their forces with paranormal warriors...&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<p> Funded by a vast array of anonymous corporate concerns, the Medusa Web works towards its goal in an odd fashion. You see, it plans on forcing the world to unite against a singular foe it perceives to be greater than its component nations - namely, the Medusa Web! Ruyanev and Panagitis were well on their way towards making their goal a reality when it happened. </p><p>The White Event, a strange astronomical phenomenon that occurred late in 1986, was seemingly unimportant until it was discovered that it left several people in its wake with paranormal powers. Panagitis was one of those people. After the Event, he'd developed the power of languages; coupled with his natural charisma and vast tactical skills, this made Panagitis the ideal leader of the Web. </p>Realizing that he probably wasn't the only man to have developed strange and wonderful powers, Panagitis decided to go recruiting, looking for others like himself, others with powers that were more than human. <br />&nbsp; <br />He'd collected about a dozen paranormals, and had them specially trained to be paramilitary operatives, in exchange for lots and lots of money and a generally cushy life (when they weren't off on missions, of course). Of course, the lifestyle was highly dangerous, and even with their super human powers, Babel's paranormal field team experienced occasional casualties.&nbsp; <br /><br /><p>For instance, as the world began to fall apart in the wake of the White Event, Babel had decided that he wanted to recruit the so-called Psi-Force into the Web's ranks, and came up with a nifty plan with the U.S. Government in order to facilitate this. This plan failed in the end, however, when the Americans went back on their deal, and the mission cost the Web its super speedster, Relampago. </p><p>Persistent to the end, Babel continued working on the Psi-Force youths, and eventually gained their trust after freeing them from the Siberian Project a year later. Of course, this operation cost the team more lives, and Gatto di Sangue was another casualty of his recruiting attempts; naturally, this is because the team encountered the demonic Rodstvow while making good on their escape. </p><p>Psi-Force wasn't the Medusa Web's only concern, however. Between his first and second big recruiting drive, Babel had sent his team out on various shady missions. For instance, Potiphar was sent to recover a lost shipment of nerve gas from a band of Iranians and return them to their rightful owners. Later, he and several others were sent to acquire schematics for the Mark III M.A.X. armor. </p><p>Their most ambitious move, however, involved inserting Toocheetsch into the Soviet seat of power. After discovering that his parability involved the manipulation of his body mass, Babel had him disguised as a perfect body double for Mikhail Gorbachev, and then had him take over the U.S.S.R. by replacing the real deal. Of course, what the Web did with their newfound rule has yet to be seen. </p><p>That was because the War, the third world-wide conflict to occur on the earth, had broken out immediately after Toocheetsch had been put in power - much as Babel had predicted. Of course, the Web wasn't quite ready to make itself the world's primary target yet, so it simply did everything it could to keep the earth in one peace for the duration of the conflict. </p><p> The exact nature of these actions, as well as those after the War itself, have yet to be revealed... </p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The first time the sidekicks joined forces was when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a>, Kid Flash and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tempest/29-2382/\">Aqualad</a> joined together to stop the menace of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mister-twister/29-46998/\">Mr. Twister</a> in Hatton Corners.</p><p>Their second meeting was more eventful: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Robin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wally-west/29-23879/\">Kid Flash</a>, Aqualad, now joined by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Wonder Girl</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roy-harper/29-3404/\">Speedy</a>, fought against their mentors, who had been possessed by the evil <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-antithesis/29-48673/\">Antithesis</a>. At this second meeting, the five youngsters decided to become a team, and the Teen Titans were born. Robin naturally became the leader of the original Teen Titans.</p><p>The sidekicks would continue to operate with their mentors, as well as spending time with their peers in the Teen Titans. Speedy elected for part-time membership, and the remaining four became the core team.</p><p>During this time, the four established a headquarters called the Titans Lair, and responded to teenagers needing help.</p><p>Soon, responsibilities in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atlantis/34-41030/\">Atlantis</a> forced Aqualad to take leave from the team, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/speedy/29-5300/\">Speedy</a> stepped in as a full time member.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Teen Titans first appeared in the Brave and the Bold #54 (7/1964) and were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-haney/26-48514/\">Bob Haney</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bruno-premiani/26-38458/\">Bruno Premiani</a> in 1964. Wonder Girl joined the team in their second appearance in the Brave and the Bold #60 (7/1965). The Teen Titans would make a third appearance in Showcase vol 1 #59 (12/1965) before getting their own on-going title. The Teen Titans later added to their ranks when Speedy appeared in Teen Titans vol 1 #4 (8/1966).</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Mr. Jupiter Enters the Picture</h3><p>After they accidentally brought about the death of Dr. Arthur Swenson, the group gave up their costumed identities for a time. It was at the urging of financier <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loren-jupiter/29-46936/\">Loren Jupiter</a> that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-flash/29-9961/\">Kid Flash</a>, Speedy, Wonder Girl, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawk/29-3574/\">Hawk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dove/29-3573/\">Dove</a> joined his program of training teens to utilize their potentials; Also joining the program was the mysterious <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilith-clay/29-12525/\">Lilith</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vox/29-35124/\">Mal Duncan</a>.</p><p>Now rejoined by Robin, the Teen Titans continued their adventures. However the group later disbanded after helping an old man rid his estate of a demonic race of creatures.</p><h3>Titans Reunited</h3><p>The second version of the Teen Titans was formed after the young heroes defeated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-light/29-3583/\">Dr. Light</a>, who had summoned them all in an attempt to get revenge on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">JLA</a> by attacking their young sidekicks. All of the original Titan members eventually returned, plus new recruits such as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bumblebee/29-3576/\">Bumblebee</a> and the Herald [ <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vox/29-35124/\">Mal Duncan</a>]. After a while, the Titans realized that they had their own lives to lead, and the group disbanded.</p><h3>The New and Improved Titans</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"181522\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7940/181522-107626-teen-titans_super.jpg\" title=\"The New Teen Titans\"><img id=\"181522\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7940/181522-107626-teen-titans_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The New Teen Titans\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The New Teen Titans</div></div></div></div><p>Some time after the original team was disbanded, a woman named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/raven/29-3584/\">Raven</a> appeared, attempting to gather together a new group of Titans. She convinced Robin to start recruiting, and they recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Wonder Girl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast-boy/29-3586/\">Changeling</a>, and the cyborg <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyborg/29-2388/\">Vic Stone</a>. Kid Flash declined, trying to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a> instead. Raven, an empath, needed him on the team, and so she interfered with his emotions, made him feel that he loved her, to convince him to join. On their first case they met the final member of the team, the alien princess <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfire/29-2389/\">Starfire</a>.</p><p>They elected to keep the team going, making their headquarters in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York.</a></p><h3>Arsenal's Titans</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roy-harper/29-3404/\">Arsenal</a> stepped in to fill the leadership place Nightwing had left. Thanks to a deal made with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sarge-steel/29-9931/\">Sarge Steel</a> of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/checkmate/65-40521/\">Checkmate</a> the Titans ended up with essentially working for the government. Unhappy with the deal, nearly everyone from the previous team left.</p><p>This team was a disaster. While they succeeded against Raven and other threats, the internal dynamics tore the team apart.</p><h3>Atom's Titans</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1630817\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1630817-atoms_team_super.jpg\" title=\"Atom's Team\"><img id=\"1630817\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1630817-atoms_team_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Atom's Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Atom's Team</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hot-spot/29-13096/\">Isaiah Crockett</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/argent/29-3575/\">Toni Monetti</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/risk/29-13015/\">Cody Driscoll</a> manifested strange super-powers when they turned 16. The meta-human teens, along with the teenaged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atom/29-2352/\">Atom</a>, were all abducted by an alien race called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hsan-natall/65-57588/\">H'San Natall</a>. On the alien ship, they rescue another meta-human teenaged girl who was raised in a virtual-reality simulator program. The group of teenagers escaped the aliens and returned to earth.</p><p>During the adventure, the teens learned that they were half-alien, and their mothers were impregnated by the H'San Natall years ago. All born on June 21st, the kids were part of a sleeper agent program by the H'San Natall to defeat the super-powered beings already on Earth. The group stayed together, becoming the new generation of Teen Titans. Isaiah Crockett became Joto; Toni Monetti, Argent; Cody Driscoll took the nickname, Risk; And the alien girl adopted the name, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prysm/29-13016/\">Prysm</a>. Atom decided to remain on the team to learn how to readjust to his life as a teenager, since he was de-aged by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-hall/29-2030/\">Extant</a> during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zero-hour/39-40782/\">Zero Hour</a> Crisis.</p><p>Jupiter was later forced to gather together the original Titans \u2013 Nightwing, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tempest/29-2382/\">Tempest</a>, Flash and Arsenal \u2013 to combat the threat of his bitter, super-powered son Jarrod Jupiter, the illusion-casting Haze. New and old Titans joined forces to defeat Haze \u2013 but at a price; Joto seemingly lost his life and Arsenal felt responsible for his death. Arsenal remained with this new group of Titans for a time. During this battle, the mysterious <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilith-clay/29-12525/\">Omen</a> was revealed to be former Titans, Lilith.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/teen-titans/65-19081/\">Teen Titans</a> almost disbanded following these events, but Argent rallied the team to re-form. After a recruitment drive, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freddy-freeman/29-10935/\">Captain Marvel, Jr</a>. and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fringe/29-46408/\">Fringe</a> joined the team.</p><p>After a confrontation with Deathstroke, the teens were taken to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titan/34-41103/\">Titan</a>, the moon of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saturn/34-56294/\">Saturn</a>, where they confronted their H'San Natall creators and Prysm's mother. Joto was resurrected, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prysm/29-13016/\">Prysm</a> and Fringe decided to remain on Titan. Upon returning to earth, the Titans learned that Atom has been restored to his true age. The rest of the team decided to go their separate ways and disbanded.</p><h3>The Titans</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1630822\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1630822-titans_super.jpg\" title=\"The Titans\"><img id=\"1630822\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1630822-titans_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Titans\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Titans</div></div></div></div><p>Cyberion (Cyborg) journeyed to Earth to turn its moon into a new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/technis/29-12509/\">Technis</a> world and populate it with his Titans allies.

Epsilon was eventually revealed to be under possession by a D.E.O. orphan named Kevin. When the real psychotic Epsilon emerged, he cut a swath of destruction that resulted in the utter destruction of the Titans Tower. Eventually, Epsilon was defeated and the D.E.O. orphans were provided better care at the improved D.E.O. facility.</p><h3>From Young Justice to The Teen Titans</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1630827\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1630827-new_new_teen_titans_super.jpg\" title=\"The New Team\"><img id=\"1630827\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1630827-new_new_teen_titans_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The New Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The New Team</div></div></div></div><p>The Teen Titans are re-started by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyborg/29-2388/\">Cyborg</a> following the death of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilith-clay/29-12525/\">Omen</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfire/29-2389/\">Starfire</a>, Cyborg and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast-boy/29-3586/\">Beast Boy</a> decide formalize a mentor/training aspect for their new Teen Titans.

In the end, Ravager proves that she marches to the beat of her own drum as she attacks Bombshell to make sure that Amy has indeed returned to the team in order to better herself and atone for her mistakes. During this time period, Eddie's role as a team member is once again put into question since he continues to have no powers and Ravager offers to have Eddie accompany her on her travels, to which he declines.</p><p>Wonder Girl begins to slip back into her old ways as she feels bad about herself once more. The Teen Titans do battle with the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fearsome-five/65-45188/\">Fearsome Five</a> during this period. Additionally, Eddie's role as a team member is finally revealed as he acts as a field coordinator for the team. Unfortunately for Eddie, and the team, he sacrifices himself to save the city and with his death, the team suffers another crushing loss. However, Red Devil's death solidifies the team as they proclaim they will persevere. Also during this battle, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-eternity/29-9363/\">Kid Eternity</a> was kidnapped by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/calculator/29-2545/\">Calculator</a> and is being forced to constantly bring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvin-white/29-43726/\">Marvin</a> back from the dead to talk to his dad. But due to Eternity's low popularity with the other members of his team, they all assume that he just decided to quit and left. Kid Eternity is revealed to have died while captured, unknown to any of the Teen Titans.</p><p>As the New York-based Titans dissolve, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast-boy/29-3586/\">Beast Boy</a> returns to the team in order to help them find their way once more. Beast Boy's assertion that he is the new team leader rubs some of the members the wrong way and it is established that Wonder Girl is still indeed the team leader. The reunion is cut short when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/raven/29-3584/\">Raven</a> is discovered outside the tower unconscious. The team does battle with the mysterious entity known only as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wyld/29-67084/\">Wyld</a> but defeats it after banding together.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1632412\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1632412-teen_titans_in_dakota_super.jpg\" title=\"The Teen Titans head to Dakota\"><img id=\"1632412\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1632412-teen_titans_in_dakota_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Teen Titans head to Dakota\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Teen Titans head to Dakota</div></div></div></div><p>Soon after, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/static/29-26578/\">Static</a> decides to return to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dakota/34-56179/\">Dakota</a> for the first time since he was captured by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-side-club/34-55480/\">Dark Side Club</a> due to a plague that has hit the city. The team does battle with Holocaust and are having a rough time, leading to some of the team being captured. The remaining members of the team begin hunting for their lost teammates, while <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyborg/29-2388/\">Cyborg</a> addresses Beast Boy's call for help and arrives with resurrected ex-Titans <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Kid Flash</a>. The reinforcements arrive just in time and the combined might of the Teen Titans and their friends allow them to narrowly defeat Holocaust. As the battle wraps up the team takes one of Holocaust's allies with them for questioning.</p><p>Surprisingly, the unnamed captive destroys the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/t-wing/18-56170/\">T-wing</a> and captures Raven, taking her into a dimensional rift. The Titans soon surmise that their recent mystical enemy the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wyld/29-67084/\">Wyld</a> is behind this kidnapping and the team returns to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titans-tower/34-55705/\">Titans Tower</a> to regroup and find Raven's location. With the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-ewald-barnes/29-38795/\">Dr. Ewald Barnes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-rochelle-barnes/29-74607/\">Dr. Rochelle Barnes</a>, married <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cadmus-labs/34-55682/\">Cadmus</a> scientists, the team discovers a way to get to Raven that requires them to split into teams. Cassie sends Aquagirl and Bombshell to the depths of the Atlantic ocean and leads the remainder of the team with her to find Raven. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle/29-4438/\">Blue Beetle</a> and Miss Martian are noticeably absent from this mission as Beetle is caught up in the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-generation-lost/49-33082/\">Justice League: Generation Lost</a> and M'Gann is experiencing power fluctuations after her run-in with the Wyld. Back at Titan's Tower, the Cadmus scientists continue monitoring the situation while Miss Martian suddenly awakens and claims that she needs to help the team return from Wyld's world before its too late. After using an experimental helmet to help the Titans, M'Gann is briefly overtaken by Wyld and kills one of the Cadmus scientists, only to be put down by the female Dr. Barnes who is revealed to have superpowers of her own. In the final battle with Wyld, Static is drained of his powers and demoralized. When Wonder Girl and her squad of Titans return to Titan's Tower, they find <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyborg/29-2388/\">Cyborg</a> already there with an unconscious Miss Martian. The Titans also soon find out that Aquagirl and Bombshell are lost in the depths of the ocean. With this, Static, Miss Martian, the Cadmus Scientist, and Cyborg all leave the Tower in order to cure both Static and Miss Martian.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1462838\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67078/1462838-ttitans_91_02_super.jpg\" title=\"A Familiar Line-up\"><img id=\"1462838\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67078/1462838-ttitans_91_02_medium.jpg\" alt=\"A Familiar Line-up\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A Familiar Line-up</div></div></div></div><p>Following the run-in with the mystical <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wyld/29-67084/\">Wyld</a>, the Teen Titans have lost a few members. Lorena and Amy are soon found but placed on the reserve list due to Cassie's decision to only led heroes she feels are fit for membership. This prompts Wonder Girl is invite <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ravager/29-12890/\">Ravager</a> to return to the team, which Rose surprisingly accepts. Returning to a similar lineup that the team had during it's inception, Wonder Girl and the Teen Titans head out on patrol and put down a riot of teenagers acting strangely. Dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/feral-boys/65-57731/\">Feral Boys</a>, the team begins to delve into their existence but are interrupted by an intruder at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titans-tower/34-55705/\">Titan's Tower</a>. The intruder is in fact the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Batman</a> (Dick Grayson) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/damian-wayne/29-42413/\">Robin</a> (Damian Wayne). Robin insists that he has come to lead the Teen Titans in the absence of the previous <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tim-drake/29-9290/\">Robin</a> (Tim Drake). The new status quo begins to be explored as the creator of the Feral Boys, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-caligan/29-74587/\">Dr. Caligan</a>, continues his experiments on local teenagers. Caligan has shown to have a few metahuman creations of his own such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/headcase/29-72857/\">Headcase</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doll-face/29-75694/\">Doll Face</a>. The Titans band together to defeat Caligan and his experiments but he narrowly escapes.</p><p>The Titans are called in by former member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tim-drake/29-9290/\">Tim Drake</a>, who is now operating under the Red Robin moniker. The reunion centers around Red Robin's recent case involved the unternet and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/calculator/29-2545/\">Calculator</a>. While doing battle with the Calculator's androids, he reveals to Wonder Girl that he kidnapped and killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-eternity/29-9363/\">Kid Eternity</a>. Angry, Cassie attempts to kill him but is stopped by her teammates and she comes to her senses. The androids are defeated and the team realizes that Calculator was never even truly there, only robots. Following the battle, Robin decides to leave the team, claiming they were holding him back. This leads the Titans to assume that Tim is coming back to the team, to which he does following this mission.</p><p>Red Robin once again takes the reigns of the team as Wonder Girl passes them off to him, claiming to need time to focus on herself. The team responds to a missing persons report to help Cassie's mother and the heroine <a href=\"/solstice/29-74586/\">Solstice</a>. Wonder Girl and her archeologist mother are soon after captured by Indian demons and whisked away.</p><h2>The New 52</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2165843\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/101137/2165843-tt_cv8_mn896789as8d7f6.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2165843\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/101137/2165843-tt_cv8_mn896789as8d7f6_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>After the major DC Reboot, all of the history between <a href=\"/tim-drake/29-9290/\">Tim Drake</a>, <a href=\"/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a>, <a href=\"/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Bart Allen</a> and <a href=\"/wonder-girl/29-10885/\">Cassandra Sandsmark</a> has been erased. They have never met and thus Young Justice and the latest version of the Teen Titans has never been formed. In the DC Revamp, Red Robin (still the alias for Tim Drake) has gained knowledge on an interesting organization called N.O.W.H.E.R.E that tries to capture or kill teenaged metahumans for the purpose of containing them so they don't prove harmful to humanity.

The Titans, spared the fate of Earth as they were in the remains of Azerath, returned to face their own inner demons (literally) at the hands of Raven, but they were able to force Trigon back as a long awaited moment arrived, when the spirit of Azar revealed her true intentions for Raven. At the last moment, Trigon was caught by the purified souls of Azerath working through Raven's powers, and annihilated him and restoring the world before they and Raven vanished.</p><p>Then <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfire/29-2389/\">Starfire</a> was called back to her homeworld <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tamaran/34-56012/\">Tamaran</a> for an arranged marriage, and the team fell apart.

Collecting these youths together as the Teen Titans, named in honour of the original super-hero group of the 20th century, he created a nearly invisible army of underground freedom fighters. But he knew Lord Chaos's power, and he knew if Chaos had captured any one of his warriors, they could be forced to reveal his location and the whereabouts of the entire Teen Titans army. To prevent this, he created smaller subgroups of Titans. Each small platoon force was given specific missions, but knew nothing of their leader or the whereabouts of the other Titan-platoons. This would assure each group's safety, as well as the safety and existence of the entire underground.</p><p>A man named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/battalion/29-46853/\">Lyons</a> (whose family was slain by Lord Chaos) vowed revenge on Chaos and joined the rebellion. Lyons, now dubbed Battalion, became the \u2018drill sergeant from hell' to the Team Titans. He worked with the future-Nightwing in training these young warriors.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-titans/65-50386/\"><b>The Titans</b></a></h3><p>Founding and prominent members of the first and second group of Teen Titans united.</p><h3>Travel to the Past</h3><p>Shortly thereafter, the Team Titans leader gave the team a mission: travel 10 years into the past to stop Chaos from ever being born. To accomplish this, the Teamers were assigned to kill Donna Troy before she would give birth to the child who would become Lord Chaos! The Teamers successfully traveled to the past and came into conflict with the Titans. Donna gave birth to her son before the Teamers could intervene. However, the Titans and the Team Titans were able to stop Chaos and spare Donna's life at the same time. After this, the Teamers found themselves stranded in the past, unable to return to their future. With nowhere else to go, they resided at Donna Troy's New Jersey farmhouse. The Teamers tried to find a place in this new world. Also joining them was Battalion, who had traveled to the past as well. Shortly after that, the future version of Nightwing entered this timeline. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mirage/29-3587/\">Mirage</a> was reunited with her lover only briefly. A dark version of Raven attacked the future Nightwing and corrupted him by planting a Trigon-seed within him. Nightwing now renamed himself Deathwing, and became violent and brutal. Deathwing visited Mirage, where he attacked and raped her. Mirage then learned she was pregnant with Deathwing's child. The Team Titans encountered new threats from present day as well as their own future timeline. Some Team Titans were allies (the female rock group Metallik) while others were adversaries (Judge and Jury). The Teamers also encountered the power-mad Titan, Lazarium, whose schemes led the Teamers to encounter dozens of time-tossed Team Titans.</p><p>Soon, the Teamers lives were disrupted by the time crisis known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zero-hour/39-40782/\">Zero Hour</a>. It was then revealed that the Team Titans leader in the future was the villainous <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/monarch/29-12940/\">Monarch</a> - who created a false future world so he could train meta-humans (The Team Titans) to act as sleeper agent assassins. He knew of the impending time crisis, and wanted a super-powered army at his command. The time-villain Extant commanded all the Team Titans to attack the heroes who were trying to unravel this time crisis. His plan was thwarted; the heroes contained the Teamers. Time continued to collapse, erasing the false time lines that had emerged. As a result, all the Team Titans were erased from existence.</p><p>Strangely enough, three people remained unscathed from Monarch's false timeline: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terra/29-5307/\">Tara Markov</a> (Terra II, Mirage and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathwing/29-63563/\">Deathwing</a>. Terra and Mirage remained members of a new Titans team, led by Arsenal. Shortly after the team was reformed, a strange orb appeared, with messages for Mirage and Terra.</p><p>The orb was sent by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/time-trapper/29-25998/\">Time Trapper</a>. The Time Trapper revealed that Mirage, Deathwing and Terra were from this timeline, not an alternate timeline, as they had thought. All three had been implanted with false memories by the Time Trapper and turned into \"sleeper agents\" who would fight the villainous Monarch in the coming Zero Hour event.</p><h3><a href=\"/titans-of-tomorrow/65-57249/\">Titans of Tomorrow</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"493418\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/493418-titanstomorrow_super.jpg\" title=\"The Titans of tomorrow\"><img id=\"493418\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/493418-titanstomorrow_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Titans of tomorrow\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Titans of tomorrow</div></div></div></div><p>Years in the past, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titans-of-tomorrow/65-57249/\">Titans of Tomorrow</a> disbanded when they saw their own dark future. But rather than preventing the events, this insured they would come to pass. When a great crisis came, it claimed the lives of many of the adult heroes and the disbanded Titans weren't there to save them. Shattered by these events, the Titans of Tomorrow lost their optimism to a more cynical world view. In their time apart, they were also influenced by outside forces \u2013 such as Ares and Lex Luthor. As the former teen sidekicks grew into adulthood, they assumed their mentor's personas - or adopted new identities of their own.</p><p>In an effort to prevent future tragedies, the Titans of Tomorrow - Batman [Tim Drake], Superman [Conner Kent], Wonder Woman [Cassie Sandsmark], Animal Man [Gar Logan], Aquawoman [Lorena Marquez], the Flash [Bart Allen] and Dark Raven - gathered together 6 years after they disbanded to create a police state \u2013 one free of crime, poverty and disease. For the most part, they actually succeeded. But the people gave up their freedom for it. There were rebellions along the West Coast that Raven stopped \u2013 by siphoning the free will of the rebels. Cyborg 2.0 and Bumblebee gathered together their own Titans and managed to free twelve of the fifty states.</p><p>When the present Teen Titans returned from the trip with the Legion, they arrived ten years too late! In the future, they met a different Titans lineup: Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Animal Man, Aquawoman, the Flash and Dark Raven... The Titans of Tomorrow! Face to face with themselves ten years from now, the Teen Titans began to realize that all was not as it seemed. Before the Titans of Tomorrow could find a way to send the Teen Titans back to their proper time, Superboy made a shocking discovery: He found the future Titans torturing Deathstroke for information. A confrontation led to a a battle between present and future Titans teams!</p><p>Seeking to preserve his future, Batman captured Robin in hopes of erasing his memories of the future he had witnessed. Meanwhile, the other Titans located the future Cyborg; Now known as Cyborg 2.0, he rallied together Titans East as a resistance force to oppose the tyrannical Titans. Titans East included Bumblebee, Batwoman (<a href=\"/flamebird/29-3577/\">Bette Kane</a>), Captain Marvel( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freddy-freeman/29-10935/\">Freddy Freeman</a>),Terra, Ravager and secret-member Flash.</p><p>Teen Titans and Titans East sought the cosmic treadmill, which would be able to return them to their proper time. Finally locating the treadmill at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a>, three Titans teams engaged in a major skirmish... But amid the chaos, Flash and Kid Flash were able to jump start the cosmic treadmill and return home to their proper time.</p><p>Now armed with knowledge of the future, the Titans must stay together to steer clear of a possible dark destiny.</p><h3>Future Roster</h3><ul><li>Superman (Superboy)</li><li>Batman (Robin)</li><li>Wonder Woman (Wonder Girl)</li><li>Flash (Bart Allen)</li><li>Animal Man (Beast Boy)</li><li>Dark Raven (Raven)</li><li>Aquawoman (Aquagirl)</li></ul><h3>New Roster during Titans Tomorrow . . .

        "description":"<p>The Marvel Family consisted of six individuals who had been granted special powers by the ancient wizard <a href=\"/shazam/29-2365/\">Shazam</a>, and one fake. Shazam wielded his powers for 3000 years, before the rise of historic civilizations. Later, in <a href=\"/egypt/34-55877/\">Egypt</a> he tried to give the powers to <a href=\"/black-adam/29-4916/\">Teth Adam</a>, known now as Black Adam, but this hero turned villain. Shazam decided to wait a while and, when his own death was imminent, to pass his powers on to children who were pure in heart.</p><p>So, when his time came, Shazam had a mysterious figure bring newsboy <a href=\"/billy-batson/29-2350/\">Billy Batson</a> to him, and gave the lad mystic powers, which Billy gained by saying the wizard's name and changing into Captain Marvel, the World's Mightiest Mortal.</p><p>The next additions to the Marvel Family came when Billy, who was now working as a newscaster at station WHIZ, met 3 boys who shared his name; tall Billy Batson from <a href=\"/texas/34-55822/\">Texas</a>, Fat Billy Batson from Brooklyn and Hill Billy Batson from Nashville. These nicknames were chosen to differentiate them from the famous Billy.</p><p>Billy shared with the other boys his secret - that he was Captain Marvel. Even so, they were reluctant to speak the <a href=\"/magic/12-55759/\">magic</a> word, \"Shazam.\"</p><p>Then <a href=\"/dr-sivana/29-6263/\">Sivana</a> entered the picture, with 3 evil associates; bandit \"Biggy\" Brix, Nazi agent Herr-Geyer, and the strange Captain Death. Each of these was sent by Sivana to capture Billy Batson - but they each captured one of his namesake's. The evil scientist sent a message to Billy to come in that identity or his friends would die.</p><p>Billy knew he was walking into a trap, but he took the chance - and the four boys ended up tied to a log in a sawmill, bound and gagged. Billy managed to get his gag off by holding his head just close enough to the saw. But the machinery was so loud, it drowned out his shouts. The other 3 Billies added their voices and the word was audible. All 4 became \"Captain Marvels.\" But the others agreed there was only one Captain Marvel, so they became his 2nd Lieutenants - the Three Lieutenant Marvels.</p><p>After defeating the villains, the 3 other Billies agreed to speak the magic word only in concert with the first Billy. They first broke this agreement when Billy was framed for treason and they went to his assistance as the Lieutenant Marvels.</p><p>The next members of the family were <a href=\"/freddy-freeman/29-10935/\">Captain Marvel junior</a>, <a href=\"/mary-marvel/29-2356/\">Mary Marvel</a> and <a href=\"/uncle-marvel/29-30886/\">Uncle Marvel</a>. Mary Batson kept a diary of her work as Mary Marvel - her Good Deed ledger, as she called it. One day she lost it and it was found by a man named Dudley, who read it and thus learned the secrets of Mary, Billy and the rest of the Marvel Family. He then introduced himself to Mary as her long-lost Uncle Dudley from <a href=\"/california/34-55716/\">California</a>. (\"Everyone has an unknown uncle from California\" he said). Moreover, when they both said, \"Shazam\" Dudley also changed - to uncle Marvel. (Although he simply shed his outer clothes to reveal a prepared costume beneath).</p><p>Dudley then set up a business, Shazam incorporated, with himself as president, explaining he would donate all proceeds of the Marvels' good work to needy causes and would make his enterprise a non-profit organisation. Mary soon realised that he was a fraud when he said, \"Shazam!\" without changing. But, being a good hearted soul, she let him continue with his pretense and the other Marvel Family members did the same.</p><p>Uncle Marvel often cried off when he was supposed to fly by claiming he had \"Shazam-bago.\" Once he used an invention of his - a collapsible rocket motor - to fly, but it didn't work properly and it was soon abandoned. It seems Dudley is his last name, as he has a real niece named Mary Dudley (called Freckles). Although she sometimes wore a Mary Marvel costume and called herself Freckles Marvel, she never pretended to have Shazam powers an dis not regarded as a true member of the Marvel Family.</p><p>Another who has the Shazam powers is <a href=\"/hoppy-the-marvel-bunny/29-33378/\">Hoppy the Marvel Bunny</a> or Captain Marvel Bunny. He lives in a world of furry animals and is consequently not really part of the actual Marvel family. Though <a href=\"/kid-eternity/29-9363/\">Kid Eternity</a> is Captain Marvel Junior's brother, and as such he is a member of his natural family, he's not in fact a member of the super-power sharing Marvel Family.</p><p>At one time, the Marvel Family had a show on WHIZ-TV, and for several years they continued to fight all sorts of evil, until one day Sivana and his family struck at a ceremony honouring the Marvels. The heroes and their friends wound up in a globe of Suspendium for decades - an act which backfired on the Sivana's, for they too were trapped. Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr. and Mary Marvel (and presumably everyone else) were freed by the events of the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>. All 3 continue to play major roles in the DCU - especially in the various crises that particular Universe/<a href=\"/the-dc-multiverse/12-43603/\">Multiverse</a> is now facing.</p>",

One aspect that has always remained constant were three heroic teenagers saving the life of a man who would be their benefactor.</p><p>In the 30th century, the galaxy is a crowded place. There are thousands of inhabited worlds and intelligent species, and very few of them get along with each other. Still, there are those who believe that a united galaxy is the best solution for everybody. One of those is <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>, one of the richest men in the galaxy. He pushed for a United Planets organization to handle conflicts between systems, and while he had some support, he also had a lot of resistance. There were some who opposed him so strongly that they wished him dead.</p><p>One of these assassination attempts was in the presence of three teenagers, strangers to each other. <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Imra Ardeen</a> from Titan, with her people's power of telepathy, <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rokk Krinn</a> from Braal, one of the best manipulators of magnetic fields on his planet, and <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garth Ranzz</a> from Winath, who had gained his powers over electricity in a bizarre accident on another world.</p><p>The three youths worked together instantly, foiling the assassination and capturing the suspects. Brande saw in them the embodiment of all he had been working towards, and convinced them to follow in the footsteps of the great heroes of the 20th century. They wore costumes and used code names and became the Legion of Super-Heroes. Imra Ardeen was <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>, Garth Ranzz was <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad</a> and Rokk Krinn was <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"../../otto-binder/26-42374/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Otto Binder</a> and <a href=\"../../al-plastino/26-39933/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Al Plastino</a> created the Legion of Super-Heroes as well as creating the three founding members for the team. Binder wrote the story and Plastino drew the art for Adventure Comics vol 1 #247 in 1958. Like many of Superboy's stories in Adventure Comics, this issue was meant to be a one-shot story and the Legion's only appearance. This issue was so popular that DC published a second Legion story in Adventure Comics vol 1 #267 in 1959 which was also a success with fans. The Legion of Super-Heroes eventually became a regular feature in Action Comics, Adventure Comics and Superboy which led to the Legion being published in their own book.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age (1960s)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1530090\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10812/1530090-adventure_comics_12.jpg\" title=\"Silver Age\"><img id=\"1530090\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10812/1530090-adventure_comics_12_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Silver Age\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Silver Age</div></div></div></div><p>News of the Legion spread quickly, and soon there were many superpowered youngsters clamoring to join. Some had powers native to their homeworlds, others had acquired them through strange accidents. The number of people who wanted to join eventually grew so large that the Legion had to hold regular tryouts, in which any potential Legionnaire could show his or her abilities.</p><p>The Legion was heavily involved with time travel, often going back to the 20th century to meet their idol, <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy</a> - the original teen hero (<i>See</i> <i>Adventure Comics</i> vol 1 #247). Superboy would go to the 30th Century as a regular member of the Legion roster. The Legion also accepted Superboy's cousin, <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>, as a member of the team although she came from a later time period in the 20th century. The Legion battled alien conquerors, evil robots, crazed magicians and even demigods (<em>See</em> <em>Adventure Comics vol 1</em>, <em><a href=\"../../action-comics/49-18005/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Action Comics</i></a></em>, <em><a href=\"../../superboy/49-19154/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Superboy</i></a> vol 1</em> and <i>Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes</i> vol 1).</p><h3>Bronze Age (1970s-1980s)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"520417\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/520417-legion_of_super_heroes__color_by_dalgoda7.jpg\" title=\"Bronze Age\"><img id=\"520417\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/520417-legion_of_super_heroes__color_by_dalgoda7_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Bronze Age\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Bronze Age</div></div></div></div><p>During this time new legionnaires joined <a href=\"/dawnstar/29-3622/\">Dawnstar</a> and <a href=\"/wildfire/29-3621/\">Wildfire</a>.

Magnetic Kid, Polar Boy, Quislet, and Tellus (Ganglios of Hykraius). Comet Queen, Mentalla (Deyla Castill of Titan), and Power Boy (Jed Rikane) are rejected. Saturn Girl asks to admit the masked Sensor Girl (Projectra). Dev-Em declines an offer of membership. Eventually, Superboy limited his visits to the 30th Century and changed his active membership to a reservist status. The Legion continued to battle any threats or dangers that plagued the universe. Members grew up, married and had children, and members died in battle (<i>See</i> <i>Legion of Super-Heroes</i> <i>vol 1</i> and <a href=\"../49-3033/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> <i>vol 2</i>). Although Superboy grew up to be <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superman</a> and no longer an active Legionnaire, Superman and the Legion continued to associate with each other (<i>See</i> <i>DC Comics Presents</i> <i>#13</i>, #<i>43</i>, #<i>59</i>, #<i>80</i> and <a href=\"../../worlds-finest-comics/49-18006/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>World's Finest Comics</i></a> <i>vol 1</i> <i>#283</i>, #<i>284</i>).</p><p>Then a Crisis of cosmic proportions threatened the entire universe in the past, present and future. The <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i> threatened all life in every timeline. The Legion gathered with many heroes of different eras to fight the entity known as the <a href=\"../../anti-monitor/29-12165/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Monitor</a> who caused this catastrophe. Many heroes died in battle to ensure the defeat of the Anti-Monitor including a member of the Legion, Supergirl. After the Anti-Monitor was defeated and the Crisis averted, all the heroes returned to their own eras. The Legion continued to safeguard the universe and battle any threat against them as usual.</p><h3>Five Years Later / Glorithverse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1980574\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/1980574-who_s_who__90_09_14a.jpg\" title=\"Five Years Later\"><img id=\"1980574\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/1980574-who_s_who__90_09_14a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Five Years Later\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Five Years Later</div></div></div></div><p>Sometime after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, the Legion disbanded but it was reassembled five years later by <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon Boy</a>, who saw a need for the Legion in this darker era (See <em><i>Legion Super-Heroes</i> vol 3 #1</em>). By this time, the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>, a super-scientific race, had control of the Earth and, by extension, the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets</a>. The new Legion did away with much of its child-like past - no more bright costumes or cute code names. Their main purpose was to free Earth from the Dominators. In the process, they would learn much about themselves as well.</p><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6 (Legionnaire)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"742956\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7658/742956-legionairres.jpg\" title=\"Legionnaire (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"742956\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7658/742956-legionairres_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Legionnaire (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Legionnaire (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>The most startling discovery they made was a group of <a href=\"/legionnaires/65-56923/\">Legionnaire</a> clones, labeled batch SW6, that the Dominators had grown and kept hidden on Earth. These clones were all teenagers, reminiscent of the Legion's early days, and believed that they were in fact the original Legion. They believed the older Legion was fake, an impossible distortion of their dream. After the destruction of the Earth, the older Legion team went into hiding, and worked in secret.</p><p>The end of the Legion came with the event known as <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>. The temporal instability of Zero Hour led to a massive battle between Glorith, <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> and the Time Trapper against the combined Legions. The Time Trapper, who was actually Rokk Krinn after an eternity stuck in the Library of Time, revealed that the clones weren't clones at all - they were versions of the Legion from an alternate timeline, and if the Legion wanted any hope of surviving the coming crisis, the doppelgangers would have to cancel each other out. The last legionnaires were also the first - Lightning Lad, Cosmic Boy and Saturn Girl, and their counterparts. They merged with each other and their universe ended.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"81265\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81265-163814-legion-of-super-hero.jpg\" title=\"Earth-247\"><img id=\"81265\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81265-163814-legion-of-super-hero_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-247\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-247</div></div></div></div><p>The \"rebooted\" Legion began much as the original had - Ranzz, Ardeen and Krinn foiling an attempt on the life of R.J. Brande and becoming the Legion, living symbols of the new United Planets. This group also grew rapidly, accepting many members and eventually having to hold tryouts for new ones. There were some significant differences, however. Some of the names were different - Live Wire instead of Lightning Lad, Apparition instead of Phantom Girl and so on. Some characters, such as <a href=\"../../bouncing-boy/29-21506/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chuck Taine</a> (Bouncing Boy) and <a href=\"../../matter-eater-lad/29-3598/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tenzil Kem</a> (Matter-Eater Lad) filled non-heroic roles as the Legion's chief technologist and gourmet cook, respectively.</p><p>A few heroes joined who had no counterparts in the previous Legion - <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XS</a>, the granddaughter of <a href=\"../../barry-allen/29-22804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Barry Allen</a> (Flash II), <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates</a>, an insectoid teleporter with communist leanings, and Kid Quantum, who could alter the very flow of time itself. As before, it wasn't long until members died. The first <a href=\"../../kid-quantum/29-1520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kid Quantum</a> died when his power-belt malfunctioned, depriving him of his powers and giving Tangleweb a chance to snap his neck. <a href=\"../../leviathan/29-1521/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviathan</a> (previously Colossal Boy) died fighting Doctor Regulus. Other members who had died in the previous incarnation of the Legion went on to survive. <a href=\"../../invisible-kid/29-1256/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invisible Kid</a> and <a href=\"../../ferro-lad/29-22592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ferro</a> are the two most notable of these. This Legion acted as police, ambassadors and explorers, working to bring peace and understanding to the galaxy. They had many adventures, including an extended period when half the Legion was stranded in the 20th Century, following a battle with one of their own - <a href=\"../../shrinking-violet/29-12835/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrinking Violet</a>, who was in the thrall of the <a href=\"../../emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerald Eye of Ekron</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296669\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296669-124883-legion-of-super-hero.jpg\" title=\"Earth-Prime\"><img id=\"296669\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296669-124883-legion-of-super-hero_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-Prime\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-Prime</div></div></div></div><p>While the exact origin of the Legion is still unknown, the world they live in is very different. It is a time of stagnation and conformity, where physical contact with other people is considered the height of rudeness, and even people in the same room will use electronic means to converse rather than talk to each other. Children are bio-tagged so their parents can track them anywhere, and are taught obedience and propriety.</p><p>In this environment, the Legion has become an icon of youthful rebellion. While the actual working membership of the Legion is only about twenty, the thousands of young people who have left their homes and gathered together in its support are also considered Legionnaires. The \"core team\" have adopted code names conforming to the pattern of 20th century heroes - one-word noun or adjective, followed by \"Boy,\" \"Girl,\" \"Lad,\" or \"Lass.\"</p><p>For a long time, the <a href=\"../../science-police/65-23409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science Police</a>, the dominant power on Earth, considered the Legion a threat, but now is attempting to put the Legion under its power. As with the previous \"reboot,\" there are some changes to characters. For example, Colossal Boy is now from a race of giants. His ability to shrink to six feet tall is why he wants to be called \"Micro Lad,\" but his teammates prefer his original name. <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon Boy</a>, who in previous incarnations was recognizably male, is an androgynous character due to his nature as a shapeshifter, and thereby only goes by the codename \"Chameleon.\" Phantom Girl gains her abilities by phasing from one dimension to another, to the extent that she is existing in two worlds at once.</p><p>The current Legion exists to fight not only evil but also conformity, fear and oppression. They are at the front lines of the generation gap in the galaxy. Their first battle cry, coined by Lightning Lad, was \"Eat it, Grandpa,\" which says a great deal about the view the current team has of the world.</p><h3>Retroboot / New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1476368\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/61810/1476368-picture_1.png\" title=\"New Earth\"><img id=\"1476368\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/61810/1476368-picture_1_medium.png\" alt=\"New Earth\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">New Earth</div></div></div></div><p>This incarnation of the Legion shares the same history as the Modern Age Legion up to the events of <i>Crisis on Infinite Earths</i>.

Earth-Man uses the claim to have Earth secede from the United Planets and ban all aliens from Earth, resulting in several Legionnaires going underground. With the help of Superman, the Legion eventually restores the Sun to its normal state and defeats Earth-Man and the Justice League of Earth just as the United Planets is about to attack the Earth (See <a href=\"/superman-and-the-legion-of-super-heroes/49-36210/\">Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes</a>).</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / Legion Lost</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1999891\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/66037/1999891-legion_lost_new_52_1_cover.jpeg\" title=\"Post-Flashpoint\"><img id=\"1999891\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/66037/1999891-legion_lost_new_52_1_cover_medium.jpeg\" alt=\"Post-Flashpoint\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Post-Flashpoint</div></div></div></div><p>Wildfire, Dawnstar, Timber Wolf, Tyroc, Tellus, Gates, and Chameleon Girl stranded in the 21st Century on a mission to save the future; however, they must remain there after they fear they have contracted a pathogen that could destroy the 31st century if they return.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Modern Age</h3><h4>Time Trapper Manipulating Time</h4><p>The Legion discovered anomalies in history that did not coincide with their version of history including historical data about Superman. The <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> seemed to be responsible for manipulating the time stream (<em>See</em> <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/49-3597/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Cosmic Boy</i></a> <em>mini series</em> and <a href=\"../../legends/39-40775/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Legends</em></a>). The Legion decided to travel in the <a href=\"../../time-bubble/18-47355/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Bubble</a> to confront the Time Trapper at his citadel at the end of time. The Time Trapper diverted the Legion to Superboy's time period where some members of the Legion were captured by Superboy (<em>See</em> <em><a href=\"../49-3033/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Legion Of Super-Heroes</i></a> vol 2 #37</em>). The others escaped in the Time Bubble several years into the future and landed in Superman's time period. The Legion and Superman met for the first time which confused members of the Legion except for <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a>. Superboy was able to follow the Legion and captured them as well (<em>See</em> <a href=\"../../the-man-of-steel/49-3611/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Man of Steel</em></a> <em>mini series</em> and <em><a href=\"../../superman/49-28822/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Superman</i></a> vol 2 <i>#8</i></em>).</p><h4>Pocket Dimension</h4><p>Superboy brought them back to the past with Superman following him. Superboy and Superman battled in <a href=\"../../smallville/34-55733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Smallville</a> after arriving in the past. Superboy does not wish to fight anymore and explained his actions. Superman was returned to his own time period while Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes left to battle the Time Trapper (<em>See</em> <em><i>Action Comics #591</i></em>). The Time Trapper revealed that he altered the timeline to create a pocket dimension that contained the Superboy of an alternate Earth. Apparently, the Time Trapper diverted any travel by the Legion to Superman's early years to the Earth in this pocket dimension. Thus, the Legion invited the Superboy from this pocket dimension to be a Legionnaire. The Time Trapper created Superboy as part of a trap to destroy the Legion.</p><p>The Time Trapper coerced Superboy's cooperation by saving his home and family from a destructive storm of energy that could still be released to destroy them. Superboy died to save his Earth and to return the Legion safely to their own time period. Time travel was also stopped until Brainiac 5 finds another way through time (<em>See <i>Legion of Super-Heroes vol 2 #38</i></em>).</p><h4>The Magic Wars</h4><p>The Legion came together during a galaxy-wide cataclysm involving a struggle between the forces of magic and science. The Legion battled and defeated the <a href=\"../../archmage/29-54280/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Archmage</a> who was the source of the magical upheaval (<em>See <i>Legion of Super-Heroes vol 2 #60-#63</i></em>).</p><h3>Earth-247</h3><h4>The Blight</h4><p>The Legion continued to operate on Earth until the appearance of the <a href=\"../../blight/29-51354/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blight</a>, a star-spanning race of aliens who were determined to assimilate all life into their galactic web. They were defeated by the Legion, but at great cost, and the Earth was nearly in ruins. The Blight had used the UP's network of stargates to spread through the galaxy, and so the network was shut down until it could be made safer. The galaxy was about to enter a dark age, and the Legion was about to enter one of its own.</p><h4>Legion Lost</h4><p>While trying to contain a space-time rift caused by a malfunctioning stargate, half the Legion was flung out of our universe entirely into another, stranger place. They spent a year trying to get home, in the process discovering that their survival was due to the efforts of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>, who paid for their lives with his sanity. He became a kind of mad god of this universe, creating and extinguishing life at his whim. With the help of a native of that universe, Shikari Lonestar, and the sacrifice of one of the founders, Live Wire, the lost Legionnaires were able to make their way home, a year after they had left.</p><h4>The Returned of Lost Legionnaires</h4><p>During that year, the Legion had ceased to exist. Leland Macauley, a longtime opponent of the Legion, had become President of the United Planets, and the era of super-heroics was at its nadir. When the lost Legionnaires returned, however, they discovered that Macauley was actually <a href=\"../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's al Ghul</a>, who was preparing to bring the Earth to a state of near catastrophe so as to jump-start human evolution. He was thwarted, but at great cost.</p><h4>Legion Corps</h4><p>The Legion, now with complete autonomy thanks to R.J. Brande, looked forward to expanding its role in the galaxy. They had their own satellite, and were training a \"Legion Corps\" to assist them. They went into battle against great enemies, such as <a href=\"../../universo/29-22717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Universo</a> and <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a>.</p><h4>Fatal Five <b>Hundred</b></h4><p>When an attack by the <a href=\"../../fatal-five/65-42802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fatal Five</a> brought the Legion together with the <a href=\"../../teen-titans/65-19081/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Teen Titans</a>, another spacetime rift was created. In order to shut the rift, the Legion took the Persuader's axe - the cause of the rift - through it, and vanished. The member remaining in the standard DC continuity was <a href=\"../../shikari/29-5941/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shikari</a>, who immediately set out to find her friends. She did so during the <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>, on Earth-247.</p><h3>New Earth</h3><h4>Legion of 3 Worlds</h4><p>Superman is pull from the past to help the under men Legion against <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> the <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-villains/65-47190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Super-Villains</a>. Even with Superman they are still out match against LSV, so Brainiac 5 calls on two other incarnation Legion from other realties to fight Superboy-Prime, the Legion of Super-Villains, and the Time Trapper. It was revealed in the mini-series that the \"Reboot\" Legion came from Earth-247, which was destroyed in <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\"><i>Infinite Crisis</i></a>, and the \"Threeboot\" Legion came from the reconstructed Earth-Prime. After battle Threeboot Legion re-tuned to home reality, as for Earth-247 Legion chose to explore the multiverse calling themselves the \"Wanderers\" to search for survivors (See <i><a href=\"/final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/39-56073/\">Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds</a>)</i>.</p><h2><b>Rules governing the Legion</b></h2><h3><b>According to its constitution, are the following (Pre-Zero Hour):</b></h3><ul><li>The Legion may contain no more than 25 members, but the Club may have any number of part-time reserve members (<em>Action Comics</em> No. 387/2).</li><li>No member can be over the 18 years of age, must have at least one super-power that he or she can \"fully control\" and must be \"courageous and of good character\".</li><li>To become a Legionnaire, a candidate must win a two-thirds vote of at least three-quarters of the acting membership.</li><li>All Legionnaires must continue to go to school when off duty.</li><li>A new leader is selected each year \"in a manner to be determined by a vote of three-quarters of the entire active membership.\" This leader need answer only to the Commissioner of the Science Police.</li><li>Unless it's a dire emergency, no Legionnaire may partake in more than five successive space missions without a rest period, to prevent \"space fatigue.\"</li><li>Legionnaires <i>must</i> salute in the presence of the Legion flag.</li><li>Members who refuse an order from the leader may be court-martialed and expelled form the Legion.</li><li>Cowardice, a loss of powers, and charging a fellow Legionnaire falsely are also grounds for dismissal.

Eventually after repairing sufficient realities to restore their own they would be sent home. If they didn't repair the realities, they would be sent home to skewed home worlds. These six heroes would become the founding members of the team. Blink, who would become their leader, was given a device called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tallus/18-40942/\">Tallus</a>, which would be used by the <a href=\"/timebroker/29-20085/\">Timebroker</a> to communicate with the group.

What to do with this? Marvel then began planning a Blink spin-off title, which went through several incarnations. One of the concepts was a Blink, X-Man and Morph book.</p><p>However this didn't really click, and around the same time there was a poll regarding <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-millenial-visions/49-18447/\">X-men Millennial Visions 2000</a>, a book containing nothing but alternate reality concepts. The poll was about which reality would get a mini-series, and the winner was Professor W's X-Men, a reality where <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> was crippled and led the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>.

Although the group is initially confused as to how they got there and who brought them there, their questions are soon answered by <a href=\"/timebroker/29-20085/\">The Timebroker</a>, a mysterious entity who claims to be a construct of the team's collective consciousness. He explains to them all that they have become 'unhinged' from time, that new events in their pasts have transpired and altered each of the paths they now live. He goes on to tell them that the only way to fix each of their time lines is to travel to numerous alternate realities and fix what has gone wrong, hopefully putting it back to where it should be. This in turn, should then create a domino effect that will return their reality to how it should be. He goes on to give the team the <a href=\"/tallus/18-40942/\">Tallus</a>, a communications device that will give the team their missions, and sends them on their way.</p><h3><b>First Mission: Find your greatest teacher.</b></h3><p>The Exiles arrive on Earth-1805, a reality where all mutants and super humans were imprisoned years ago. They are then instructed by the Tallus that their first mission is to \"find the one that would lead us\", which the Exiles eventually deduce to be <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a>, the leader of the X-Men in most of their home realities. The Exiles figure out where Xavier is being held prisoner and break in, successfully rescuing him. However, their luck suddenly changes as Xavier wakes up and attacks them, revealing to the Exiles that he is not the man he was in their realities, and is much different. In this reality, Magneto, instead of Xavier, was the one who wanted equal rights for mutants and humans, whereas Xavier wanted all humans exterminated.</p><p>After waking up from their attack, the Exiles realize the mistake they made by rushing into the situation without really any background information. After doing some research they track down Forge, who had helped build the prisons and in return was allowed to go free, and interrogate him. Eventually, after figuring out who they should have originally freed, they track down Magneto's location and attempt to free him, but discover the prison is set to explode. Realizing that they cannot possibly evacuate themselves and all the prisoners, Magnus sacrifices his own life in order to complete the mission and repair the timeline. After Magnus' death, the Exiles' new teammate is teleported in - <a>Sunfire</a>, a counterpart of <a href=\"/mariko-yashida/29-3196/\">Mariko Yashida</a> - and the Exiles carry on to the next reality.</p><h3>Second Mission: Kill Jean Grey.</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79007\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/79007-42362-sunfire_super.jpg\" title=\"Sunfire\"><img id=\"79007\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/79007-42362-sunfire_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sunfire\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sunfire</div></div></div></div><p>The team lands in a new reality (Earth-8649) on a <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a> battleship during the Trial of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>. In this reality <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean</a> herself became the <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Dark Phoenix</a>, and the Exiles goal this time is to make sure that she dies, otherwise she will destroy the galaxy. The mission does not bode well with most of the Exiles due to their feelings towards Jean in their home reality and Nocturne and Mimic refuse to take part in the mission. Blink tries to convince them that it must be done, feeding them information that the Tallus is telling her but they refuse to listen. Eventually the Tallus puts an end to the debate by showing them the worst of what Jean will go on to do, making it so real that they almost feel it.</p><p>The Exiles disguise themselves as a distant race of aliens whose home planet had been destroyed by The Phoenix and the Shi'ar allow them to take place in the Trial, fighting on their side. Later, Mimic admits to Blink that he doesn't believe he's good enough to lead the team and that her past experiences gives her a better chance. Although reluctant, she eventually agrees to take the leading role. Trouble occurs when this reality's Wolverine recognizes Mimic's scent and confronts him about what he's doing here, and the two get into a fight. Mimic manages to defeat Wolverine and Nocturne possesses him after the fight so that he won't tell anyone what he saw.</p><p>Once the trial begins the Exiles quickly get to work, already knowing what will happen, and subdue several of the X-Men. Nocturne battles her father, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, and defeats him easily, although she feels remorseful for doing it. The battle continues until the <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Dark Phoenix</a> emerges from inside Jean Grey, and she murders several of her teammates. The Exiles try to fight her, but are all discarded swiftly until Blink comes up with a plan to distract Phoenix, so that Wolverine and Angel can come in from the other side and kill her. Once the mission is over the Tallus immediately sends the Exiles to the next reality. By the end of the second mission it is already clear that some of the Exiles are becoming increasingly frustrated by the position they've been placed in.</p><h3><b>Third Mission: The Hulk</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79427\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/79427-44932-thunderbird_super.jpg\" title=\"T-Bird\"><img id=\"79427\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/79427-44932-thunderbird_medium.jpg\" alt=\"T-Bird\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">T-Bird</div></div></div></div><p>Next, the Exiles are sent to Earth-901237, and land in <a href=\"/canada/34-55868/\">Canada</a> . Almost as soon as the Exiles arrive they run into the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> and a fight ensues, which the Exiles lose quickly. It's also revealed that <a href=\"/mimic/29-12546/\">Mimic</a> cannot be in close proximity with the Hulk due to his absorption powers, which meant he was absorbing Gamma rays which were making him violently sick. After the fight they then meet up with <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a>, lead by <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, who question what the Exiles are doing on their territory. After the Exiles explain their situation Alpha Flight agree to let them stay with them until their mission is complete. However, the Exiles had still not been informed as to what their mission in this reality was and it wasn't until halfway through a team briefing on the Hulk when the Tallus informed Blink what the mission was. It explained to her that three months ago the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> and a creature known as VOXON fought and caused the deaths of three people and the destruction of six city blocks. The Hulk then went on a rampage, bringing chaos with him wherever he went and Alpha Flight was left responsible to deal with the monster. However, the Tallus went on to explain that a fight between the Hulk and <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a> would lead to the deaths of all members of the team, and the Exiles had to stop this from occurring. Blink talks to Mimic later that night about what the Tallus told her and the two flirt, and eventually kiss.</p><p>However, the Exiles are not alone in this reality and it's revealed that there is another group of Exiles, named <a href=\"/weapon-x/65-50418/\">Weapon X</a> - made up of Blink's father figure - <a href=\"/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>, <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> and Kane. They are shown to be watching the Exiles from a distance and talk about how they'll be the ones to bring down the Hulk.</p><p>Later, T-Bird and Alpha Flight's <a href=\"/shaman/29-5017/\">Shaman</a>, who were both versions of <a href=\"/thunderbird/29-2174/\">John Proudstar</a>, went for a walk together. T-Bird found it hard to be around this version of himself due to the drastic differences between the two and saw Shaman as a version of himself he could never become. However, he also found it comforting to be able to be with someone alike to his brother as well, whom he missed. During the walk, the two bumped into the Hulk and although things were calm to begin with and they were able to reason with the Hulk, Weapon X's interference by shooting the Hulk in the head lead to a fight. T-Bird managed to best The Hulk this time and when the Hulk was defeated Weapon X decided it was their time to move in. However, they were stopped in their tracks by the arrival of the other Exiles, Blink included. Sabretooth immediately recognised Blink and watched from a distance but Weapon X was then teleported out of the reality, even though they had failed their mission. After the Hulk had been defeated Nocturne congratulates T-Bird and the two go on to talk about <a href=\"/warpath/29-2158/\">James Proudstar</a> - Nocturne's boyfriend and T-Bird's deceased brother. T-Bird tells Nocturne how much he misses him and the two then kiss, something they don't mention to their teammates. The Exiles spent one more night in Canada, unaware that they had come so close to meeting Weapon X.</p><h3><b>Galactus</b></h3><p>After enduring numerous more mission in alternate realities the Exiles are then sent to an Earth that had been taken over by <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> years ago and the planet was under complete control by them. Humans had been exiled to the outskirts of society and superhumans had been forced to take part in gladiator style games, often to the death. The Exiles are caught by surprise when they first arrive and <a href=\"/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a>, <a href=\"/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a>, <a href=\"/mimic/29-12546/\">Mimic</a> and Nocturne are all captured whilst Blink manages to teleport herself and Morph away from danger. The captured Exiles are forced to take part in the Games and due to their backgrounds fighting crime, excelled in their battles against the other competitors. However, they were exhausted and were quickly running out of hope. Meanwhile, Blink and Morph attempted to rescue the others several times but failed and they eventually seek out help from <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> - Mr Fantastic. However, before he could help the Exiles, the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> evacuate the planet as they had received information telling them that <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a> was coming to feed on the planet. It was then revealed to Blink that their mission was to make sure Galactus didn't destroy Earth.</p><p>Following the Skrull's evacuation, the cells holding all of the superhumans are opened and when Galactus' Herald; <a href=\"/terrax/29-2106/\">Terrax</a> arrives, their combined effort manages to defeat him. The captured Exiles and the others reunite and Blink and Mimic kiss. They then form a plan to defeat Galactus which involves setting off a bomb from inside Galactus' armor, which would need somebody with amazing strength to pull off. However, before the plan can be carried out</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"705039\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35376/705039-heather03_super.jpg\" title=\"Sasquatch\"><img id=\"705039\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35376/705039-heather03_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sasquatch\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sasquatch</div></div></div></div><p>T-Bird reveals to the team that Nocturne is pregnant with his baby, and tells them that she shouldn't have to take part in the mission. Nocturne argues with T-Bird, telling him that she's fine and the team needs her, which they agree with. The two share a quiet moment together but are soon called for duty. Galactus arrives on the planet and the battle begins, and with most of the Exiles' preliminary attacks failing they resort to their original plan. Although it was to be the Hulk whom would deliver the blow to Galactus originally, T-Bird is the only one left to do it and the attack almost kills him. Galactus flees the planet but T-Bird is left in a coma. When Nocturne is informed of T-Bird's condition she is distraught, and even more so when the Tallus tells Blink that they're moving on from this reality, without Thunderbird. The Exiles are the joined by new member <a href=\"/heather-hudson/29-9846/\">Heather Hudson</a> - <a href=\"/sasquatch/29-1478/\">Sasquatch</a>.</p><h3>Post-Galactus</h3><p>Nocturne sobs over losing her lover as the rest of the team can only look on sadly. Morph barges into her room, trying to cheer her up and convince her to join the rest of the team having fun. She curtly responds no, and Morph lets her know that she's not the only one who misses T-Bird and that the offer to join them is always good. He leaves. Nocturne looks at the roses in the room and remembers about when she had a talk with T-Bird during when they had to kill Phoenix. She teased him that he didn't seem to like flowers, he compared himself to Ferdinand the Bull, meant for fighting but always wanting something else. Later, in their Alpha Flight mission, TJ and John spoke about Nocturne's home world. Morph comes up in the conversation and Nocturne tells T-Bird that Morph thinks T-Bird hates him. John admits he does, but then says he only envies him because he's free.</p><p>In a mission to Savage Land Thunderbird suggests they stop their relationship, even though Mimic and Blink are okay with it. He wants to face it and not seek refuge with Nocturne, to which TJ storms off angered. On a world where <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> was president he tried to make amends with the break up, and always wondered how a beautiful women like TJ would love a \"twisted\" man like him. She kisses him and tears roll down her cheek and says she wouldn't want anyone else. Back to the battle with Galactus, she tells him that she's pregnant with his child, but it couldn't have been a worse time since their fighting. He couldn't be happier. He was going to be a father, and was determined to fight to stay alive to teach his child about Ferdinand the Bull. Back in her hotel room, Nocturne clutches the flowers to her chest and tells the empty room that she can't fight without Thunderbird, and falls back onto the bed sobbing.</p><h2>Team Roster</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"211497\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/211497-39961-exiles_super.jpg\" title=\"The Exiles - Past &amp; Present\"><img id=\"211497\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/211497-39961-exiles_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Exiles - Past &amp; Present\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Exiles - Past & Present</div></div></div></div><p><b>Blink</b></p><p>Clarice Ferguson - Earth-295</p><p>Joins team in Exiles #1</p><p>Absent from team between Exiles 22-37, quits in #100, rejoins before Exiles vol. 2 #1</p><h3>Mimic</h3><p>Calvin Rankin - Earth-12</p><p>Joins team in Exiles #1</p><p>Possessed by Proteus in Exiles #71, dies in #73.</p><h3>Morph</h3><p>Kevin Sidney - Earth-1084</p><p>Joins team in Exiles #1</p><p>Possessed by Proteus since Exiles #80, Merged with Proteus in New Exiles Annual.

        "description":"\n<h2>Origin</h2>\n<p>Agamemnon, the immortal offspring of human and an Asgardian god founded the Pantheon. The Pantheon was built over hundreds of years with its membership coming from Agamemnon\u2019s own super-powered children. Agamemnon came to an agreement with an alien empire known as the Troyjan. In exchange for knowledge of genetic engineering that would allow the descendants of Agamemnon to maintain the superpowers derived from Agamemnon\u2019s Asgardian heritage. In return for this information, Agamemnon agreed to give the Troyjan one of his descendants. Over time, the organization grew world wide with more than a dozen super powered beings and a human staff in the thousands. &nbsp; </p>\n<h2>Creation</h2>\n<p>The Pantheon was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wikid/peter-david/26-40682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter David</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wikid/dale-keown/26-1827/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dale Keown</a> in 1990 and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wikid/the-incredible-hulk/49-2406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Incredible Hulk</a> </p>\n<h2>Evolution</h2>\n<p>The Pantheon existed in the shadows for centuries, with little known of the organization until the modern age. What is known, is that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agamemnon/29-25967/\">Agamemnon</a> used his precognitives to determine when critical event were going to occur and would send teams out to insure the events came out in the manner that he preferred, usually under the mask of being what was best for humanity. His followers had little information about Agamemnon\u2019s true motives as he did not meet with them in person, but rather only appeared as a hologram in the form of a wizened sage, thus hiding from the rest of the Pantheon his true form, which was that of a sixteen-year-old boy. This isolation caused Agamemnon to go on \u201cwalk about\u201d every fifty years or so in order to keep in touch with humanity. It was after one of these \u201cwalk abouts\u201d that Agamemnon moved the headquarters of the Pantheon to the Nevada desert in the early 1950\u2019s, founding the \u201cMount\u201d. It is believed that during this time Agamemnon started the \u201cWarzone Project\u201d, a project so secrete that it was hidden from the other members of the Pantheon. &nbsp; </p>\n<p>In 1990 Agamemnon began preparing to go on \u201cwalk about\u201d, so he had to choose an interim leader for the Pantheon. Agamemnon sent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prometheus/29-46919/\">Prometheus</a> to recruit the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> to act as the temporary leader. </p>\n<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2>\n<h3>Troyjan War</h3>\n<p>As a result of the agreement made between Agamemnon and the Troyjan Empire, in which Agamemnon learned the methods to extend the lives and increase the powers of both himself and his descendants, the prince of the Troyjan Empire, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trauma/29-26469/\">Trauma</a>, decided he would take <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atalanta/29-20607/\">Atalanta</a> as his bride. &nbsp; Trauma kidnapped Atalanta and transported her off to the Troyjan home world. &nbsp; The Hulk immediately mounts a rescue party to retrieve Atalanta, tracking down the Trauma using the uncanny tracking ability of Prometheus. Eventually the Pantheon long with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> found Trauma, but were captured. They were brought before the Troyjan King, where they were informed of Agamemnon\u2019s duplicity. The Pantheon members were imprisoned to await the impending wedding. A rescue party of consisting of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">Starjammers</a>, and remaining members of Pantheon arrived and battle ensued, where Trauma was mortally wounded. His last request was the Atalanta and the Pantheon be released.</p>\n<h3>Myth Conceptions</h3>\n<p>After the Troyjan War, the members of Pantheon determined that Agamemnon needed to stand trial for heinous agreement he made with the Troyjans. After tracking Agamemnon to Boston, he was returned to the Mount to be held accountable for his actions. Agamemnon admits to his actions, as well as admitting to having a member of Pantheon assassinated. He then tells everyone that they had no right to judge him, as he was the superior to the entire team. At that point Agamemnon unleashed his most heinous deception of all, the \u201cWarzone Project\u201d. The project involved taking the bodies of all the dead former members of the Pantheon from all time and cybernetically enhancing and animating the bodies, forming the legion of the Endless Knights, a hideous army of cyborg-zombies under Agamemnon\u2019s control. The Mount is evacuated and battle ensues. During the course of battle Banner looses control of the Hulk and reverts to his savage persona and Atalanta kills Agamemnon. After the battle, the Hulk is removed as team leader and banished from the Pantheon. </p>\n<h2>Members</h2>\n<p>All the members of Agamemnon\u2019s bloodline have superior strength and some from of a healing factor as well a having an extended life span.

        "description":"<p>There are several different phases to a Xenomorph's life-cycle, and different outcomes to what kind of adult Xenomorph will come out depending on the thing that it chest-bursts from.</p><h3><b>Egg</b></h3><p>Eggs are first created inside of a Alien Queen, and then exit her body through an grown egg sack. The Egg is a leathery sack approximately 2.5 feet tall. They are the very simple first step.</p><h3>Face-Hugger</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/face-hugger/18-49618/\">Face-Hugger</a> is what lays inside the Egg. After a certain amount of time or if a host were to come too close to a Egg, the Facehugger inside senses through pheromones, the Egg opens up like a blossoming flower, and the Facehugger launches itself out and plants itself on the hosts face. It's long tail will wrap around the hosts neck, and it will grip the head with it's long eight legs-the Facehugger resembles a flat spider, in a sense. It has acidic blood-if it is cut, it will bleed the acid on the victim, and if it is tried to be pried off, it's tail tightens around the hosts neck and a chemical will cause them to go into a cardiac arrest. The Facehugger also makes it's host unconscious with oxygen deprivation. Once the Alien egg is planted into the hosts body, the Face-Hugger will flee, and die shortly afterwords. The host will wake up with no recollection to the event.</p><h3><strong>Chest Burster</strong></h3><p>As time passes, the egg that was planted inside of the host will begin to stir. Then, it will begin to claw it's way out of the hosts chest, through the centre of his ribcage. This obviously causes extreme pain, and as soon as the Chest Burster breaks through, the host dies. It will then flee at top speeds to grow and become more dangerous.It's appearance changes in it's variations, but it is small, with a small cranium, pale or dark skin and a long tail-almost like a snake. Basically, Chest Bursters are infant versions of Xenomorphs. <strong>Young Alien</strong></p><p>After the chestburster it will shed its skin and change into an adult or it will cocoon itself and become a young alien before reaching the adult stage.</p><h3><strong>Adult</strong></h3><p>There are many different kinds of Adult Xenomorphs-however, they share the same general appearance. After the Chest Burster has fled, it will wait and mature, shedding it's old skin-revealing the darker kind-and it's head will expand backwards into a crescent shape. It will grow large arms and legs, it's tail will be longer and much stronger (even to the point of being able to impale fully grown Predator's), and it's blood will be much more acidic. Xenomorphs have many distinguishing features-they do not show up on infra-red scanners, as they take on the temperature of the environment (this contribute to their adaptability). Inside of their mouth is a second \"mouth\", in appearance-however, this is it's tongue, which has shown the strength to punch through a skull, steel,and the unknown metal of the Predator species. They (apparently) do not have visible eyes but they can see pheromones and inverted light which would explain how they can detect cloaked Predator's and see in the dark.</p><p>These Xenomorphs are the stuff of nightmares-they are vicious, cannot be reasoned with, and will never, ever give up. They are extremely intelligent and deadly able to remember through genetic memory there hosts life and past. They communicate with a queen and each other through changing pheromones and/or sub-supersonic sounds.</p><h3><b>Variations</b></h3><p>There are several variations of adult Xenomorphs. They most well-known are the \"Warrior\" brood. These are the ones that appeared in both ALIEN and ALIENS-they have the long crescent head, dark skin, and deadly tongue. The next type was the \"Runner\"-this is the Xenomorph that appeared in ALIEN3. Xenomorph's take the characteristics of the host from which they hatched. This would explain why the Xenomorph in the third movie ran on all fours commonly, since it hatched from a dog. This brood is fast and agile. This Alien is only known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dog-alien/29-52595/\">Dog Alien</a>. Another brood seemed to appear in ALIEN-RESURRECTION however these could have been an unfortunate side effect of crossing genes need for cloning Ellen Ripley and the adolescent alien Queen. It had the appearance of a Warrior, but had darker skin, was able to easily swim through water. In this one the aliens also appeared to show that they possessed a consciousness.</p><p>In ALIEN RESURRECTION, there appeared an Alien that is half human/half-Xenomorph. It looks more human than Xenomorph, as it has no tail, it normally walks on 2 legs, and the skin isn't black. They look somewhat like newborn babies. The alien was a gift to Ellen Ripley (the queen had gotten the reproduction genes she however was sterile) the mother (host) of the alien queen who took the human genes from her body and used alien ones to fill the gaps in the DNA.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/predalien/29-49598/\">Predalien</a></h3><p>There are two types. One look like an alien with a spike covered turtle shell. Not much is known of of this type except that it's resistant to low caliber ammunition. The other type was created when a face-hugger latched onto a Predator's face, causing the offspring to be a hybrid between Alien and Predator. The Predalien looks the same as an ordinary Alien except it has Predator mandibles on it's mouth and it has the enlarged forehead of a Predator with black dreadlocks coming out. It also doesn't require a face-hugger to harvest new Aliens, as it's tongue is capable of projecting Xenomorph embryos into hosts, in one case, up to 20 embryos have been planted by the Predalien into one host. Predaliens also appear to be stronger than normal Predators, as it is capable of pinning one to the wall with one hand.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alien-queen/29-52594/\">Alien Queen</a></h3><p>The Queen is the center of all Xenomorphs in the colony-it is what births them, and is the strongest, largest, and fastest. When it's mounted in a structure constructed by either her or servants, it is stuck in place, and births the Eggs from which the Face-Huggers launch. However, it can detach itself painfully from it's confine's , and stand fully tall. It's appearance is like that of a adult Xenomorph, but has slight differences. It has a large, wide head, instead of the crescent, and it's main body is skinny. It has 4-6 arms ,two are extremely small two or four are long and powerful, as with it's legs. It is the size of three human standing on one another-it was a massive killing machine in the movie \"Alien Vs. Predator\" and an extremely angry mother in Aliens.</p><p>The Queen's only job is to reproduce a.k.a make lots of little aliens in eggs. The queen comes with a huge \"sack\" in which the little bundles of alien joy are stored. when the queen has a mood swing the sack rips in a grand explosion of slime . She then will proceed to chase you down until you are in her belly</p><h2>Connection To Predators</h2><p>Xenomorphs and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/predator/29-51361/\">Yautja</a> have a long history with one another. The Yautja will, when in need of a new Queen, raid a Xenomorph colony and steal one. They will then use that Queen to make several Eggs, and then they will plant the Eggs in on a planet. Inevitably, a Xenomorph outbreak will occur, in which the Yautja will send their rookie Hunters to the planet to claim their first kills. After the Yautja return from their first hunt, another group of experienced Hunters will come and exterminate all trace of the Xenomorphs, returning the planet to it's natural balance.</p><p>However, occasionally a few Xenomorphs escape the slaughter. If that were to occur, the planet is lost to the creatures.</p><h2>Aliens (2009 Mini-Series)</h2><p>The Alien mini-series follows David Serena, a captain of a star ship headed for Planet Chione.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p><b>Aliens: Cauldron</b> - <i>Space: the most hostile environment in the universe.

They are <a href=\"/shining-knight/29-6890/\">                   Shining Knight</a>, Vigilante, <a href=\"/star-spangled-kid/29-10998/\">                       Star-Spangled Kid</a>, <a href=\"/green-arrow/29-5936/\">                        Green Arrow</a>, <a href=\"/speedy/29-5300/\">                      Speedy</a>, <a href=\"/stripesy/29-30289/\">                     Stripesy</a>, and The <a href=\"/crimson-avenger/29-11175/\">                    Crimson Avenger</a>. The Leader of the team is Shining Knight.</p> <p>The 7 Soldiers of Victory were also known as the Law's Legionairres. In 1941, a criminal mastermind known only as the hand was informed that he had less than a month to live. To ensure that the world remembered him long after he died, the hand passed on his most ingenious unused plans to other criminals who would commit these crimes in his name.</p> <p>He sent his plans to <a href=\"/the-dummy/29-6177/\">                         The Dummy</a>, <a href=\"/big-caesar/29-37327/\">                         Big Caesar</a>, <a href=\"/the-needle/29-37325/\">                         the Needle</a>, Professor Merlin and the  Red Dragon, whom he referred to as his \"five fingers.\" The hand then issued a challenge to the Vigilante, Shining Knight, Crimson Avenger, Green Arrow &amp; Speedy, and the Star Spangled Kid and Stripesy to stp them.</p> <p>Thus the Vigilante had his first encounter with and victory over the Dummy, and the Star Spangled Kid and Stripesy overcame their old foe the Needle. When the other heroes also triumphed over their opponents, the hand decided he would have to kill them himself.</p> <p>Hearing fron his doctor that a cure had been found for his condition, the Hand realised he would have to overcome the heroes in order to escape prison and live out the rest of his life in freedom. He decided to invite the heroes to his home, which was full of deadly traps.</p> <p>During the battle that followed, the Hand aimed a \"lightning ray\" machine at the heroes. The Vigilante shot the machine down and the Hand was seemingly killed by electrocution as a result. After their victory, the Shining Knight suggested that they become a regular team. Therefore they became the Seven Soldiers of Victory, with Wing, the Crimson Avenger's sidekick becoming the unofficial \"8th\" member of the team.</p> <p>A number of years later, after the 7 Soldiers had shared many adventures, they battled a strange and immensly powerful foe known as the Nebula-Man. Wing sacrificed his life in order to overcome the Nebula Man with a device known as the Nebula-rod. The force released by the climactic battle hurled the 7 Soldiers into various time periods of Earth's past. Decades later, the JLA and JSA went back in time in order to bring the Seven Soldiers back to the present. (JLA #100 - #102) 1st series.</p> <p>The 7 Soldiers had only spent a comparatively short time in the past, and so when they returned with the JLA and JSA they were only a little older than when they left the 20th Century in the first place. <br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h2>Second Team</h2>&nbsp;Years after the Golden Age team formed, when the villain <a href=\"/agamemno/29-55832/\">           Agamemno </a>attacked Earth and switched the minds of the<a href=\"/justice-league/65-55928/\">                Justice League</a> and the<a href=\"/injustice-league/65-22672/\">               Injustice League</a>, <a href=\"/deadman/29-5690/\">            Deadman </a>rounded up several disparate super heroes for a one time mission when he found out that the Injustice League were going to attack the planet <a href=\"/rann/34-55709/\">             Rann</a>.

        "description":"<p>Each member of the Terrible Trio concentrates his inventions for a particular battleground. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fox/29-38834/\">Fox </a>specialises in inventions for committing crimes on land, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shark/29-50891/\">Shark </a>devotes himself to commiting crimes at sea or underwater and the<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vulture/29-38835/\"> Vulture</a> concentrates on advanced aircraft for committing crimes in the sky. The Trio do not wear costumes except for head masks resembling the animals for which they are named.</p>\n<p>The Terrible Trio are based in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gotham-city/34-23611/\">Gotham City</a> and have often been faced by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dick-grayson/29-1691/\"> Dick Grayson</a>). They first came to Batman's attention when they sucessfully robbed a cruise ship (sea crime) and a Gotham City Bank (land crime). The Vulture then robbed a plane while it was in mid-air. Batman and Robin then clashed with the Trio, who escaped, but without the loot from the Vulture's robbery. The Trio had committed a crime on sea, land and air, and Batman deduced that they would continue in that sequence. He and Robin hid aboard the SS Cairo, which was transporting valuable Egyptian artifacts. As Batman had hoped, the Trio looted the ship and brought the Mummy cases (in which the dynamic duo were hiding) to their hideout. Batman and Robin caught the Trio by surprise and aprrehended the three villains.</p>\n<p>The Terrible Trio then escaped from prison and turned to smuggling. They smuggled diamonds using homing pigeons (air crime) and plates for counterfeit money using dolphins (a sea crime). Believing the Trio would next transport fugitives from the law out of Gotham City as their land based smuggling operation, Batman contacted the Trio in the guise of an escaped convict. Once at the Trio's lair, Batman summoned Robin and they fought the inventors, but this time it was the Trio who captured the crime fighters. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batwoman/29-9052/\">Batwoman</a> helped the Caped Crusaders escape the death traps that the Trio had left them in and they once again pusued and captured the villains.</p>\n<p>Among the unusual vehicles the Trio used were the Fox's \"burrow machine\" which can drill through the earth or steel walls; the Shark's \"eel machine\" which can travel underwater, his \"pilot fish machine\" which can drill holes in the sides of ships, and the Vulture's \"missile machine\" for high speed air travel. The Trio also used robots in the forms of flying stingrays and vultures. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;In Other Media</h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>Television&nbsp;<br /></h3>&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<h3>Batman: The Animated Series&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></h3>The Terrible Trio had their own episode&nbsp;in which they were rich but bored.

The Terrible Trio are university students and social outcasts named David, Justin, and Amber. Instead of costumes, they mutated by using formulas stolen from Dr. Kirk Langstrom's computer. David\u2014the brains and de facto leader of their group\u2014remade the forumla and put it into dissolving patches. After applying one each, David became a therianthropic Fox, Justin became a therianthropic Shark (resembling a hammerhead shark), and Amber became a therianthropic Vulture.&nbsp; \n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1332983\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34565/1332983-tb_terrible_trio_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1332983\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34565/1332983-tb_terrible_trio_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><br />Throughout the episode, their schemes were mostly for amusement and vindication, rather than financial gain. One recurring theme was turning others into therianthropes against their will. Since Batgirl went to the same college, she assisted Batman in capturing them. After receiving a DNA sample from a feather belonging to Vulture, Langstrom also provided an antidote to the mutations. After some difficulty, Batman and Batgirl administered the antidote to Justin and Amber, respectively. David, however, was accidentally covered in a mutagenic fluid meant for several other students when Batman destroyed the mutagen detonator. This turned him into a horned Griffin-like creature. After being electrocuted by the stadium sign and presumably cured, David was sent to prison with Justin while Amber was presumably sent to a women's prison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><b>Batman: The Brave and the Bold&nbsp;</b><br />&nbsp;<br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1655100\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1655100-terrible_trio_super.jpg\" title=\"Trio attacks\"><img id=\"1655100\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1655100-terrible_trio_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Trio attacks\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Trio attacks</div></div></div></div>They appear in eleventh episode of the first season.

        "description":"<p>The Winter Guard was born from the remains of two of Russia's most powerful teams - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siberforce/65-56087/\">Siberforce</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-protectorate/65-56088/\">The Protectorate</a>. The initial line-up included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantasma/29-28670/\">Fantasma</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sibercat/29-16125/\">Sibercat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/powersurge/29-60583/\">Powersurge</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vanguard/29-13804/\">Vanguard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vostok/29-28669/\">Vostok</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steel-guardian/29-19930/\">Steel Guardian</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkstar/29-10990/\">Darkstar</a>.</p><p>After Darkstar's death in NEW X-MEN, the team began to experience greater discord among its members. Vanguard, Vostok, Powersurge, Fantasma, Steel Guardian, and Sibercat resigned in disgust - and were considered 'missing.'</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ursa-major/29-13826/\">Ursa Major</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson-dynamo/29-7234/\">Crimson Dynamo</a> (Dmitri Bukharin) remained. Red Guardian (Krassno Granitsky) who had briefly teamed up with Maverick to stop mobster, Ivan Pushkin, was brought on to replace Steel Guardian in the roster, but he was later killed.</p><p>After this incident and the tragic death of Darkstar, the Russian Executive Security Committee saw value in the public reputation established by The Winter Guard and stepped in to help reassure the Russian people that the Winter Guard was still as robust as ever.</p><p>Quickly, they assembled an elite pool of candidates that would step into the shoes of Russia's most iconic heroes if they were ever to fall in battle. After elaborate physical and psychological testing, a sixth hero stepped into the role of Red Guardian. Sasha Roerich became the second Darkstar when it was clear that she best matched the 'power profile' of the original Darkstar.The Russian government also took elaborate steps to reclaim all of the rogue Crimson Dynamo armors that had been used for illegal purposes (the armors used by Gennady Gavrilov, and the 9th, 10th, and 11th Dynamos, and the Airstrike armor, etc...).</p><p>As Dmitri Bukharin reached his retirement age, he was given his own personal suit of armor as a reward for extraordinary service and he was assigned as the Winter Guard's new liaison. Qualified test pilot, Boris Vadim stepped into to fill his shoes as the 12th Crimson Dynamo.</p><p>This 'NEW' WINTER GUARD is supported by the Russian Executive Security Committee - they are given the same status and glory that the Avengers or Fantastic Four had - they are the 'officially sanctioned team' - their headquarters is stationed in the old Dire Wraith Science Citadel (which they just call 'The Citadel'). Their supersonic aircraft is called the Sovereign.</p><p>Unlike other superhero teams, The Winter Guard currently has a rotating pool of candidates to fill one of four roles on the team: Darkstar, Crimson Dynamo, Red Guardian, and Ursa Major. The current roster consists of a third Darkstar, seventh Red Guardian, thirteenth Crimson Dynamo and the one-and-only Ursa Major.</p><p>Recently, the Winter Guard encountered <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She Hulk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doc-samson/29-4315/\">Doc Samson</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\">General Thunderbolt Ross</a> who were investigating the death of Emil Blonsky aka the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abomination/29-3489/\">Abomination</a>. Over the last several months, the team has tussled with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/war-machine/29-1926/\">War Machine</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-liberators/65-46791/\">Lady Liberator</a>s, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-mandarin/29-3530/\">Mandarin</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/presence/29-11340/\">Presence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/igor-drenkov/29-27723/\">Igor Drenkov</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remont-six/65-57169/\">Remont Six</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krang/29-13401/\">Krang</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hyperion/29-6911/\">Hyperion</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dire-wraiths/65-14015/\">Dire Wraiths</a>.</p>",

Canary then invited the usually villainous <a href=\"/poison-ivy/29-1697/\">Poison Ivy</a>, much to the consternation of Starling and Katana, who expressed their displeasure with the new recruit by attacking Ivy on first sight. Ivy easily fended off their attacks and is now on the roster, though it remains to be seen how well she will fit in with the team. Together they are trying to stop a villain with the codename \"Choke\" and soldiers with invisible suits called \"Cleaners\". The Birds of prey will soon be battling the Court of Owls alongside the rest of the Bat-family in the Night Of The Owls event.</p><h2>Origin</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"78787\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/78787-48090-birds-of-prey_super.jpg\" title=\"The three mainstays of the team\"><img id=\"78787\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/78787-48090-birds-of-prey_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The three mainstays of the team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The three mainstays of the team</div></div></div></div><p>Originally the Birds of Prey consisted only of <a href=\"/black-canary/29-1689/\">Black Canary</a> and <a href=\"/oracle/29-5368/\">Oracle</a>.

Some time later Black Canary walked into a trap and Oracle was forced to call in the <a href=\"/huntress/29-1690/\">Huntress</a>. After a successful outcome to this event, the trio formed the core of the Birds of Prey. The group operated out of the <a href=\"/clocktower/34-41480/\">Clocktower</a> in <a href=\"/gotham-city/34-23611/\">Gotham</a> for a time before a move to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a> and later <a href=\"/platinum-flatts/34-55720/\">Platinum Flatts</a>.

Mr. Tan however, has hired the <a href=\"/twelve-brothers-in-silk/65-58025/\">Twelve Brothers In Silk</a>.

They collect the bound and gagged policeman and leave the building.</p><p>Back in Gotham, Huntress is muscling in on the local mobs with Savant and Creote as her backup. She uses her family history as a <a href=\"/bertinelli-mob/65-57751/\">Bertinelli</a> to get attention at a meeting of the family leaders. She wants a spot among them and had Savant use his blackmailing skills to get incriminating information on all of them.

He shames Rabbit and sends him away. After making his apologies he agrees to the deal with no further tests.

Tan's competitors are trying to frame them. Dinah and Ted make a run for the Aerie One that Zinda is taxiing for takeoff.</p><p>In the air with fighter jets on their tail, Zinda tries to outfly them. The Aerie One's virtual armor stands up to missile fire and Zinda uses a feature that messes with the instruments of the jets without downing them. Black Canary tends to Oracle who is on the floor weakened, and having trouble staying conscious. Seeing a man she doesn't recognize get out of a mob bosses car, Huntress wants to harass him. Her punch is blocked and she is flipped to the ground by the she now recognizes as <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Dick Grayson</a>.

She relays the tip to Black Canary that Mr. Tan is bringing his huge drug shipment in anyways and it will be guarded by the <a href=\"/twelve-brothers-in-silk/65-58025/\">Twelve Brothers In Silk</a>.

The team tracks Tabby to a limo with two dead D.E.O. Agents. Huntress suspects She shot her father and it's almost confirmed when she wonders aloud what it will be like running her father's mob. Manhunter and Gypsy shut down the metahuman trafficking ring. After Spy Smasher threatens Barbara's father Oracle agrees to work for her.</p><p>Barbara informs Helena on the Aerie One immediately following the Tabby Brennan incident. Misfit is holding a tray for Barda to put the bullets she picks out of herself in. Oracle wants them to drop Misfit off and then pick up supplies for their mission in Baku, the capitol city of the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijani. They are after a man named General Feodor Kerimov for massive drug importation and human trafficking, among other things, throughout Europe and the Americas.

Helena dances with Catman but that ends after he licks her neck. She flings meatballs at him afterwards. The General delivers a speech and reveals he is selling a Rocket Red Suit. Knockout recognizes Barda as they are both warriors from <a href=\"/apokolips/34-41470/\">Apokolips</a> so Barda clocks her in the face, grabs the Suit and jumps out of a window.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1653742\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1653742-ptdc0022_super.jpg\" title=\"Discovering Ice\"><img id=\"1653742\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1653742-ptdc0022_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Discovering Ice\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Discovering Ice</div></div></div></div><p>The team flees in a van with the Six, minus Scandal, on their tails.

Inside the van Barda picks open the Rocket Red Suit and they fin <a href=\"/ice/29-2051/\">Ice</a> inside. She was thought dead for a while and Oracle along with the rest of the team is pretty surprised. In a dark basement the General slits a mans throat hoping to soon resurrect Rasputin. The Secret Six's newest member, <a href=\"/harley-quinn/29-1696/\">Harley Quinn</a>, arrives with a stolen car as their ride. Hawkgirl grabs Scandal off of the motorcycle and brings her in the air. Scandal punches and slashes at her and they crash to the ground and begin to fight. The rest of the team makes to the rendezvous which is an old barn.</p><p>Spy Smasher's guy greets them and takes them in. Ice is sort of regaining consciousness and Barda carries her inside. Things soon get out of hand and end up in a standoff with Huntress and Barda against Katarina and Manhunter. Before anyone can make a move, the Generals men show up along with the Secret Six.

Misfit does the math and realizes the numbers aren't fair so she teleports all the way there and starts a fight with Harley Quinn. Manhunter and Ragdoll go at it and Huntress battles with Catman leaving Hawkgirl and Scandal to pick up where they left off earlier. They all fight for a time and Deadshot ends up shooting Scandal in the back by mistake. Creote has been left to watch Ice and he's trying to wake her up by slapping her repeatedly. Huntress and Catman fall down a small hill and she lands on him. After flirting for a second she stabs him in the leg with two crossbow bolts.

The snow swirls and she projects her image through a huge icewoman demanding to know who murdered her. Catman and Huntress call a truce and she helps him to his feet and up the hill. The rest of them though keep fighting even with Ice's giant ice creature threatening to kill them all. Helena and Catman talk some sense into their teams and everyone stops fighting except for Barda and Knockout.</p><p>The General has ordered Rocket Reds to burn everything and everyone in the area and they've arrived to do so. The Birds and the Six team up to stop them. The General shows up to try and control Ice but Deadshot shoots him in the head. The Birds get a ride from Lady Blackhawk who has apparently stolen a van and the teams go their separate ways. Barda and Knockout shake hands. Spy Smasher is angry Zinda disobeyed orders by coming there and she fires her. Zinda punches Katarina in the face while telling her to go to hell. Lady Blackhawk says she'll walk and disappears in the woods.

Barbara asks which one of them invited Shiva and they thought she did. Dinah and Helena go dancing while Zinda and Barbara run a little errand. One of the few useful things Katarina did was leave Oracle a file with information in it. An address that leads them to a condemned burnt out building where Misfit lives. The stuff about her being rich and popular was a lie. She's homeless and poor. Oracle learns her real name is Charlotte Gage-Radcliffe and then invites her to come live with her.</p><p>Oracle tries to talk Black Canary out of marrying Green Arrow. Misfit is tasked with watching <a href=\"/sin/29-45309/\">Sin</a> so they can have a quiet dinner. <a href=\"/big-barda/29-3628/\">Big Barda</a> is talking to her husband, Mr. Miracle, on the phone. Someone is killing <a href=\"/new-gods/65-40647/\">New Gods</a>. Misfit asks her help and Barda ends up playing a card game with Sin. Canary is getting angry at Babs for trying to talk her out of it. <a href=\"/knockout/29-17771/\">Knockout</a> is on an adjacent rooftop to finish the fight with Barda. Someone else is there to kill Barda and Knockout stops him. He says he's really there for her and kills her then tosses her body off of the roof. Misfit bounces down but it's too late. Canary and Barbara calm down and Dinah asks her to be her Maid of Honor if she decides to accept Ollie's proposal.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1688010\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1688010-kidding_super.jpg\" title=\"Kidding\"><img id=\"1688010\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1688010-kidding_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kidding\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kidding</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/calculator/29-2545/\">Calculator</a> kills a computer tech guy and steals his ID and his thumb to get into a building which houses something he cannot access wirelessly.

A hard drive from what's left of the computer she used in the <a href=\"/clocktower/34-41480/\">Clocktower</a>.

Oracle succeeds in deleting the files and Calculator hears her yell in victory. He finds and shoots at her but she's hiding and cracks him in the leg with her Eskirma stick. <a href=\"/hellhound/29-22546/\">Hellhound</a> shows up and throws her off of him. Huntress wants Misfit to bounce her in but Misfit's powers don't work that way. Misfit has a better idea anyways. Just as Oracle is about to be kidnapped and tortured for information, a hundred computer nerds show up and they've called the cops. Misfit figured Oracle had a file on everyone attending including phone numbers so she sent them all a text message to help Babs.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1474370\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54403/1474370-blackalice6_super.jpg\" title=\"Learning about the blood results\"><img id=\"1474370\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54403/1474370-blackalice6_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Learning about the blood results\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Learning about the blood results</div></div></div></div><p>While visiting her old home, Misfit is kidnapped, drugged and forced to engage in fights at <a href=\"/the-dark-side-club/34-55480/\">The Dark Side Club</a>. After defeating <a href=\"/livewire/29-4678/\">Livewire</a> she is 5-0. In a moment of clarity she attacks one of her captors, Granny Goodness. Granny has her thrown back in her cell where <a href=\"/black-alice/29-41210/\">Black Alice</a> is waiting. Black Alice's antidepressants are suppressing the drugs Granny gave her but she can't grab anyone elses' magic. She tries to talk Misfit into bouncing out but she doesn't. Misfit also refuses to take Lori with her. She can't teleport with anyone which she found out the hard way trying to bounce with her dog one time. Black Alice steals Misfit's ability since it's magic based and leaves. While wandering the complex Black Alice overhears Granny talking to a Doctor about samples and learns her and Misfit are blood relatives. Boss Dark Side sedates her before she can find out how they are related.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1688013\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1688013-why_misfit_doesn_t_bounce_people_with_her_super.jpg\" title=\"Why Misfit doesn't bounce with people\"><img id=\"1688013\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1688013-why_misfit_doesn_t_bounce_people_with_her_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Why Misfit doesn't bounce with people\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Why Misfit doesn't bounce with people</div></div></div></div><p>The next day they are pitted against each other. Misfit is furious at Black Alice for leaving her there and the drugs they have her on are making her hatred worse. Black Alice tries to talk but Misfit teleports and knocks Lori to the ground. Her patience run out, Black Alice grabs the magic of <a href=\"/etrigan-the-demon/29-7367/\">Etrigan the Demon</a> and burns Misfit with a blast of fire. Lori is prepared to kill her when she remembers they are related and stops herself. She won't be anyone's toy. Granny shoots another dose of \"Fight Juice\" at her but she teleports out of the way and behind Granny. Granny was ready for that and sticks her in the leg with a syringe telling her to just kill Misfit like she knows she wants to. Lori says she might but first they should step outside. Misfit yells trying to stop her but Black Alice bounces Granny outside where Granny explodes instantly. With her powers back Misfit teleports out right away which immediately heals her burns. Outside Lori hands Misfit a note and tells her to go back to Oracle before she is caught all over again. Oracle's tests show the drug is gone from Misfit's system and she could use some downtime. Inside her bedroom, Misfit reads the note and learns they are blood relatives.</p><p>A short time later Tabby Brennan is seen again. Helena's mob contact says Tabby was laughed at when she tries to take over her father's spot. Pretty angry at their reactions she buys a truckload of weapons and plans to murder her way in. Oracle dispatches the Birds last minute to intercept the weapon trade but Tabby manages to escape with the truck full of weapons and is heading for Metropolis with Huntress on her tail. Just inside the city, Tabby his a button inside the truck and it transforms into a huge robot with her behind the controls. There are no schematics so Oracle can't find a weakness and Huntress can't talk Tabby out so Misfit bounces in the cockpit and knocks out Tabby. Both Oracle and Huntress yell at her not to touch anything but she presses a button anyways. The switch is a self destruct type thing and turns into a whirlwind of arcing purple energy. Misfit wants to save Tabby who is unconscious but Oracle says their is nothing they can do for her and makes Misfit bounce out.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1922076\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1922076-crater_super.jpg\" title=\"Crater\"><img id=\"1922076\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1922076-crater_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Crater\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Crater</div></div></div></div><p>The whirlwind reaches a diameter of a few city blocks and finally flashes out. Huntress barely escapes and Lady Black narrowly avoids getting sucked in in the Aerie Two. Where the vortex was is now an empty hole. Everything that was there is now dust. Buildings are cut clean and all inside are presumed dead. The next day they are all sitting around still distraught over the tragedy when <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> arrives through a window to lecture them. Oracle stands up to him and he leaves. Following this Oracle goes in to overdrive searching for whoever manufactured the transforming truck. She has several people checking for her. She is especially hard on Misfit even breaking her ankle while sparring (she knew she'd heal though). Misfit has a hard time but does everything Barbara asks of her. When Black Alice joins the team her and Misfit clash.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1922073\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1922073-got_it_super.jpg\" title=\"Found it\"><img id=\"1922073\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82762/1922073-got_it_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Found it\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Found it</div></div></div></div><p>Oracle sends Alice to ground zero and she senses magic. Oracle has Black Alice concentrate and see if she can lock on to the Arcane trail. She does and for a moment is seen wearing the hockey Jersey of the team from <a href=\"/platinum-flatts/34-55720/\">Platinum Flats</a>. Misfit barges in upset and picks a fight with Alice. Black Alice steals her abilities and starts beating on her. Oracle uses a sonic gun to get them to stop. Misfit tackles Alice when she threatens Oracle then without her powers she wails on Black Alice. Alice leaves and Misfit's powers return. Oracle asks her if she knew her powers were magic based which she did not. Babs decides to go to Platinum Flats to track down the maker of the truck weapon. While on a stakeout in Platinum Flats Manhunter is engaged by a few metahumans. Worried for her safety Oracle sends Misfit to help.

Manhunter is emotionally messed up because of what the Visionary did to her mind and has forgotten the last two weeks. Once back Oracle apologizes for the way she acted towards everyone. She wants to find the constructors of that weapon and announces her plans to build a new headquarters in Platinum Flats. She moving and wants them to come with her. The man who created the machine using magic is resting when a purple cloud of dark magic opens up in his room.

        "description":"<h2>Team History<br /></h2><p>The V-Battalion is a clandestine organization whose purpose is to covertly monitor the world and thwart any threat to world peace. The V-Battalion is led by a group of advisors known as the Penance Council, which in turn takes its direction from a single leader. The current leader of the Penance Council and, by extension, the V-Battalion, is Jim Hammond, an android formerly known as the World War II hero called the Human Torch. The lead field agent of the V-Battalion is Citizen V. The V-Battalion began during World War II as an organization of European civilians led by the first Citizen V. The V-Battalion, the V standing for Victory, thwarted many Axis advances, but the organization was ultimately dissolved when the Nazi villain Baron Heinrich Zemo led Citizen V and the Battalion into a trap, where he killed the hero with his bare hands. Zemo even took it upon himself to track down and kill many of the Battalion members. Years later, the V-Battalion was revived by Roger Aubrey, the Destroyer, driven by the death of his friend, Brian Falsworth, the second Union Jack. The two, with Union Jacks sister Spitfire, had at times teamed with the Wild Pack to hunt down escaped Nazi war criminals, and Aubrey was determined to continue that mission. He also gathered around him fellow ex-World War II heroes to create the first Penance Council. The V-Battalion became a clandestine group working to apprehend escaped Nazi war criminals, but often the former criminals would be allowed to join the V-Battalion, in such capacities as on-staff scientists, to work for the cause of world peace rather than face public retribution. Over time, as the numbers of Nazi war criminals decreased, the V-Battalion became the watchdog organization it is today, working to make sure that any who would claim to take over the world and manipulate it never succeed.<br /></p><p>Paulette Brazee, a French resistance agent and Citizen Vs lover during the war, became the V-Battalions chief operative as the new Citizen V, and their son later replaced her. Currently, Brazees grandson, John Watkins III, works in the role of Citizen V. Aubrey had established the Battalions headquarters in the Masada Castle of the Balkan nation of Symkaria, maintaining close ties with that countrys Wild Pack. While still primarily based in Masada, Symkaria, the Battalion later found and reverse-engineered an alien spacecraft to serve as their mobile headquarters, named the Vanguard. At one point, Baron Helmut Zemo, the son of Heinrich Zemo, adopted the heroic identity of Citizen V in order lead a team of villains posing as heroes, the Thunderbolts. (At the time, the true Citizen V was in a coma under unrevealed circumstances. It is not known to what extent Zemo was aware of the true Citizen Vs activities and situation.) Zemo later abandoned the guise when it had served its purpose to allow him to nearly succeed in taking over the world. Dallas Riordan, former New York mayoral liaison to the Thunderbolts, was soon approached by the V-Battalion and was told that she was the descendant of the World War II hero. In order to redeem the memory of her ancestor and to bring the Thunderbolts to justice, Riordan agreed to become the next Citizen V on behalf of the V Battalion. As Citizen V, Riordan used a padded costume to appear to be male, claiming to be the true grandson of the original hero, although she later redesigned the costume after an encounter with Captain America convinced her otherwise.<br /></p><p>Later, when the V-Battalion determined that U.S. government commissioner Henry Peter Gyrich was planning on killing superhumans of all kinds, Aubrey ordered Riordan to assassinate Gyrich. Refusing, Riordan fled the V-Battalion, believing that her orders contradicted everything she was taught to believe. She was then considered a rogue agent and other agents were dispatched to kill her so that the mantle of Citizen V could be passed on to someone worthy. She eventually managed to make her way to the Thunderbolts, who had since become heroes in their own right, with the full force of the V-Battalion on her heels. Riordan demanded the Thunderbolts' help, revealing her true identity to them. However, before any conclusion to the battle could be reached, Riordan was again kidnapped by the Crimson Cowl, and the V-Battalion left the Thunderbolts. The Thunderbolts originally tried to track Riordan by following the V-Battalion back to Europe with the help of the Sandman. They failed to find their friend but uncovered the truth of the Battalions organization as the Penance Council teamed up with the Thunderbolts to defeat the Sandman. Henry Peter Gyrich continued his plans for killing superhumans of all kinds, creating an elaborate conspiracy that involved turning Nomad into the hero-killing Scourge. Best-selling author and psychiatrist Andrea Sterman stumbled onto the plot by following a circuitous route, and the V-Battalion kidnapped her, taking her to the Vanguard to protect her. However, once the affair came to a head, with Gyrich being exposed as a pawn of the terrorist organization Hydra, it was decided that Sterman knew too much of the Battalion to be let go, and she was granted a post as observer of the Penance Council.<br /></p><p>During this time, Baron Zemo was killed by Nomad (as Scourge,) but did not truly die. Due to a failsafe device engineered by his robotic associate Techno, Zemo's consciousness was transferred, thanks to Technos perverse sense of humor, into the comatose body of the true Citizen V. Zemo pretended to be the revived Citizen V and assumed the heros role as the leading agent of the V-Battalion, a role which allowed him to defeat Baron Strucker and Hydras plans for the mind-controlling technology used against Gyrich. For a time, Zemo, as Citizen V, was offered leadership over the Redeemers, team of super-agents organized by Gyrichs Commission on Superhuman Activities. (Presumably, the V-Battalion remained unaware of Zemos existence until the current Citizen V reasserted his consciousness when Zemo was shunted to an alternate world.) Once, the Vanguards technology and engines began distorting, threatening to suck the Earth into the null space of a white hole. Citizen V sought the help of the Thunderbolts, and the two groups ultimately plugged the void and shunted its counterpart, an alien ship from Counter-Earth, into space. In the process Baron Zemo and other Thunderbolts believed to have been lost in another world, were returned to Earth. Citizen V hoped to bring Zemo to justice, but Zemo pointed out that he was already legally dead, and the V-Battalion was forced to part company.<br /></p><p>More recently, the Flag-Smasher led ULTIMATUM in coordinated attacks in a dozen different civil war-torn countries around the world. Their aim was to exploit such destabilized countries in their name of a one-world government. In the country of Rumekistan, the Flag-Smasher was confronted by the V-Battalion and Citizen V, who convinced the Flag-Smasher that he should not be forcing his ideas on others but should achieve them through generations of a concerted social agenda. With the Flag-Smashers agreement to cease all hostilities, the V-Battalion used their high-tech weapons to cause Rumekistans army to fall asleep, allowing the Flag-Smasher to quickly and bloodlessly take control of the country. The Flag-Smasher set himself as ruler, hoping this would be the first step towards his dream of global harmony.<br /></p><p>When the V-Battalion investigated ULTIMATUM, they discovered their arms dealer to be Oracle, Inc., a company formerly run by Jim Hammond. Aubrey, despite his personal feelings regarding some undisclosed conflict between them, asked Hammond to join the V-Battalion while they investigated. Ultimately, the organization discovered the new CEO of Oracle and financier of ULTIMATUM to be Marduk, an ancient Sumerian god trapped in a human form for millennia. Marduk hoped to cause massive loss of life and absorb the souls of the fallen combatants. In fact, due to a previous contact with Roger Aubrey, Marduk remotely took the soul of Aubrey, effectively killing him. Citizen V soon confronted Marduk and defeated him, releasing the souls he had stolen, reviving Aubrey. Aubrey then decided to retire from active duty, declaring that if he could not even find peace in death, he would try to find it in a new life. He named Hammond his replacement as he stepped down. In recent years, the Red Skull, posing as US Secretary of Defense Dell Rusk, tricked the Thin Man into organizing a new team of Invaders against the Axis Mundi, a Neo-Nazi organization. The Thin Man constructed the battleship the Infiltrator to oppose them, unaware that the Red Skull intended to steal it to equip the Axis Mundi. They conquered the nation of Mazikhandar before realizing their error but retained control of the Infiltrator. The Thin Man maintained contact with other WWII era heroes such as Blue Diamond, Nomad, Red Raven, and the Vision (Arkus). Eventually it was revealed that the new android member Tara, was in fact a Trojan horse member of the Axis Mundi, unbeknownst even to her. In the resulting incident Hammon sacrificed his life to save the others, and the Thin Man drove the Infiltrator into a dimensional rift to finally destroy the machinations that the Red Skull as Rusk had enacted.</p>",

Krona was rendered helpless and banished from our universe, and the Oans sought effective ways of combating evil. &nbsp;As their numbers were small, no matter how vast their power, they decided to act through agents.</p> <p>Most of the Oans felt the best method was to work through mortal societies, and thus developed robots known as <a href=\"/the-manhunters/65-55857/\">Manhunters</a>, which were later replaced by living agents called <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lanterns</a>. &nbsp;These Oans became the Guardians of the Universe and kept their base of operations on Oa.</p> <p>Another group disagreed, believing that evil was an infection the Oans had let loose, and if it became sufficiently serious, it had to be destroyed. &nbsp;When they failed to convince their fellows of this philosophy, they departed Oa to another dimension. &nbsp;There they developed weapons of awesome power and assigned one to each group. &nbsp;Each member would watch over a specific segment of the multiple universes, and if evil got out of control anywhere, would destroy the affected galaxy. &nbsp;They took the name Controllers.</p> <p>The Controllers then attempted to creaqte a police force of their own in answer to the Guardians' Green Lantern Corps. &nbsp;Their first creation, the Darkstars, were active for quite some time. &nbsp;Though they never gained as much prominence as the Lantern Corps, after their destruction their numbers swelled. &nbsp;In the end the Darkstars were disbanded. &nbsp;The Controller's then created Effigy, in a second attempt at creating a paramilitary force of their own. &nbsp;Sadly, Effigy (and the <a href=\"/effigy-corps/65-22832/\">Effigy Corps</a>) was unstable, and the Controllers abandoned the pursuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"333272\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/333272-198788-the-controllers_super.jpg\" title=\"To control the orange light\"><img id=\"333272\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/333272-198788-the-controllers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"To control the orange light\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">To control the orange light</div></div></div></div><h3><u> <b>The Orange Light of Avarice</b></u></h3>Much like the <a href=\"/zamarons/65-39176/\">Zamarons</a>, the Controllers decided to follow the Guardians' example and harness a portion of the <a href=\"/emotional-spectrum/12-49955/\">Emotional Spectrum</a> to power a corp of their own. &nbsp;What portion mattered little to them. &nbsp;All that mattered was that they would be able to control and use it for their purposes. &nbsp;They discovered traces of the Orange Light of Avarice and sought it out. They tracked it to the <a href=\"/vega-system/34-55817/\">Vega System</a> in Sector 2828, specifically to a planet called Okaara.<br /><br />Upon Okaara, they discovered a jungle overrun and being consumed by weeds, which were apparently being driven by the power source they sought. &nbsp;They followed the trail down into an underground palace, where an orange power battery rested. &nbsp;Whatever creature possessed it, the Controllers were certain they were superior and could wrest control over the orange light. &nbsp;They were mistaken. &nbsp;When one Controller attempted to take the battery, the creature known as <a href=\"/agent-orange/29-58504/\">Larfleeze</a> dispatched his <a href=\"/orange-lantern-corps/65-50745/\">Orange Lanterns</a> and consumed the Controllers with ease. &nbsp;The Controllers who were consumed by the Orange Light have apparently become Larfleeze's Orange Lanterns.<br /><br /><h2>30th Century History</h2>In the latter half of the 30th Century, one Controller decided to use his power to conquer his assigned territory, and unleashed a sun eater,which was his weapon. &nbsp;The Sun Eater menaced Earth and was defeated by the Legion of Super Heroes at the cost of Ferro lad's life. &nbsp;The Legionnaires also confronted the Controller who died of an apparent heart attack that may or may not have been caused by the presence of Ferro Lad's ghost. &nbsp;The Legion was rewarded for their intervention by other Controllers who gave them a \"Miracle Machine\" that could create matter from thought and that later saved the Earth from invasion before being destroyed by Matter Eater Lad.",

In their society, they have a notable gender schism, resulting in two separate groups; the Brotherhood of Badoon (ruled by a ' <a href=\"/brother-royal/29-22908/\">Brother Royal</a>') and the <a href=\"/sisterhood-of-badoon/65-56685/\">Sisterhood of Badoon</a> (ruled by a Queen). The Brotherhood live on the planet <a href=\"/moord/34-57357/\">Moord</a>, while the Sisterhood live on the Badoon homeworld of Lotiara, roughly 42.2 light years from Earth.</p><p>There has been a long hatred between the two genders of the Badoon, and they once fought each other in long wars. As time passed, the males won, placing the females in captivity. Eventually the males developed technology and abandoned Lotiara, and only returned to mate. The males became conquerors of worlds, while the females became pacifists, content to remain in peace on their homeworld and ignorant of the males' star-spanning empire. The Badoon are also much older than the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a> and the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a>, as well.</p><p>The Brotherhood of the Badoon once came to Earth to attempt to enslave the population. They cloaked their ship invisible and investigated the planet. They found that it would be easily defeated. But they soon met with the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> who was trapped on Earth. They tried to deceive him and tell him they were there to share technology with the humans. When a woman escaped their clutches however, she informed the Surfer of their plans. The Badoon waged war on the Surfer but he overpowered them and their <a href=\"/monster-of-badoon/29-59376/\">Monster</a>, and sent them from the planet.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1080516\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/1080516-monster_of_badoon_super.jpg\" title=\"Monster of Badoon\"><img id=\"1080516\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/1080516-monster_of_badoon_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Monster of Badoon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Monster of Badoon</div></div></div></div><p>The Badoon allied with the Kree in the Second <a href=\"/kree-skrull-war/39-55742/\">Kree-Skrull War</a>. The Silver Surfer was tricked into destroying many of their ships by the Skrulls, thus making the Kree his enemies in the war. They used their invisibility to sneak on the Skrull homeworld of Satriani. They had planned to start with the Skrulls and once they were all gone they would turn against the Kree. Each Badoon warrior was equipped with what they call a frag-thong. It explodes when the warrior is killed to kill any enemy warrior in the surroundings. After the battle, it appeared as though all those on the planet were destroyed.<br /><br />The Brotherhood of the Badoon also have a hatred for all life that are not of their own race. They design weapons for war, including the <a href=\"/zoms/29-47164/\">Zoms</a>, which are made from their victims, and enhanced upon the design of their Monster. They test their weapons on live victims, usually peaceful planets. They were recently defeated during such a weapons test by the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-691</h3><p>The Badoon of this reality completely decimated the populations of the residents of the solar system, including <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a>, <a href=\"/mercury/34-56298/\">Mercury</a>, <a href=\"/jupiter/34-55802/\">Jupiter</a>, <a href=\"/pluto/34-56297/\">Pluto</a> and the neighboring star system of Alpha Centauri. Having conquered the system, only the supergroup the Guardians of the Galaxy were able to stand up to them. After seven years of rule, they were defeated with the assistance of the Sisterhood of the Badoon.</p><p>The Badoon were not all captured and continued their manipulations, introducing the people of Earth to Realitee-Vee, a drug-like program that caused the citizens of Earth to become dependent on the device, thus making it easier for the Badoon to again conquer them. In order to keep those who would rebel against them near the facility supporting the device, they enlisted the help of the Earth group the <a href=\"/punishers/65-56118/\">Punishers</a>. This plot was foiled by the <a href=\"/commandeers/65-56388/\">Commandeers</a> with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><h3>The Fault</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"861636\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/861636-gargal016013scol_super.jpg\" title=\"Celestial Engine\"><img id=\"861636\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/861636-gargal016013scol_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Celestial Engine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Celestial Engine</div></div></div></div><p>In an alternate future in which the <a href=\"/the-fault/34-56597/\">Fault</a> expands to destroy most of the universe, the Badoon have successfully killed all other races and even enslaved the <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a>, using their power to keep the Fault from consuming their area of space.

Hugh was a prison guard at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-vault/34-43582/\">             Vault</a>, a prison for super powered criminals, when he was suffocated by Venom's living costume in Venom's attempt to escape.</p>\n<p>Orwell gathered together Hugh's friends consisting of his fellow co-worker and friend&nbsp;Curtis Elkins&nbsp;(<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-18440/\">             Sentry</a>), Samuel Caulkin (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ramshot/29-11214/\">             Ramshot</a>), an army buddy of Hugh's and Hugh's younger brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/screech/29-16207/\">             Maxwell Taylor (Screech). </a>He also recruited two others worked with Hugh at the Vault, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firearm/29-11212/\">             (Firearm)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bomblast/29-11213/\">             (Bomblast).</a> Orwell gave the five of them costumes that were based on the Vault's Guardsman armors (a design stolen from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">             Anthony Stark </a>aka Iron Man). The suits were outfitted with sonics and fire, both of which are anathema to Venom.</p>\n<p>The team's first mission was an attempt to destroy Venom but it failed.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /></p><h2>Creation<br /></h2>The Jury was created by <a href=\"../../david-michelinie/26-40650/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"/david-michelinie/26-40650/\">    David Michelinie</a> and <a href=\"../../mark-bagley/26-2123/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"/mark-bagley/26-2123/\">    Mark Bagley</a> in 1993 and first appeared in <a href=\"../../venom-lethal-protector/49-5059/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> </a><a href=\"/venom-lethal-protector/49-5059/\">    Venom: Lethal Protector</a><a href=\"/venom-lethal-protector/49-5059/\"> </a># 2.&nbsp; <br /><h2>Story Arcs<br /></h2><p>Later, they legally rented spots on multiple New York City rooftops and used sensory equipment to scan for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">             Spider-Man</a>. This did not meet with the expected success because there are multiple superheroes that operate high above the city streets. Spiderman figured out their plan and manages to ambush one of the Jury's maintenance men. The man stands up to Spider-Man, encouraging the superhero to take him to the police, as the equipment is all legal.</p>\n<p>Unsure what to do about the entire situation, Spider-Man intentionally baits one of the sensors, drawing the entire team out into a fight. Sentry was unsure about kidnapping Spider-Man and was ordered back to base. Spider-Man was defeated by the remaining members. He was drugged and tried for his part in originally bringing the Venom symbiote to earth.</p>\n<p>Witnesses were present to testify about Venom's crimes. One was a woman whose child had been traumatized after witnessing Venom's monstrous form (Venom had been trying to protect the girl from what he thought was a dangerous stranger). This trial was part of a plan designed to guilt Spider-Man into helping them steal a government designed weapon capable of slaying Venom.</p>\n<h3>Paranoia</h3>&nbsp;<br />\n<p>Orwell seemed to lose sight of his original goals and began making shady deals with the Life Foundation (of which he was a shareholder) thus relegating the Jury to bodyguards for the foundation's clientele in their bunkers. Orwell began to become paranoid that his team was against him. Orwell eventually abandoned his team to die at the hands of a mutated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carlton-drake/29-55965/\">             Carlton Drake</a>. Orwell Taylor and <a href=\"/roland-treece/29-15957/\">   Roland Treece</a> were later arrested by federal agents after trying to flee the Life Foundation.</p>\n<p>Eventually the Jury breaks from Orwell and reinvent themselves. Orwell's eldest son Maxwell gives up his Screech identity and chose to redesign the Jury and set himself up as the defense lawyer in the Jury's trial of criminals. A mysterious hooded man named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gavel/29-11211/\">             Gavel&nbsp;</a>is assigned to be the judge for all their trials. Gavel was not an actual member of the Jury. He only served to deliver the verdict and always via a transmission from a secret location. A lawyer named&nbsp;Olivia Lentz&nbsp;was recruited to serve as the prosecutor for their trials. Finally the Jury recruited Jennifer Stewart, a former Guardsman whose husband Ryan was killed during a riot at the Vault. Stewart took the codename Wysper and took Screech's place in the team. At this time the Jury operated out of a secret location outside of the United States. They also had a base in southern California located in the office of a&nbsp;shell company&nbsp;named Equity Inc. which supposedly made office furniture. The Jury used a flying ship called the Justifier. Their briefing room was called \"The Box\".</p>\n<p>Shortly after recruiting Wysper the Jury invaded the small country of Boca Del Dios and freed Luis Alvarez the second&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarantula/29-1528/\">             Tarantula</a> from a prison guarded by robotic <a href=\"/the-dreadnaughts/65-55833/\">  Dreadnaughts</a>. The Jury tried <a href=\"/tarantula/29-1528/\"> Tarantula</a> and after presenting testimony he was convicted. The Tarantula tried to escape and was told by Gavel that if he killed Wysper he would be free to go. Tarantula and Wysper battled, Wysper was unsure she could kill Tarantula until she was informed by Gavel that Tarantula was the one who murdered her husband Ryan during the riot at the vault. Wysper snaps Tarantula's neck and was officially made a member of the Jury.&nbsp;<br />Hybrid</p>\n<p>The Jury later tracked down Scott Washington aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hybrid/29-24129/\">             Hybrid</a>, a former Guardsman who was bonded to a symbiote that was in fact a gestalt of four of the five symbiotes who were once culled from the seed of Venom by the Life Foundation. The Jury fails to kill Hybrid due to the intervention of Hybrid's friends the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">             New Warriors</a>. After a fight that both sides confessed got out of hand, all present are convinced that Scott can control the symbiote; he had used pleasant memories of his times with his old Vault colleagues to calm the entity.</p>\n<p>Later the Jury lost their funding and hit hard times. They were forced to be hired goons yet again but this time working for<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/edwin-cord/29-10377/\">              Edwin Cord</a>, a business rival of Anthony Stark aka Iron Man. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/usagent/29-14992/\">             U.S. Agent</a> was made their leader. The Jury was sent after the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">             Thunderbolts</a>&nbsp;who had recently been revealed to be the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/masters-of-evil/65-7582/\">             Masters of Evil</a>. The Jury was defeated by the Thunderbolts and their new leader <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clint-barton/29-1475/\">             Hawkeye</a>. Weeks later The Jury was ordered not to go into battle with Graviton and the Thunderbolts by Edwin Cord who had no desire to waste his resources in battles in which he had nothing to gain personally. The U.S. Agent and the Jury would sometime later go against Cord's mandate and they help the Thunderbolts fight the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-empire/65-15136/\">             Secret Empire</a>.</p>\n<p><br />Recently the Jury fought the New Thunderbolts.

        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>The Circus of Crime was first led by Maynard Tiboldt. It was called Tiboldt's Circus at first since it was managed by generations of the Tiboldt family. During the 1930's, Fritz Tiboldt, who was a Nazi party activist, sent his circus from Germany to America supposedly to give performances. Fritz Tiboldt, who was also known as the ringmaster of death, as well as the rest of their circus, was captured by Captain America as they attempted to assassinate several important government figures.</p><p>Soon after the death of Fritz and his wife Lola, their son Maynard Tiboldt took the mantle of Ringmaster. With a general decline of income as well as his hatred for Americans, he turned to crime. He decided that if they did not want to pay him, he will make them pay. Several members of the circus quit as they did not want to turn to a life of crime but a surprising huge remainder stayed and agreed to the plans. The circus of crime had also fought Spider-man and Daredevil. The Ringmaster had put up posters saying that Spiderman would come to the act and that all proceeds would go to charity so that they would attract a big audience, though he never really suspected spider-man would show up. His plan was to hypnotize the entire audience with his hat and to steal their wallets and watches etc ... Coincidentally, Daredevil, as Matt Murdock, was in the audience. Spiderman did appear and did some tricks but the Ringmaster had managed to hypnotize the entire audience, including Spiderman. Daredevil was left unhypnotized because he was blind. He went after the Ringmaster, but he sent Spiderman to battle for him. Daredevil managed to get the hat away from the Ringmaster and freed Spiderman from his trance. Then the two of them beat down on the entire circus and then beat the Ringmaster. They freed the rest of the audience and caught the Ringmaster.</p><p>The Ringmaster would always use a hidden mind control device implanted in his hat that would set them in a trance as the rest of them robbed them of their valuables. The circus of crime have been arrested many of times but for short periods since it was difficult to pin anything on them since their victims would remember nothing.</p>",

With <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> becoming one of the deceased heroes, Baron Zemo felt that his goals for revenge were pointless and the obsession over Captain America\u2019s death was what destroyed his father. Shifting his goals from vengeance to power, Zemo decided to rule the world by gaining world trust as heroes. With the assistance of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fixer/29-3282/\">Fixer</a>, Zemo and the Masters altered their appearance and posed as the heroic Thunderbolts. With the public unaware that the Thunderbolts were in fact villains, Zemo and the Masters managed to perform well as heroes as they found themselves battling <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arnim-zola/29-14876/\">Arnim-Zola</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rat-pack/65-43835/\">Rat Pack</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/enclave/65-55702/\">Enclave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mad-thinker/29-2131/\">Mad Thinker</a>, a new team of Masters of Evil that was led by a mysterious Crimson Cowl and even former Masters known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a>. To increase their status as heroes, Zemo recruited their first member known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jolt/29-3284/\">Jolt</a> during one of their missions. Even though Zemo purposely disliked having her on the team because of her purposes for publicity for the team, she found herself becoming an influence among the members as hero which slowly began to have the others develop an interest in their heroic roles. Atlas would later develop a relationship with the mayoral aide known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dallas-riordan/29-4826/\">Dallas Riordan</a>, this only set Zemo further into his goals seeing how he had access towards certain information through Riordan. When the Thunderbolts found themselves fighting against the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elements-of-doom/65-55855/\">Elements of Doom</a>, they managed to struggle a victory but at the cost of Fixer dying and forcing his conscious into a robotic body. With the Thunderbolts reputation finding itself growing to where Zemo had gained security access, files, and reached a status compared to the Avengers among the public, some of the members of the Masters began have a change of thought towards Zemo\u2019s goals for world domination. Taking notice of this, Zemo decided to act fast by using equipment from the Enclave to have almost the entire world under his command. During this time Zemo revealed himself and his team to the public their true identities as the Masters of Evil, doing this for the reasons of ensuring absolute loyalty from his team. Even though the Thunderbolts were forced into following Zemo\u2019s goals, nearly all of the Thunderbolts still turned against Zemo as they were force into fighting against Zemo, Fixer, Fantastic Four, and the Avengers for which both teams were mind controlled by Zemo. Yet the Thunderbolts still managed to overcome Zemo\u2019s attacks and foil his plans of world conquest, even though Zemo was badly defeated, he managed to escape with the assistance of Atlas who was repaying his debt to Zemo. After Zemo\u2019s defeat and with the world saved, the remaining Masters found themselves struggling to rebuild their heroic reputation and still continuing their membership as Thunderbolts as wanted criminals. As for what began as a hoax and a plan for world domination from one of the greatest threats towards the Avengers, it would take a handful of the most dangerous criminals to realize that pursuing a goal as a hero was their true calling and despite the damage that Zemo has done for the Thunderbolts, those who remained loyal to their heroic lifestyle managed to turn what was to be known as a hoax into one of the greatest and interesting teams with the Marvel Universe.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The team was created by Kurt Busiek and Mark Bagley, but first appeared in a Peter David's Hulk #449, drawn by Mike Deodato. Kurt Busiek supposedly chose the Thunderbolts slogan from a Roy Thomas Captain Marvel story. \"Justice, like lightning, ever should appear to few men's ruin, but to all men's fear.\"</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The team known as the Thunderbolts was nothing more than a mere fabrication of Baron Zemo\u2019s master plan for world domination, however the team known as Thunderbolts found themselves not only acting as heroes, not only defining themselves as being heroes, but showing the true meaning of hope and second chances for those who decided to take the wrong path. Not only has Thunderbolts has taken a new look for the Marvel Universe, but has been one of the most successful team within the Marvel Universe. Even though the team took a suffering blow when Norman Osborn took full control of the team and publicly disbanded them just so he could remake a new roster for his own purposes that shouldn\u2019t be known throughout public. Even with Normans downfall and the Thunderbolts was thought to be gone, the team was remade with the belief of turning the worst within the Marvel Universe into something good.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Outlaw Adventurers</h3><p>Zemo\u2019s attack on the Thunderbolts found itself starting one of the teams most difficult and struggling challenges. No longer accepted by the public and any other villains who were once allies, the remaining Thunderbolts were forced into becoming outlawed adventurers. As Moonstone proclaimed herself leader, the Thunderbolts found themselves taking menial jobs and continuing to pursuit their career\u2019s as heroes and regain public trust that they once had. Even under Moonstones leadership the Thunderbolts didn\u2019t fair any better because of the lack of trust they had with her and with each other. After managing to elude capture from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> that was led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gw-bridge/29-15062/\">GW Bridge</a>, a group of amateur costumed heroes known as the Lightening Rods offered their assistance on helping Bridge capture the Thunderbolts. As the Thunderbolts found themselves eluding Bridge once again, they next found themselves led into a fight against the Lightening Rods. Even though both teams fought each other for a great amount of time, the Thunderbolts managed to gain victory over the Lightening Rods and use their costumes to escape Bridge\u2019s SHIELD unit once again. Elsewhere, Baron Zemo found himself being stalked by a new Citizen V, who was actually <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dallas-riordan/29-4826/\">Dallas Riordan</a> in disguise. Originally after the Thunderbolts were exposed as criminals, Dallas lost her political career because of her ties with them and later was recruited by a secret organization known as V-Battalion because of her heritage being related to the original Citizen-V. Recruiting and giving Dallas the Citizen-V mantle, she set off on a quest to gain vengeance against Zemo and the remaining Thunderbolts for ruining her life and the Citizen-V legacy. Even though Zemo managed to avoid both Dallas and Captain America who was also searching for Zemo, he managed to locate a signal from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/graviton/29-13347/\">Graviton</a> who was trapped in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/microverse/34-43832/\">Microverse</a> and sought to release Graviton as a means for revenge against the Thunderbolts. Designing a robot that resembled the Hulk that could provide enough energy to release Graviton, Zemo sent the robot to attack the Thunderbolts who were still fleeing from SHIELD. As the Thunderbolts fought against the Hulk robot, the interfering Lightening Rods managed to give Graviton enough energy to escape the Microverse and returned to Earth. Easily defeating both teams, it would take Moonstone to convince Graviton that his attack was meaningless, which caused him to withdraw and leave both defeated teams.</p><h3>Charcoal</h3><p>After halting Graviton\u2019s attack, matters would turn for the worst when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson-cowl/29-22613/\">Crimson Cowl</a> and her formed team of Masters of Evil approached the Thunderbolts. Originally both Thunderbolts and this version of the Masters fought each other under Zemo\u2019s command, yet this time Crimson Cowl decided to make the offer of recruiting the Thunderbolts into her Masters as well gaining the benefits and pay because of their criminal history. Influenced by Crimson\u2019s offer, she gave them time to think of their decision on whether they would want to continue as wanted heroes or return to their ways as members for the Masters of Evil. During this time they still continued on with their heroic ways when investigating disappearances in a small Colorado town known as Burton Canyon. Upon investigation they found that the mutated enforcer known as Charcoal, who was under the orders given by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-empire/65-15136/\">Secret Empire</a> to collect people for experimentation, was menacing the town. Even though Charcoal battled and was defeated by the Thunderbolts, he found himself inspired by the team and their display of heroism.</p><h3>A Second Chance</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"179998\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7086/179998-88161-hawkeye_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"179998\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7086/179998-88161-hawkeye_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Still deciding on whether they should leave their careers as heroes, the Thunderbolts would finally come to a decision when encountering the veteran Avenger known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a>. Feeling like his stint with the Avengers was proving itself meaningless because of how he currently never resumed any leadership position, Hawkeye would see another opportunity when taking notice of the struggling Thunderbolts that caused him to quit the Avengers so that he could lead another team of his own. Easily relating to the Thunderbolts because of his former criminal past and the struggle\u2019s he went through to obtain his heroic reputation, Hawkeye\u2019s leadership over the Thunderbolts quickly boosted the teams morale and credibility because of his promise of rebuilding the Thunderbolts as heroes and granting them pardon's. Not only did Hawkeye recruit Charcoal after he left the Secret Empire, but also pressured both Charcoal and Jolt to continue their schooling due to the fact they were still teenagers with no educational background. Hawkeye also convinced Abe Jenkins to respectfully turn himself over to authorities for a murder charge so that he and the team could gain respect among the public and the authorities.</p><p>Even though Hawkeye and his team of Thunderbolts still struggled with attacks coming from a vengeful <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/usagent/29-14992/\">U.S.Agent</a> alongside with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-jury/65-22911/\">Jury</a>, and the new Citizen V (Dallas Riordan), Hawkeye also managed to guide the team towards their desired path of heroism when publicly going against Crimson Cowl and her Masters of Evil, which currently found itself formed into a massive army of criminals. With the efforts of Charcoal, the Thunderbolts successfully defeated the Masters of Evil and was respectfully seen as heroes because of their actions.</p><p>After the defeat of the Masters of Evil, the Thunderbolts found themselves on the right track of rebuilding themselves after claiming Crimson Cowls base as their new headquarters. Elsewhere the incarcerated Abner Jenkins was dealing problems of his own at Seagate prison when he became a victimized by occasional assaults from several inmates. Still staying true to his heroic role and serving the remainder of his sentence, Abner successfully prevented a mass escape that was orchestrated by his former employer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justin-hammer/29-10219/\">Justin Hammer</a>. As the Thunderbolts reputation began to climb with Hawkeye\u2019s experience, he managed to lead the Thunderbolts to work together as a successful team of heroes that was becoming comparable to an adopted ranch of the Avengers. Yet Hawkeye found himself at an awkward situation when Songbird shared her romantic interest in him when her boyfriend Abner was still serving his prison term. Even though Hawkeye denied Songbird\u2019s advances because of his respects for Abner, Hawkeye eventually found himself romantically involved with Moonstone. After the Thunderbolts managed to defeat and send Graviton back to the Microverse and also saving Charcoal from the Secret Empire after participating in gladiator like fights, the team began noticing a secret benefactor hidden within their base. They would later find out that the benefactor was the former X-villain known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ogre/29-21998/\">Ogre</a>, who was secretly a resident of Mount Charteris long before Crimson Cowl used it. After Ogre was recruited into the Thunderbolts, he acted as the teams mechanic and tech support which increased the teams status after designing several vehicles and air ships for the team to use.</p><h3>A New Beetle</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"99810\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/99810-187368-beetle_super.jpg\" title=\"Under the orders of the CSA, Abner Jenkins returns to his role as the Beetle so that he could infiltrate Justin Hammer's operation.\"><img id=\"99810\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/99810-187368-beetle_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Under the orders of the CSA, Abner Jenkins returns to his role as the Beetle so that he could infiltrate Justin Hammer's operation.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Under the orders of the CSA, Abner Jenkins returns to his role as the Beetle so that he could infiltrate Justin Hammer's operation.</div></div></div></div><p>Ogre\u2019s participation with the Thunderbolts would find itself cut short when he was secretly abducted and replaced by Techno. Bored from working with Zemo, Techno decided to secretly partake with the Thunderbolts once again as Ogre while the real Ogre was kept in suspended animation. With <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justin-hammer/29-10219/\">Justin Hammer\u2019s</a> recent attempt to cause a mass escape from Seagate Prison capturing the attention of Commission on Superhuman Activities (CSA), they would illegally think of a strategy of using Abner Jenkins to infiltrate Hammer\u2019s operation and help the CSA steal an item known as Omega-32. Not only did the CSA freed Jenkins from prison, but also supplied him with a new, fully armored Mark IV Beetle suit. As Abner found himself rebuilding his criminal reputation under the orders of the CSA, he eventually managed to steal the Omega-32 from Hammer and set up a meeting with Hammer at a secluded location. However Abner's former teammates would arrive on the scene that forced Abner into fighting against the Thunderbolts. Eventually Abner would change his thoughts about working with CSA because of his lack of trust for them and would find himself rejoining the Thunderbolts once more. Knowing the Abner\u2019s membership would cause problems with the CSA, Hawkeye not only offered Justine Hammer to Gyrich, but also blackmailed him into releasing Abner from their custody for their illegal use of Abner to obtain the Omega-32. Agreeing to Hawkeye\u2019s terms by ensuring that Abner was no longer wanted from the authorities, he would still be recognized as a convicted felon who was currently serving sentence at Seagate Prison. Because of this, Abner was forced into altering his appearance with not only a new suit of armor, but having Ogre (Techno) alter his facial appearance. However the process was purposely flawed for Techno\u2019s own amusement that caused Abner to take on the appearance of an African American. Because of this, Abner lost his relationship with Songbird, but still became more dedicated to his return to the team and towards Hawkeye for all that he did as a leader.</p><h3>A Rising Threat</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"190461\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/190461-127793-scourge_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"190461\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/190461-127793-scourge_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>With the Thunderbolts successfully reclaiming their position as heroes among the public, a new threat was awaiting them, a threat that first began long before Hawkeye decided to join and lead the Thunderbolts. When joining the Thunderbolts, Hawkeye promised the team that they would be pardoned if he publicly lead them, when in reality this was denied by CSA who also advised and warned Hawkeye\u2019s actions if he ever decided on joining the team of wanted criminals. After the recent incident of blackmailing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Gyrich</a> for Jenkins freedom, Gyrich would react to this by plotting the assassination of each Thunderbolts member. Secretly Gyrich had plans of eliminating all super powered individuals by infecting them with hard air molecules. As a way to test this, Gyrich revived Jack Monroe before infecting him with nanobites so that he would be mentally forced into Gyrich\u2019s control. Possibly inspired from the actions of the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scourge/29-14461/\">Scourge</a> who assassinated a number of costumed criminals, Gyrich had Monroe take up a costumed identity as a new version of the Scourge. Gyrich used Scourge to test the hard air molecules on the Thunderbolts team member Jolt, who Gyrich disliked the most because of her being a possible threat to his goals. As Scourge managed to kill the young Thunderbolt, this event led to the remaining Thunderbolts in a state of shock and mourn that affected Moonstone, Atlas, and Techno the most.</p><p>Gyrich\u2019s actions didn\u2019t go unnoticed when V-Battalion grew suspicious of his activities and discovered his plans of eliminating all super humans around the world. As a response to this, V-Battalion ordered Citizen-V (Dallas Riordan) to assassinate Gyrich. However Dallas felt uneasy with this because of how it wasn\u2019t at all heroic and nothing that Citizen-V stood for. Because of this, Riordan quickly became an enemy for V-Battalion who felt that her role as Citizen-V needed to be replaced. Fleeing from the V-Battalion, Dallas sought shelter from the Thunderbolts after exposing her identity to them to gain trust. As both Thunderbolts and V-Battalion fought each other over Riordan, Crimson Cowl secretly teleported to the scene and kidnapped Dallas. Eventually both V-Battalion and Thunderbolts realized that Dallas was missing, and because of this V-Battalion left the fight with the belief that the Thunderbolts were responsible for Dallas\u2019s successful escape when in reality she was a unwilling pawn for Crimson Cowl\u2019s scheme.</p><p>With V-Battalion leaving the scene and Dallas mysteriously disappeared, the Thunderbolts instantly assumed that V-Battalion were responsible for Dallas\u2019s abduction. After the incident, the Thunderbolts would be offered assistance from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sandman/29-3544/\">Sandman</a> after learning that they were traveling to the country Symkaria. With Sandman and Thunderbolts finally locating V-Battalion, both teams would realize that either team was aware of Dallas\u2019s existence and would be forced into an alliance after Sandman revealed his true goals on traveling to Symkaria, which was to kill Silver Sable. With both Thunderbolts and V-battalion halting Sandman\u2019s attack, Dallas found herself framed for Crimson Cowls crimes before making her escape. Even though Dallas managed to flee from Crimson Cowl, she was seriously injured to where it cost her to lose mobility. Because of her situation, Dallas respectfully turned herself to the authorities to be sentenced for crimes that she never committed.</p><p>Baron Zemo would later meet his fate when Scourge located the criminal mastermind and murdered him under the command of Gyrich. During this time, Techno confiscated Jolt's body and secretly kept her alive because of her genetic powers.</p><h3>The Nefaria Protocols</h3><p>With Zemo and Jolt dead, the Thunderbolts found themselves facing another threat when an ionic powered <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonderman</a> attacked Atlas and kidnapped under mysterious circumstances. They would later discover that the former crime lord of Maggia known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/count-nefaria/29-3229/\">Count Nefaria</a> was seeking ionic powered beings to serve him with his goals on turning the population into ionic beings with an ionic bomb so that he would be able to feed off of their ionic energies. Forcing both Wonderman and Atlas into his services, Count Nefaria would also force his unwilling daughter Madame Masque into participating with his twisted plans for the world. However the combined efforts of the Avengers, the Thunderbolts, and Madame Masque managed to foil Count Nefaria\u2019s plans. But the victory came with a major loss for the Thunderbolts when Atlas absorbed all the ionic energy from ionic bomb that caused his body to be unstable. Because of this, Atlas was forced into stasis until his body was restored to normal.</p><h3>Thunderbolts Last Stand</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"247383\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8876/247383-150783-jolt_super.jpg\" title=\"Jolt after being revived by Techno\"><img id=\"247383\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8876/247383-150783-jolt_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Jolt after being revived by Techno\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Jolt after being revived by Techno</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly after Baron Zemo\u2019s death, Zemo would anticipate his own demise with Techno\u2019s assistance by having his conscious sent to the comatose body of John Watkins III, the heir of the true Citizen-V. Because of this, Zemo was found to be the new Citizen-V and founded the Redeemer\u2019s as a response to CSA\u2019s threat.</p><p>Thunderbolts would later be assaulted by Scourge at their base and would cause the seemingly death of Techno and Atlas who forced himself out of his stasis to halt Scourge\u2019s attacks that resulted with Atlas sacrificing himself in order to prevent his ionic body from destroying the nearby town Burton Canyon. As a last act before being destroyed by Scourge, Techno managed to revive Jolt, who successfully freed Scourge from Gryich\u2019s control by using her powers to disrupt the nanobots within his body. Even though Jack Monroe was restored to normal and Jolt was revived, matters would turn for the worst when Jolt previously learned and revealed Hawkeye\u2019s true intentions for the Thunderbolts and that his promises of having the team pardoned for their crimes was a lie. Because of this, the Thunderbolts were uneasy with Hawkeye for this deception, but the Thunderbolts still remained together when trying to stop Gyrich\u2019s plans of ridding all the superhumans in the world.</p><p>After Techno\u2019s robotic body was destroyed, his conscious was instantly sent to his real body that was kept under stasis and was still recuperating from his previous injuries from his battle with the Elements of Doom. Even though Techno\u2019s real body was functional, he would be forced to wear his tech-pack because of how his spinal cord still wasn\u2019t fully restored. Because of this, Techno was enlisted into Citizen-V\u2019s group known as the Redeemers and together they would make their assault against Gyrich as well.</p><p>With both Thunderbolts and Citizen-V\u2019s (Baron Zemo) Redeemers making their assault on Gyrich, both teams would struggle against Gyrich\u2019s control because of the nanobots and forced into fighting each other. Only Jolt would free both heroic teams and surprisingly Gyrich himself who was also being controlled by nanobots as well. With Gyrich being restored, Hawkeye made another request for the Thunderbolts to be fully pardoned for their crimes. Because of the recent event, Gyrich would accept Hawkeye\u2019s request only if he would turn himself over to the authorities for his acts of vigilantism and that each member of the Thunderbolts would retire from their costume careers. Agreeing to Gyrich\u2019s terms, Hawkeye successfully fulfilled his promise by respectfully turning himself over to the authorities while the Thunderbolts disbanded and went their separate ways to start their civilian lives. With the Thunderbolts gone, Zemo and the Redeemers continued their new heroic career while V-Battalion pursued the true culprit behind CSA\u2019s plans to annihilate all superhumans in the world, who would later be discovered as Baron Strucker.</p><h3>The Redeemers</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"181281\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181281-156198-redeemers_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"181281\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181281-156198-redeemers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>With the Thunderbolts disbanded and Hawkeye respectfully serving his sentence at Seagate Prison, the formed Redeemers acted as replacements for the Thunderbolts that was also government sponsored. Both Charcoal and Jolt continued their heroic careers by joining the Redeemer\u2019s as the new team took over Mount Charteris. The remaining Thunderbolts went their own ways as both Jenkins and Songbird started their new lives as pardoned citizens in Burton Canyon. As Citizen-V (Zemo) attended to pursue the true culprit of the CSA conspiracy alongside with V-Battalion, Captain America volunteered as an advisor and acting leader during Citizen-V\u2019s absence. The Redeemer\u2019s managed to start off on a great as they found themselves saving Counter-Earth, rescuing the injured Dallas Riordan from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Dr Doom\u2019s</a> captivity, and fending off another attack from the Secret Empire. After Citizen-V returned to his role as leader, the Redeemer\u2019s would find themselves facing a greater threat when Fixer found and awoke the powerful mutant known as Humus Sapien. Even though the Redeemers halted Humus Sapiens attack, another threat would arise when a vengeful Graviton would return to Mount Charteris to seek out the Thunderbolts. Only finding the Redeemer\u2019s, Graviton quickly and viciously murdered each member of the Redeemers besides Citizen-V who managed to escape Graviton\u2019s attack and Fixer who offered his allegiance to Graviton out of an act of cowardice. Assisted by Fixer, Moonstone, and an alien P\u2019Tahh assistant from the Micro-verse, Graviton planed to use his powers for world domination.</p><p>Witnessing the incident, both Songbird and Jenkins would be assisted by a seemingly resurrected Atlas (who was sharing a conscious with Dallas Riordan) to form into group to go against Graviton. Eventually, Citizen-V, a revived Jolt, Moonstone, and Fixer who both decided to switch alliance at the last minute would join the trio and form into the Thunderbolts once more to stop Graviton\u2019s attack. Even though the team did manage to stop Graviton and alien invasion from the P\u2019Tahh, besides Songbird and Citizen-V, all the Thunderbolts were believed to be dead in an implosion. Leaving only Songbird as the sole survivor of the incident, she was unaware that the team did manage to survive as they were transported to Counter-Earth. Zemo\u2019s conscious would also be forced out of John Watkins body and residing in Fixer\u2019s Tech-pack, leaving John Watkins to pursue his career as the revived Citizen-V.</p><h3>A Brave New World</h3><p>The Thunderbolts who were presumed deceased would encounter alternate versions of themselves on Counter-Earth. Not only was this version led by a counter-version of Zemo\u2019s deceased father, Hienrich Zemo, but also an alternate version of Helmut Zemo himself who never suffered any full body scars like the Mainstream Zemo did. During this time, Zemo\u2019s conscious would also torment Fixer by tampering with his ability to be mobile, because of this Fixer would send Zemo\u2019s conscious into his Counter-Earth version. Fully restored and having a normal appearance, Zemo would kill his alternate father and form the Thunderbolts once more to fight against a Nazi threat. Residing on the mobile Attilian, Zemo and his team of Thunderbolts were worshiped as both heroes and saviors, but with Zemo restored and leading the team caused uneasy tension with team because of the suspicion for his goals of world domination.</p><h3>THE THUNDERBOLT ARMY</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"136967\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/136967-25633-thunderbolts_super.jpg\" title=\"Zemo And His Team\"><img id=\"136967\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/136967-25633-thunderbolts_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Zemo And His Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zemo And His Team</div></div></div></div><p>The new Thunderbolts engaged and defeated <a href=\"/quicksand/29-25663/\">Quicksand</a> in a battle in during the early days of the superhero <a>Civil War</a>. Most of them showed no care whatsoever towards the <a>Registration Act</a>, since all of their identities were mostly public. After this, they were summoned to where they met with Iron Man, Mister Fantastic and Yellowjacket. The three heroes, all supporting the Superhuman Registration Act, told Zemo and his entire team that they wanted the Thunderbolts to hunt down super villains and recruit them to the Pro-Registration cause, which would be their chance at were all the villains that joined the team during the Civil War. Unknown to Iron Man, the Thunderbolts had been doing this in secret for three weeks. Meanwhile, Reed Richards was working on the new special prison for any villains they managed to catch.</p><p>Zemo's <a href=\"/thunderbolts-army/65-58993/\">Thunderbolt Army</a> grew rapidly, the team vastly expanding because of the villains caught. It now included dozens of other supervillains, including most notably <a>Doctor Octopus</a>, the <a>Wrecker</a>, <a>Green Goblin</a>, <a>Venom</a>, etc. The new team dispersed to battle super-villains, capture them and offer them a choice: join the Thunderbolts or go to prison. It is obvious what almost all of the villains chose, since they wanted to remain free. Baron Zemo convinced Captain America not to stop him from battling the <a>Grandmaster</a>, while Nighthawk was revealed as being a spy for the <a>Squadron Sinister</a> inside <a href=\"/captain-americas-resistance/65-58900/\">Captain America's Resistance</a>. Zemo then informed Songbird that in the coming battle, he knew that she would betray him, which she had been planning to do all along, in revenge for his killing of Photon, and he would sacrifice himself to save the world. Zemo then saved the Wellspring of Power from the Grandmaster, who planned to use it for his own ends. Believing that all of his visions were subject to the flow of time, and that nothing was set in stone, Zemo defeated the Grandmaster, and boasted to his teammates that the power was now all his and theirs. He insisted that he would use it to help the world, despite the consequences for doing so. Songbird, who had temporarily lost her powers during the final battle, was told by Zemo \"... now is when your betrayal would have come.\" The vision of her betrayal turned out to be somewhat correct after all, though. Although she could not use her super-sound, Songbird used a simple opera note to crack the moonstones, sending Zemo into a whirlwind of cosmic time/space. In his final words before he was completely sucked into the vacuum, he screamed out that he would never have hurt a world he worked so hard to save.</p><h3>CIVIL WAR</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"260505\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/260505-78748-thunderbolts_super.jpg\" title=\"Civil War\"><img id=\"260505\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/260505-78748-thunderbolts_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Civil War\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Civil War</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a></p><p>After the Super Human Registration Act became official and Tony Stark was now Director of SHIELD, he decided to remake the Thunderbolts team after Zemo\u2019s seemingly demise. As a unique and risky strategy towards the capture of heroes who were Anti-Registration, Tony Stark agreed to secretly set up a team of villains who were dedicated towards hunting heroes. With the help of Mister Fantastic, each member (besides Songbird) was injected with a nano-chain that entered within the bloodstream. To ensure absolute loyalty and control, if any member chose to disobey or escape custody, by command there would be violent shock throughout the body, and also the shock would find itself being more lethal after the next given shock. Even though Tony approved this team of Thunderbolts, it wouldn\u2019t be himself that would be taking leadership of the team. Even though Songbird was registered, her previous actions haven\u2019t gained any trust among Tony Stark, causing her veteran status to be overlooked and giving the leadership towards somebody else. For reasons kept secret, Tony Stark appointed Norman Osborn as director of the Thunderbolts. Probably one of the least trusted men within the Marvel Universe, Norman possibly gained his position because of his involvement with the assassination attempt on the Atlantis ambassador. Also injected with the same nano-chains as most of his team, Norman\u2019s status was kept under the strict supervision of Tony Stark himself. Even though the Thunderbolts became one of the most famous icons among the citizens, Tony would later realize that his choices for this team would lead towards one of the most darkest chapters within the Marvel Universe.</p><p>At the height of the fight between Pro-registration and Anti-Registration, Tony\u2019s attempt to bring down Steve Rogers and his team took a desperate turn when reinstalling the Thunderbolts. Recruiting former Thunderbolt member Songbird and possibly as the field leader, Stark selected a cast of murderers, psychopaths, and monsters into the team. Kept under strict supervision and each dangerous member injected with nano-chains into their bloodstream, Tony was in full control of this selected and temporarily group. Because of recruiting the likes of these individuals, Punisher found himself joining the Captain America\u2019s group and even killing two of it\u2019s members Jester and Jack O Lantern when they both nearly killed Spiderman. With the remainder of the group joining Tony Stark's fight against Captain Americas team, this team found itself changed and placed under the leadership of Norman Osborn.</p><h3>AMONG MADMEN AND MONSTERS</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"430459\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL_super.jpg\" title=\"Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts\"><img id=\"430459\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/430459-Thunderbolts115-FINAL_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Norman Osborn's Thunderbolts</div></div></div></div><p>With the end of the Civil War the Thunderbolts were given new members and a new director Norman Osborn. The new team included Moonstone, Songbird, Penance, Swordsman, Venom, Radioactive Man, and the secret member Bullseye. Their first assignment was to capture Jack Flag and Moonstone had Radioactive man destroy a number of cars in the area in an attempt to cripple Jack. She then sent in Venom and Swordsman to finish the job, however Jack wasn't out of the fight yet, he shattered Swordsman's sword and kicked the broken piece into Venom. Mac became enraged and was about to eat Jack when Moonstone activated his nano-chain shocking him. She then had Penance use his energy blast to hit Jack. Jack went into a warehouse were Bullseye had stabbed him in his spine which couldn't allow Jack to walk again. After that they were sent to capture Steel Spider, who Norman is constantly mistaking for Spider-Man. It is also revealed that Moonstone wants to be the leader of the Thunderbolts and asks Swordsman to help her with it. Swordsman too shares a grudge against Osborn for not yet cloning his dead sister. When the Thunderbolts go after Steel Spider, American Eagle and Sepulchre.</p><p>They all fought against each other and the Thunderbolts took losses with Moonstone having an arrow shot through her wrist, Swordsman getting tossed into a building, and Penance having a mental breakdown. In the end Venom bit off Steel Spider's arm and ate it. Songbird not wanting to see her team become monsters tried to get rid of everyone, she talked to Bullseye saying that his nano-chain was disabled and he was free. Bullseye killed his handlers and decided to kill American Eagle anyway, when Bullseye fought him he was easily outmatched. Seeing that Bullseye had killed his handlers, Swordsman informed Moonstone, who ordered his nano-chain to activate. Bullseye was paralyzed from a broken neck, by the combination of electric shock and a punch from American Eagle across his head. With the Thunderbolts most valuable member surgery and medical attention and Moonstone temporarily removed as team leader, the remainder of the team still continued their mission on apprehending unregistered heroes and villains. Secretly, four costumed psychics infiltrated the Thunderbolts mountain by surrendering so they could have the chance to destroy the team. Realizing that Penance was highly unstable in the field, Tony Stark sent Doc Samson to evaluate and help Baldwin overcome his guilt. Dislike having Samson in Thunderbolts mountain, Osborn had no choice but to let him evaluate Baldwin. Meanwhile the four psychics held in the holding cells started to mentally control and manipulate the team. Changing Osborn into the Green Goblin, having Venom go on a carnivorous rampage, making Swordsman try to overrun the base, causing Radioactive Man to go insane. Unable to control Samson, the psychics controlled Moonstone to attack Samson and Baldwin which ended with Baldwin smashing Moonstone through the walls. Venom was stabbed and defeated by Swordsman, and Osborn, dressed as the Green Goblin attacked and crucified Swordsman. Osborn went on a killing spree, killing any guards that he could find till he was attacked by Songbird who was trying to stop his murdering rampage. Both Songbird and Osborn fought till both were knocked unconscious. With the team down, it was Bullseye who woke from surgery and saved the team by going to the holding cells and used the psychics as target practice. With the whole incident recorded, Songbird managed to give Samson a copy of it on a DVD after the incident.</p><h3>SECRET INVASION</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"430381\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/430381-ThunderBOLTS_Billy%20Tan125Cover_super.jpg\" title=\"Secret Invasion\"><img id=\"430381\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/430381-ThunderBOLTS_Billy%20Tan125Cover_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Invasion\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Secret Invasion</div></div></div></div><p>A highlight for the Thunderbolts and Norman Osborn came when the Skrulls began an invasion on Earth. Before the attack, Thunderbolts received a visitor and a new member with the team. Andrea Strucker finally returned to her brother and was kept under the supervision of her brother from the guards and Norman Osborn. Norman instantly realized how this came to be when remembering an earlier mission on capturing Armin Zola, the one guy who could manage to clone Andrea. Uncomfortable about having Andrea as a member of the team, Norman eventually accepted her stay with the team. It wouldn\u2019t be later until the invasion found itself crashing through the front steps of Thunderbolts Mountain. An attack by a confused Skrull version of Captain Marvel, this Skrull easily took down the entire team until Norman Osborn managed to convince the Skrull that his attacks on the Thunderbolts was pointless and that his meaning was meant for somewhere else. Managing to save the team, Norman was far from being done with the Skrull invasion after learning that the fight was taking place on the front steps of the White House. Probably the most heroic and display of selfishness, Norman gathered his team and joined the battle with the heroes against the Skrulls. First time ever participating in action, Norman bravely led his team against the Skrulls as they managed to gain the attention of the public. Knowing what his actions would gain, Norman knew that the citizens and the White House would start having more trust with him than Tony Stark and the heroes. As the Thunderbolts continued to defend the White House from the Skrulls, Moonstone found herself attempting to join the Skrulls with Andrea. Believing that Andrea was a Skrull, Moonstone was attacked by her when realizing her traitorous actions. Instantly Bullseye suck up from behind her and killed Andrea, later claiming that it was a Skrull that killed her when Andreas demanded how she died. As the battle grew more intense and the heroes found themselves in an effortless battle against the Queen Skrull, Norman managed to kill the Queen from a blast of his high-powered rifle. As the war was televised and after seeing Tony Stark fleeing from the fight, Normans display of courage, leadership, and success gained the attention of the President. Seeking another man to fulfill the responsibilities that Tony Stark failed to do, Norman Osborn was instantly appointed to replace Tony Stark and his plans for the Thunderbolts led to another dark chapter for some of the members and the creation of two more teams.</p><h3><a>DARK REIGN</a></h3><p>Darkest chapter within Marvel history began when Norman Osborn first took position as the second most powerful man in America. Throughout Osborn's reign, the team of Thunderbolts became something else rather than the meaning of something good for the bad and wicked. Instantly publicly disbanding the team, Norman Osborn sworn to the public that the Thunderbolts was no more. Far from his promise when Norman changed the former team in disguise and reinstalled a new version of Thunderbolts that followed a different meaning. Even though this newest version was under the commend and payroll of Norman Osborn, there was still a sense of villain reforming among the team that eventually led towards the members going against each other. Unlike Osborn's own team of Avengers, this sister team was far from reaching Normans good side as he later realized that most of the missions that they go on naturally ended in failure. Disliking anything inferior, Normans plans and newest recruits for the roster led towards more and more uncomfortable situations among the team. Realizing that siding with Norman Osborn was probably not in their best interest.</p><h3>THUNDERBOLTS DISBANDED</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"477204\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/477204-thunderbolts_cv127c_super.jpg\" title=\"Disbanded\"><img id=\"477204\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/477204-thunderbolts_cv127c_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Disbanded\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Disbanded</div></div></div></div><p>Norman had plans for just about every member within his team of Thunderbolts. Publicly disbanding the Thunderbolts, Norman needed accomplish one last task before setting his plans into motion. Norman knew that half of the team would pose as threat to him or better off avoiding what was bound to happen. Out of respect, Norman managed to have Chen Lu be sent back to his home country as a hero among the nation. Not realizing Normans plans, but suspecting something sinister. Even though Robbie Baldwin fully recovered from his emotional crises, Norman still had Moonstone holding his therapy sessions. Drugged by Moonstone under the orders of Osborn, Penance was taken care of as he quickly found himself ordered into a mental hospital. With Songbird saw her only true friend among the team leave, Chen Lu\u2019s departure was the cue for Bullseye's attack and gain his personal revenge for the incident he suffered from his fight with American Eagle. Managing to escape Bullseye's clutches, both Venom and the psychotic killer chased Songbird throughout Thunderbolts Mountain nearly killing the heroine more than once. With Moonstone supervising the attack and giving away Songbirds whereabouts through the security, Songbird managed to escape Thunderbolts Mountain with one of the carriers. Even though her escape seemed successful, both Venom and Bullseye were on the carrier. As the harrier crashed and Venom was knocked unconscious, Songbird nearly died at the hands of Bullseye before being saved by Andreas who knocked out the killer from behind with a sword blast. Letting Songbird go out of respect, Andreas claimed that it was he who killed Songbird and took care of Normans most hated member of the team.</p><p>Publicly disbanded and with selected members who pose as a possible threat for Norman Osborn taken care of, the remainder of the team found themselves involved with one of the most demoralizing plans for the heroes of the Marvel Universe. Norman needed a team of heroes and to be worshiped among the citizens of America as their savior and hero. One power that Norman had, the people. And his idea for giving the people heroes who wouldn\u2019t fail involved a team of half disguised former Thunderbolts, Marvel Boy, and two of the original members of Tony Stark's Avengers. Bullseye was disguised as Hawkeye, Moonstone took the disguise of Miss Marvel, Daken posing as his father, and Venom taking on the disguise as Spiderman. As for Norman Osborn, realizing that a team of Avengers wouldn\u2019t be final without a Captain America nor an Iron Man, he designed a replicated Iron Man suit with red, white, and blue design, proudly calling himself the Iron Patriot.</p><h3>SECRET TEAM</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"633027\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/633027-thunderbolts_francesco_mattina128_super.jpg\" title=\"Secret Team\"><img id=\"633027\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/633027-thunderbolts_francesco_mattina128_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Secret Team</div></div></div></div><p>With Thunderbolts publicly disbanded and the former roster taking up roles as heroes among Normans team of Avengers, secretly there would be another roster to take the name Thunderbolts. As the second most powerful man in America, Norman needed a team to work under the eye of the people. Basically a team that would accomplish Normans dirty work and illegal missions. Carefully selecting each member of the team, Norman kept Thunderbolts Mountain open and in full operation for his newest team of the Thunderbolts. Even though each member possessed skills, abilities, and something useful towards the missions or situations that Norman had installed for them, it is believed that one of the members was duped into joining the team and dying during one of the missions. Reasons for this was that Norman could take care of two major problems that pose a threat for his current position at once and to rid himself of a useless annoyance. However Normans supposed full-proof plan didn\u2019t go so well for ridding himself of the annoyance and his expression of anger for the team started to grow more and more to where the next failure that this team would be facing was their last. What Norman probably didn\u2019t realize was that half of the team wasn\u2019t fully loyal to his ideas and plans. Only trust that these few Thunderbolts had was each other, even when Norman began recruiting more violent and obsessed killers later on. Later, one of the members within the team would be exposed as an infiltrator among the team, this however was backfired when Norman was fully aware of the infiltrator from the very start. With knowledge about the infiltrator, Norman used this opportunity to capture one of the most difficult men to find, Nick Fury. Another individual who posed as a serious threat towards Normans position. Even though this new team of Thunderbolts displayed utmost teamwork through means of espionage, it was among half of the team members themselves who had little trust for Normans decisions and those other Thunderbolts who blindly followed him and his chaotic ideas that made this version of the Thunderbolts unsuccessful.</p><h3>SIEGE</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1202084\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1202084-tbolts143_int_lr_0002_02_super.jpg\" title=\"Spear of Odin\"><img id=\"1202084\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1202084-tbolts143_int_lr_0002_02_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Spear of Odin\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spear of Odin</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/siege/39-55985/\">Siege</a></p><p>Before Norman Osborn\u2019s invasion for Asgard, not only did he send his team on a special mission to destroy the team known as the Agents of Atlas, but also recruited another costumed villain into the team known as Grizzly. Due to his personal experience with the Agents of Atlas, Osborn felt that Grizzly was both useful and expandable, making a perfect candidate for his team of Thunderbolts. As the team managed to track down the Agents, their mission instantly went wrong as the Agents gained the upper hand. Until the current field leader Scourge managed to save his team and escape. As the mission was unsuccessful, the Thunderbolts were instantly placed onto another mission during Osborn\u2019s attack on Asgard. Sadly, Scourge shot and killed Headsman due to him being brainwashed from the attack on one of the Agents secret bases. Mission given directly from Osborn himself was to retrieve Odin\u2019s staff in one of the treasure rooms within Asgard. As the Thunderbolts managed to obtain the staff, they found themselves going against Hank Pym's team of Avengers. As the fight progressed between the Avengers and half of the Thunderbolts, Paladin and Ant-Man escaping from the scene while Ghost found himself assisting the Avengers on defeating his own team. Even though the remaining the Thunderbolts were defeated and Osborn\u2019s secret team was no more, USAgent was left with a devastating attack by Scourge as he chopped off two of his limbs with the Odin Staff.</p><h3>HEROIC AGE</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1465960\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1465960-78930comic_storystory_full_6996511._super.jpg\" title=\"Heroic Age\"><img id=\"1465960\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1465960-78930comic_storystory_full_6996511._medium.jpg\" alt=\"Heroic Age\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heroic Age</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/the-heroic-age/39-56023/\">The Heroic Age</a></p><p>During the Heroic Age Steve Rogers decided to restart the Thunderbolts program as an opportunity to rehabilitate super-criminals. In order to do this he asked Luke Cage to lead them since he managed to redeem himself and prove himself to be a hero when he was thought to be a dangerous criminal. They will be operating from a tower built into the Raft, the super maximum security prison for dangerous super-villains.</p><p>While the new team listened to a lecture from Luke Cage about how important the team was, outside the Raft, it seems as if Cage suffocates, while a ship appears out of the water, and <a>Baron Zemo</a>, the original leader of the Thunderbolts walks out trying to recruit the members into his own team of Thunderbolts. Some members try to flee, others try to fight Zemo, but the result is that it was just a trick by the <a>Fixer</a>, trying to see who was loyal to the team, and who needed some more help.</p><p>Luke Cage leads the team to the American Midwest, tasked with capturing Trolls escaped from the remains of the Norse Gods' fallen city of Asgard.

Ten minutes after the Academy's arrival, the power shuts down in the raft and three of the students go missing. The team splits up to secure the area and find the children. Songbird goes to the women's quarters, and tries to calm the women down, when the Troll-Girl (<a>Gunna</a> ) from their previous mission, escapes her cell to aid Songbird. After many fights between Luke Cage against <a>Purple Man</a>, <a>John Walker</a> ( The new warden of the Raft ) against male inmates , and Songbird and Gunna against women inmates, the students are found, and the power is restored.</p><p>A couple days later, after a phone call with his wife, Luke Cage talks to <a>Iron Fist</a>, but soon kills him.

Kimbro said that Darris discovered the existence of members of the Hand that have been killed but are still living (the Underhand). Kimbro also says that <a href=\"/shadowland/34-57004/\">Shadowland</a> has an underground fortress where these beings live in a purgatory-like state At the raft, in the mess hall, female inmates are fascinated by Gunna, whom they call Troll. They tell Songbird that Gunna doesn\u2019t understand English, but when they ask Songbird if the rumor that Gunna was a cannibal is true, she stops devouring her meal and says \u201caye\u201d, surprising everyone. On the men\u2019s side, an inmate antagonizes Crossbones thinking his nanites will prevent him from touching other inmates. During their meal, Crossbones grabs his hand, the back of which is discolored, presumably from the exposure to the Terrigen crystals from last issue. On their way out of the mess hall, Juggernaut creates a distraction for Crossbones, who then shoves a plastic spork down the throat of the inmate who was irritating him.</p><p>The team then assembles and transports via Man-Thing to Hell\u2019s Kitchen where they meet with Cage. He takes them to a sewer entrance and gives them their mission: find Darris Kimbro, and if there is an underground fortress, level it. Cage tells the team Fixer is the lead on the mission since Cage has other Shadowland-related business to attend to. The team, Fixer, and Songbird head through the sewers and are eventually attacked by Hand ninjas. During the battle, Fixer is stabbed through the stomach and Songbird is overtaken, leaving the team without handlers, which pleases Moonstone, who is ready to have some fun.With no authority telling them what to do, the the remaining Thunderbolts try to get the job done their way. As Ghost and Crossbones make their way to the prisoners left in the sewers, Crossbones' new power manifest. His new destructive powers kill Darris Kimbro, a cop and also a friend of Cage's, as Ghost secretly witnesses the man's death. Afterwards, the team goes back to the Raft.</p><p>On a routine mission with the Big Three, Steve Rogers, Iron Man and Thor, Ghost along with Crossbones and Juggy concoct an escape plan, that would involve interfering with their teleportation, leading the Thunderbolts and the Avengers into another dimension. The rogue T-Bolts do battle with the Avengers and Luke Cage, while Man-Thing, who was initially used for transportation, lies around. The Avengers come out as victors and Crossbones is off the team, after a failed attempt on Steve Roger's life using his new powers, proving once and for all that Brock Rumlow truly was irredeemable. Juggernaut and Ghost end up complying with the Avengers and Luke Cage, after a brief scuffle and some self reflection on their part.</p><p>The Thunderbolts are grounded after Cage finds out that Crossbones killed his friend Darris Kimbro. As an act to lighten up the mood, Moonstone tries to befriend Ghost, and Ghost in return tells her his origin. As he is done with his story, Mach-V comes in and announces that the Thunderbolts have a new mission.</p><p>The new mission is to stop the monsters from Monsters Island, from attacking Japan. Needing more man-power, Luke Cage brings Hyperion on the team. During the mission, Hyperion shows his true colors, and betrays the team. Juggernaut and Moonstone, with Ghost manage to stop him and beat him up. Man-Thing, who was sliced in half by Hyperion exacts his revenge on the madman by inflicting his acid touch on him. The Thunderbolts also succed on their mission, thus saving Japan.</p><p>With Hyperion off the team, the board behind the Thunderbolts assess Man-Thing's stability and contributions to the team. Jennifer Kale, a sorceress, also a friend of Man-Thing's, decide to bust him out of the Raft and into his home, the swamp. Man-Thing attacks the dimensional intruders who attack the swamp, and transports himself back to the Raft. Jennifer insists that Man-Thing is being used like a machine, but after some solid words from Luke Cage and Songbird, the sorceress leaves her friend with the Thunderbolts. After a good assessment, Man-Thing is able to stay on the team.</p><p>Nonetheless, the board behind the Thunderbolts were displeased with the team's vulnerability to magic, as was displayed by Jennifer Kale's break-in. Luke Cage, seeing reason behind this, decides to recruit a new magic based member for the team. Not knowing where to start, he enlists the help of <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> and <a href=\"/hellstorm/29-14695/\">Daiman Hellstrom</a> ; with the latter suggesting that Luke Cage go find his sister, <a href=\"/satana/29-13783/\">Satana</a>. After a trip through the Himalayan Mountain Range, Luke Cage and Doctor Strange are able to locate and subdue Satana, who was first unwilling to voluntarily join the Thunderbolts but then became humbled by the idea when she realized that she would be working alongside Man-Thing.</p><p>Meanwhile, back at the Raft, warden John Walker is given the approval to gather a second team of Thunderbolts (beta team), whom he appoints Songbird as captain. A number of inmates are chosen as possible candidates for\nthe beta team, some of which include: <a href=\"/blizzard/29-4808/\">Blizzard</a>, a Super-Skrull, <a href=\"/black-mamba/29-30719/\">Black Mamba</a> and\n<a href=\"/scarecrow/29-3239/\">Scarecrow</a>. They are all then processed, via one on one interviews with the heads of the Raft (John Walker, Songbird,\nFixer and Mach-V). Ultimately though, <a href=\"/mr-hyde/29-3233/\">Mister Hyde</a>, <a href=\"/centurius/29-50738/\">Centurius</a>, <a href=\"/shocker/29-4825/\">Shocker</a>, <a href=\"/boomerang/29-6299/\">Boomerang</a> and Gunna\nare the few that make the cut. Before the newly assembled beta team could progress with their teamwork training, Fixer gets an alert message from the U.N requesting the Thunderbolt's assistance in Iraq. With Luke Cage's primary team already on a mission of their own, Fixer sees no choice but to prep the beta team for their first mission under the surveillance of captain Songbird, Mach-V and himself.</p><p>En route to Iraq, the beta team and their captains are met up with Moonstone, Ghost, Man-Thing and Satana, after the primary team's failed mission in trying to stop a German occultist from the First World War. The amassed Thunderbolts engage the enemy, whom turn out to be a horde of zombies resurrected from what was first thought to be magic; although this hypothesis is soon disapproved by Centurius, who concluded that the dead were being reanimated by a combination of an air-borne compound and an energy transmitter. Both sources are destroyed by Mach-V and Moonstone. With the mission accomplished, the Thunderbolts are ready to leave the vicinity, but not before a distress signal from the raft is intercepted by Ghost informing them of a breakout caused by Cain Marko, the Juggernaut.</p><h3>FEAR ITSELF</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/fear-itself/39-56288/\">Fear Itself</a></p><p>The Thunderbolts arrive back on the Raft to find it\ncompletely levelled by the destruction caused by the Juggernaut (who had been\npossessed by a <a href=\"/kuurth-breaker-of-stone/29-79081/\">mystical hammer</a>). In the state of emergency numerous convicts\nhad already escaped, namely Crossbones and the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a>. Those that had\nnot escaped in time were rounded up by the Thunderbolts, in an attempt to\nsecure the area. With no power and contact from Luke, Songbird splits the\nThunderbolts into groups; each appointed with a certain task to restore the\nfacilities on the Raft. The beta team (Centurius, Boomerang, Shocker and Mister\nHyde) make their way towards the medic labs (under the false pretence of\nbringing it back to the courtyards to treat the wounded) where they planned to\nremove their nanites and escape. Upon reaching the medical ward, Centurius has\nthe team re-examine their situation; if they decide to escape then and there,\nthey would be immediately caught by their handlers. With that in mind, the team\nagree that there would be better opportunities to escape in the future and it\nwould be best to play heroes for now (not before Centurius makes it appear as\nthough their nanites are still active).</p><h2>Current Roster</h2><p><a href=\"/songbird/29-3281/\">Songbird</a></p><p><a href=\"/abe-jenkins/29-4822/\">MACH-V</a></p><p><a href=\"/skaar/29-48518/\">Skaar</a></p><p><a href=\"/toxic-doxie/29-74558/\">Toxic Doxie</a></p><p><a href=\"/barney-barton/29-70149/\">Trickshot</a></p><p><a href=\"/ai-apaec/29-74554/\">Ai Apaec</a></p><p><a href=\"/ragnarok/29-47573/\">Ragnarok</a></p><h2>Alternate Universes</h2><h3>Counter-Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"286865\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/286865-101404-thunderbolts_super.jpg\" title=\"Counter-Earth Thunderbolts\"><img id=\"286865\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/286865-101404-thunderbolts_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Counter-Earth Thunderbolts\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Counter-Earth Thunderbolts</div></div></div></div><p>Counter-Earth is not really an alternate reality.

Professor X asked Magneto to take his place as headmaster of Xavier's school. Professor X was then transported to a <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a> ship with <a href=\"/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a> where the Shi'ar's medical technology could save the Professor. The Shi'ar ship was required to return to its own galaxy with no definitive date of the Professor's return. During this time, <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> was revealed to be alive and had never been the <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Phoenix</a>. The Jean Grey who became the Phoenix and died on the moon was a clone created by the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"80322\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/80322-99000-x-factor_super.jpg\" title=\"The Original X-Factor\"><img id=\"80322\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/80322-99000-x-factor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Original X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Original X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>After the trial of Magneto, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> was forced to relinquish his role as team leader of the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> to <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>. Despite the birth of his son, <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Nathan Summers</a>, Cyclops' mistrust and doubts about Magneto distracted him from his personal responsibilities. When the rest of the original X-Men learned about Magneto as headmaster of Xavier's school, all five finally came together to meet especially anxious to see Jean Grey alive as well.</p><p>They did not trust Magneto to lead the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> and had doubts about his story concerning Professor X's whereabouts who may be dead. Since they mistrusted their former arch-nemesis, they created a group consisting of the original X-Men. <a href=\"../../angel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warren Worthington</a> used his company to create the <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> group, where they posed as mutant-hunting humans at the urging of Warren's longtime friend <a href=\"../../cameron-hodge/29-13379/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cameron Hodge</a>. They also posed as human-hating mutants under the alias <a href=\"/x-terminators/65-40418/\">X-terminators</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"/bob-layton/26-10299/\">Bob Layton</a> and <a href=\"/jackson-butch-guice/26-7151/\">Jackson Guice</a> were the creative team for X-Factor vol 1 #1 (2/1986) that brought the original X-Men back together. <a href=\"/josef-joe-rubinstein/26-1669/\">Joe Rubinstein</a> also inked some of the art in this issue. Five years later, <a href=\"/peter-david/26-40682/\">Peter David</a> and <a href=\"/larry-stroman/26-13370/\">Larry Stroman</a> were the creative team for X-Factor vol 1 #71 (10/1991) that brought established allies of the X-Men together as a reformatted X-Factor team sanctioned by a branch of the US government. <a href=\"/al-milgrom/26-3259/\">Al Milgrom</a> was the inker for this issue.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>X-Factor rescued many mutants like <a href=\"/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a>, <a href=\"../../boom-boom/29-2159/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boom Boom</a>, <a href=\"../../rusty-collins/29-13376/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rusty</a>, <a href=\"../../skids/29-3194/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skids</a>, and <a href=\"../../artie/29-10574/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Artie</a>. <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> was kidnapped by the scientist <a href=\"/carl-maddicks/29-30821/\">Carl Maddicks</a>, and, in an attempt to \"cure\" him, Maddicks changed his appearance back to before he grew his fur. During one of their first battles, they came into conflict with <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> and his band of mutant outlaws. They were one of the teams fighting against the <a href=\"../../marauders/65-40480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marauders</a> during the <a href=\"../../mutant-massacre/39-41407/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mutant Massacre</a> in the <a href=\"/morlock-tunnels/34-41282/\">Morlock Tunnels</a>; it was at this time that Angel sacrificed himself to save a number of mutants and ended up losing his wings. Extremely depressed over the loss, Warren then escaped from the hospital and attempted to commit suicide, but was saved at the last second by Apocalypse so that he could become the Horseman of Death.</p><p>After the Massacre, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott</a> traveled to Alaska to find his wife <a href=\"../../madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madelyne</a> and their son <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nathan,</a> but could not do so; even the neighbors claimed to have no idea who he was talking about. During a battle with the <a href=\"/horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a>, <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a> was touched by <a href=\"../../pestilence/29-24133/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pestilence;</a> his mutant physiology reacted by allowing him to become stronger at the cost of his intelligence, which was later restored, along with his fur, by <a href=\"../../infectia/29-15089/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infectia</a>. Madelyne returned as the Goblin Queen after selling her soul to the demon <a href=\"../../sym/29-10291/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sym</a>; she used her new found powers to warp the city of <a href=\"/new-york-state/34-56310/\">New York</a> and tried to sacrifice her son to get revenge against <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scott</a> for leaving her, but she died in battle against <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey</a> before she could kill him. After being attacked by the <a href=\"/genoshan-magistrates/65-25418/\">Magistrates</a>, they traveled to <a href=\"/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a> during the <a href=\"../../x-tinction-agenda/39-42177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-tinction Agenda</a>. While there, they fought alongside the X-Men against a robotic <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/29-13379/\">Cameron Hodge</a>, the Magistrates, and Scott's brainwashed younger brother <a href=\"../../havok/29-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a>. When they finished the fight and returned to <a href=\"../../new-york-city/34-41183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York</a>, they battled Apocalypse and Scott's son Nathan was infected with the <a href=\"/techno-organic/12-43631/\">techno-organic virus</a>; in order to save Nathan, Scott sent him into the future. The original X-Factor members eventually rejoined the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> after <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a> returned from space.</p><h3>The Government Team</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"108157\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/108157-186325-x-factor_super.jpg\" title=\"U.S Government X-Factor\"><img id=\"108157\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/108157-186325-x-factor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"U.S Government X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">U.S Government X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>A US government agency led by <a href=\"../../havok/29-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a> later took on the name X-Factor.

Before the team is even officially came together <a href=\"../../mr-sinister/29-3179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mister Sinister</a> set a plan in motion to destroy them with the help of a US senator and his new team the <a href=\"../../nasty-boys/65-15150/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nasty Boys</a>. They are sent by the government to help a dictator named <a href=\"/farnoq-dahn/29-27802/\">Farnoq Dahn</a> destroy a rebel force aided by the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a> and the <a href=\"/pantheon/34-57314/\">Pantheon</a> in Trans-Sabal.</p><p>After they battle the Hulk and Havok is knocked unconscious, he is taken by <a href=\"../../farnoq-dahn/29-27802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Farnoq Dahn</a> and turned in to a living nuclear bomb so he can take over the world. Hulk and X-Factor team up to take him down and force Farnoq Dahn to face his people. Unfortunately most people still believe that he is a god so <a href=\"../../rick-jones/29-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Jones</a> takes control of a <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> <a href=\"../../mandroids/29-9665/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mandroid</a> and shoots him. When the group travels to Genosha, Madrox is infected with the <a href=\"../../legacy-virus/12-42281/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus</a> which causes his dupes to behave erratically and it eventually results in his death.</p><p>The team goes through many changes through the years. Havok is kidnapped and brainwashed for a bit and even once its broken stays with the Brotherhood. Strong Guy has a heart attack and Wolfsbane quits. Polaris goes through a dark period in her life and relationship.

Originally calling his company XXX Investigations, the group settled on the name X-Factor Investigations after the team they were formerly members of. Jamie also hired <a href=\"../../siryn/29-3181/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siryn</a> and <a href=\"../../m/29-40460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M</a>, who were former teammates of his during his time with Paris branch of <a href=\"../../x-corporation/65-40425/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Corporation</a>.</p><p>After <a href=\"../../m-day/12-41003/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day</a> the majority of the inhabitants of mutant town lost their powers. <a href=\"../../rictor/29-10988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rictor</a> was one of the depowered mutants and after considering suicide (with help from one of Jamie's dupes) was convinced to join X-Factor with the others.</p><p>The cryptic child <a href=\"../../layla-miller/29-1447/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Layla Miller</a> ended up spending a lot of time at X-Factor Investigations, often irritating and confusing the occupants. Layla continued to hang out with X-Factor, subtly influencing the members actions with the stuff she knows. Learning more about her life as an orphan, she was invited to live with the team.</p><p>The team has since encountered a deranged depowered mutant named <a href=\"/doctor-leery/29-77029/\">Doctor Leery</a>, <a href=\"../../damian-tryp/29-40708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Damian Tryp</a> and his rival investigation firm <a href=\"../../singularity-investigations/65-47393/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Singularity Investigations</a>, the <a href=\"../../isolationist/29-45713/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isolationist</a>, mercenaries <a href=\"../../clay/29-6121/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"../../solo/29-15485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Solo</a>, depowered mutant terrorist group <a href=\"../../x-cell/65-43339/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Cell</a> (including the <a href=\"../../blob/29-3182/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blob</a> and <a href=\"../../marrow/29-13726/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marrow</a>), and most recently Silver Age X-Men villain <a href=\"../../arcade/29-8429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade</a>. The team has also notably been rivals with former teammate <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a> who has often tried to repower the depowered mutants with ineffective and often disastrous results.</p><p>X-Factor has also experienced internal friction after a drunken Multiple Man created dupes that slept with both <a href=\"../../m/29-40460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monet</a> and <a href=\"../../siryn/29-3181/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siryn</a>. At first the two girls stopped speaking to each other, but the pair then became frequent partners and best friends.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Although often non-combatant rivals with the X-Men, X-Factor Investigations were recruited to participate in the fight for the first new mutant baby which launched <a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a>.</p><p>Madrox agreed to send two dupes of his to the future (with the help of <a href=\"../../forge/29-4279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a>) to gain information about the future. Layla hitched a ride on the device and became stuck in the future. Unbeknown to Madrox, there was no way in retrieving the dupes and Cyclops and Forge had intended to kill his duplicated selves so Madrox Prime could reabsorb the information. With Layla trapped in the future, alternative methods were needed but Jamie soon fell into a coma.</p><p>In the future, after being imprisoned in a mutant concentration camp, Layla and one of Madrox's duplicates met up with a young <a href=\"../../bishop/29-1503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lucas Bishop</a>. After learning about the stories he was told about a mutant baby damning the mutant race, Layla stole a bomb from one of the security guards and threw it at the Madrox dupe, allowing Madrox Prime to wake up. Madrox awoke in a panic, relaying the information to the X-Men and with a M tattooed over his face eye. Layla is now stuck in the future, and it is unknown what happened to the other dupe.</p><p>During the event, Rictor also posed as a baseline human who hated mutants in order to infiltrate the Purifiers. Under the guise of \"Joaquin Murrieta\", Rictor pretended to shoot and perhaps fatally injure Wolfsbane in front of members of the group to gain entrance. He then gathered information from their computers to relay to the X-Men about their advanced technology and information regarding the whereabouts of the mutant baby.</p><p>The New X-Men, on a mission of revenge, interrupted his undercover duty blowing his cover. Luckily, Rictor was teleported away from the scene in time. Monet, Siryn, and Strong Guy's role in the mission was to participate in combat against the Marauders and the Acolytes on Muir Island. Wolfsbane participated in the X-Force as one of the vicious trackers, a role she would continue with undercover under the orders of Cyclops.</p><p>X-Factor was falling apart during the <a href=\"/divided-we-stand/39-52603/\">Divided We Stand</a> story arc. Madrox has since nearly broken down particularly over the loss of Layla Miller. Siryn has revealed she is pregnant with Jamie's child, but has been unable to properly communicate with him since she found out.</p><p>Wolfsbane has decided to stay with <a href=\"../../x-force/65-15595/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Force</a>, in part because she has seen a future in which she will kill Jamie Madrox. After a scornful goodbye, she parts ways with Jamie and only leaves a note for Rictor, with whom she's had a romantic relationship in the previous months.</p><p>Upon reading the letter, an already distraught Rictor decides to leave the team. As he leaves the building, he falls into a trap door that leaves him under the capture of X-Men villain <a href=\"../../arcade/29-8429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade</a> and the Purifier he tricked into letting him into their group.</p><p>The group eventually comes to his rescue but not before Arcade escapes revealing that he has put a force-field around the city that will trap everyone inside as a bomb detonates the entire perimeter. The bomb, implanted within the ex-Purifier upon his last heart beat, prepares to detonate as he drinks his last sip of poison.</p><p>X-Factor became aware of the <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a> of Earth. In the three part story arc with <a href=\"../../she-hulk/29-1449/\" rel=\"nofollow\">She-Hulk</a>, X-Factor get their first client in their new location, <a href=\"../../detroit-michigan/34-55783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detroit, Michigan</a>. The client is looking for his son, who happens to be former X-Man <a href=\"../../darwin/29-40600/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darwin</a> who happens to be traveling with <a href=\"../../longshot/29-6757/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Longshot</a>.</p><p>Upon finding Darwin and Longshot and chasing them across Detroit, She-Hulk and <a href=\"../../jazinda/29-48744/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jazinda</a> turn up resulting in a fight between X-Factor and She-Hulk. It is then revealed that Longshot isn't Longshot at all and is in fact <a href=\"../../nogor/29-56517/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nogor</a>, representative of the <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrull</a> gods, whose presence on earth gives the Skrulls morale and helps them believe they are blessed in this war. Jazinda had told She-Hulk, which was the reason they were in Detroit and with everything out in the open, She Hulk and X-Factor make up and set about saving the world from the Skrulls.</p><p>Nogor is finally captured and is taken off into the distance and Darwin remains with the X-Factor team.</p><p>While Madrox, Monet, Strong Guy and Longshot are investigating the disappearance of Darwin, <a href=\"../../valerie-cooper/29-14860/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Val Cooper</a> turns up with an escort of government agents to reveal to Siryn and Rictor that in fact X-Factor Investigations has been working for the government.</p><p>During this time Syrin goes into labor and Val Cooper is shot on the lawn. Siryn takes Val off to the hospital and herself to have her baby.</p><p>The gang return from their search and rescue mission for Darwin at the Karma project. Madrox and Siryn become engaged thanks to her asking the question. The baby is finally delivered and as a precaution Madrox follows the baby on its way to the nursery so he isn't stolen by the government.</p><p>Upon holding the new baby (now named Sean after his grandfather) it becomes apparent that this isn't any normal homosapien baby, surprise, surprise. A strange glow surrounds Sean and Madrox feels the same sensation as he does when he absorbs his dupes, then baby Sean, like a dupe is absorbed.</p><p>Siryn is obviously livid with Madrox and upon discovering the conception of her baby was with a dupe of Jamie and not Jamie himself, she promises to break his neck.</p><h2><strong>OTHER MEDIA</strong></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1456819\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1456819-factorsanc_super.jpg\" title=\"Animated X-Factor\"><img id=\"1456819\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1456819-factorsanc_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Animated X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Animated X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>X-Men: The Animated Series, The team appeared in the episode ''cold comfort'', it is where Iceman broke into their building (facility) to find his partner (girlfriend Polaris) and then ran afoul of the X-Men.

Their newest member <a href=\"/arachne/29-16197/\">Spider-Woman</a> wasn't happy about this, so she freed them and thereby became a fugitive from the U.S. government. A little while later, the three WW2 veterans <a href=\"/crimson-commando/29-14906/\">Crimson Commando</a>, <a href=\"/stonewall/29-29855/\">Stonewall</a> and <a href=\"/super-sabre/29-14907/\">Super Sabre</a>, wanting to hunt down and execute criminals, had a run-in with <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, that ended in their defeat and them turning themselves in. The government determined that the former heroes were still reformable and therefore included in the ranks of Freedom Force.</p><p>From there on, they went on a lot of missions of difficult nature, such as upholding the <a href=\"/mutant-registration-act/12-43657/\">Mutant Registration Act</a>, which led to another conflict with the X-Men. But they also had some heroic deeds, like saving the people of Dallas (\"<a href=\"/fall-of-the-mutants/39-41745/\">Fall of the Mutants</a>\" storyline). Rumors that they were forcing young and potential mutants into training for governmental service led to clashes with <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> and the <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>, around which time Spiral decided to leave the team.</p><p>A while later, when the <a href=\"/commission-on-superhuman-activities/65-42060/\">Commission on Superhuman Activities</a> forced <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Steve Rogers</a> to resign as Captain America, they found a replacement Captain America in <a href=\"/usagent/29-14992/\">John Walker</a>. The new Captain America, and his partner <a href=\"/battlestar/29-13744/\">Battlestar</a>, began working for the Commission and joined Freedom Force. This line-up of Freedom Force battled the Avengers, The <a href=\"/the-resistants/65-55836/\">Resistants</a> and one of <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse's</a> <a href=\"/horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\">Horsemen</a>. Eventually, Walker was shot by <a href=\"/scourge/29-14461/\">Scourge</a> and Battlestar left the Commission's employ shortly after.</p><p>After that, Freedom Force was set up for some hard times. By request of <a href=\"/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a>, they protected <a href=\"/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a> against the <a href=\"/reavers/65-9726/\">Reavers</a>, but at the cost of Stonewall and <a href=\"/destiny/29-3557/\">Destiny</a> being killed and <a href=\"/avalanche/29-3553/\">Avalanche</a> severely injured. That had a big impact on Mystique, which rendered her temporarily incapable of leading the team. Shortly after that, <a href=\"/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a> possessed Valerie Copper with the intention of killing Mystique, but Valerie was able to resist his influence, which resulted in her injuring herself. Mystique used this moment to switch roles with Cooper, thereby gaining access to Shadow King's circle of confidants. Later on, she played a crucial part in defeating the Shadow King together with the X-Men and X-Factor.</p><p>Meanwhile, the remaining members went on a mission in Kuwait during the first Gulf War, where they clashed with <a href=\"/desert-sword/65-46736/\">Desert Sword</a>. That led to Super Sabre being killed and Crimson Commando so severely hurt, that Avalanche was forced to leave <a href=\"/pyro/29-3554/\">Pyro</a> and <a href=\"/blob/29-3182/\">Blob</a> behind in order to save Commando's life. This was the end for Freedom Force as a team, even though Avalanche and Commando continued to work for the government as covert op agents. The government then took to another mutant group as replacement: X-Factor.</p>",

Both races started using cloning to make a work force. While the green martians treated the clones as equals, the white martians treated them as slaves. This lead to a civil war. When the war was over, the victorious green martians banished the remaining 70 white martians to the still zone (their name for&nbsp;the P<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">hantom Zone</a>).</p>\n<p>Extricating themselves from the Still Zone aka Ghost Zone or Phantom Zone, the White Martians returned to Earth in the guise of gods calling themselves the Hyperclan, basing themselves in the 5000 year old martian city called&nbsp;Z'onn Z'orr &nbsp;in Antarctica. The Martians claimed their homeworld had been destroyed by negligence and greed and they offered to save Earth from a similar fate. The Hyperclan turned deserts into verdant paradises and ended crime by executing meta-criminals. This was all part of their insidious plan to discredit and destroy the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League</a>. Earth's real heroes, with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman </a>as a spearhead, &nbsp;saw through this ruse and put a stop to it right away. All hope seemed lost after the White Martians took away the only means of defeating them, by burning them with fire. The Martians took this away from Earth by inhibiting the Earth's atmosphere with subatomic particles that inhibited any combustible reaction. To find a way around this, the Justice League lured the Martians to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-watchtower/34-41469/\">Justice League Watchtower</a> and defeated them there. Instead of sending them back to the Phantom Zone, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">J'onn</a> brainwashed them into thinking they where humans and released them to live among humans.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>There came a time when the concept of evil was unleashed throughout the universe and the Maltusians now on <a href=\"/oa/34-41360/\">Oa</a> felt themselves to blame. Now <a href=\"/immortality/12-43944/\">immortal</a>, these cosmic beings felt it their duty to solve the problem. Their discussions led to a deep, irreparable rift among the male Oans: some wanted direct \"hands on\" intervention while others felt surrogates were the best way to operate. The more aggressive Oans left their world and their ways, going deep into the universe, their ultimate goals unknown.</p><p>Little was heard from those Oans for billions of years until finally, word reached the known populated universe that agents of NEMO (Network for the Establishment and Maintenance of Order) were roaming the stars. They challenged evil in all its forms and fought it bravely, without fear; sacrificing their lives to bring justice to the needy.</p><p>Rivaling the fabled <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a> themselves, it seems these Darkstars, with their powerful armor and intensive training, were continuing to grow in strength and resourcefulness.</p><p>Among these Darkstars was a veteran, a man who had seen just about all you could imagine: <a href=\"/ferrin-colos/29-4608/\">Ferrin Colos</a>, survivor of the ravaged world Zamba. When his world was attacked by raiders, he vowed vengeance and signed up to be a Darkstar so no other world would suffer as his did. Over time, his enthusiasm faded and a hard cynicism invaded. Now, feeling old and tired, Cobs did not care if he survived his next mission.</p><p>When the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians of the Universe</a> went to another dimension in order to reevaluate their goals, the Oans-now called <a href=\"/the-controllers/65-22708/\">Controllers</a>-had their Darkstars sweep out through the universe, filling the obvious void left by the dismantled Green Lantern Corps. Their influence and success made them respected-and feared. The upstart mercenary organization <a href=\"/legion/65-47223/\">LEGION</a> never seemed a concern, and when the Guardians returned and the GL Corps began rebuilding, the Darkstars never slowed down.</p><p>So it was that Colos was sent after a drug smuggler and his trail led him to Earth, long considered a backwater planet of above-average cosmic importance. Colos successfully defeated the drug smugglers and their Earth-based processing operation, but rather than return him home, his supervisor, the crafty <a href=\"/huvah-jeddigar/29-18545/\">Huvah Jeddigar</a>, orders him to remain on Earth, opening a base, keeping an eye on this increasingly important corner of the universe.</p><p>Seeking help in understanding human ways, Colos settled in Dallas, <a href=\"/texas/34-55822/\">Texas</a> and chose two humans as his deputies, bestowing upon them Darkstar armor and training in exchange for guidance and maybe even friendship. These humans are <a href=\"/mo-douglas/29-12184/\">Mo Douglas</a>, a homeless Vietnam veteran and <a href=\"/john-flint/29-12189/\">John Flint</a>, a narcotics police officer who is just as hardened as Colos. They put on the armor just in time to face <a href=\"/evil-star/29-9549/\">Evil Star</a> and his Starlings, seeking vengeance against Green Lantern. They acquitted themselves well and currently continue their training. Together, these three Darkstars patrolled the Earth, seeking out crime and waiting for a call to engage otherworldly threats.</p><p><a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> lost her godlike powers following the defeat of her power-mad son, <a href=\"/lord-chaos/29-9945/\">Lord Chaos</a>. Seeking a new direction, Donna became a member of the Darkstars. Shortly afterward, former Green Lantern <a href=\"/john-stewart/29-10451/\">John Stewart</a> became a Darkstar, leading the intergalactic police force.</p><p>Following a conflict on the planet <a href=\"/rann/34-55709/\">Rann</a>, the Darkstar ranks were severely depleted. <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>'s son <a href=\"/grayven/29-10000/\">Grayven</a> cut a swath of destruction that decimated the Darkstar forces, destroying most of their super-powered uniforms. John Stewart was crippled in the conflict, and <a href=\"/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Donna Troy</a> opted to abandon her Darkstar uniform and live a normal life for awhile. The Darkstars continued to police the galaxy, even with their dwindled numbers.</p><p>Of the four remaining Darkstars one was killed by <a href=\"/fatality/29-6943/\">Fatality</a> and the final three died when their suits overloaded on <a href=\"/rann/34-55709/\">Rann</a> battling the <a href=\"/starbreaker/29-4605/\">Starbreaker</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The powerful Darkstar <a href=\"/darkstar-exo-mantle/18-47115/\">Exo-Mantle</a> augments the wearer's strength, speed and agility. The armor also allows the wearer to fly through the atmosphere at high speeds and projects a force field sufficient to withstand wind friction and not harm the occupant. The suit also enabled the wearer to fire low-level laser blasts.</p>",

They stopped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helspont/40632/\">Helspont</a> and destroyed the orb. With this done they start doing missions that mainly involve finding Daemonites and killing them. Their first mission after beating the Cabal brings them in contact with the characters of Cyber Force. For nearly the entire (6 issue) crossover, the teams fought each other thanks to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/misery/40879/\">Misery</a>, the real enemy, who had been playing the sides against one another. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warblade/12014/\">Warblade</a> killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/misery/40879/\">Misery</a> and the teams worked things out. The WildC.A.T.S tried to take a vacation after all this but the cruise ship Voodoo, Spartan, and Emp were on disappeared. When the rest of the team went to save them, they discovered that another Kherubim was responsible. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lord-entropy/40880/\">Lord Entropy</a> had taken the ship, but the WildC.A.T.S arrived in time to defeat him and rescue their teammates. When he found out Entropy was his own brother, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emp/21970/\">Emp</a> quit the team for a while. Since <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/voodoo/12013/\">Voodoo</a> hadn\u2019t been able to protect herself when she had been kidnapped, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/11586/\">Zealot</a> decided to train her in the ways of the Coda. As she was training her, a space ship crashed close by and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/11586/\">Zealot</a> met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/huntsman/40882/\">Huntsman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miranda-tai/40883/\">Miranda Tai</a>. They had traveled across dimensions to escape an alien enemy. In the past Emp had promised their leader, Alabaster Wu, that Earth would be a safe place for them, so they had come. One of the aliens possessed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/voodoo/12013/\">Voodoo</a> and took her to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tapestry/40662/\">Tapestry</a>, an enemy of Zealot. Zealot, Huntsman and Miranda went to fight Tapestry. The rest of the WildC.A.T.S got involved with the fight, going up against the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/troika/40692/\">Troika</a>, mercenaries that Tapestry had hired. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savant/21971/\">Savant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-majestic/21972/\">Mr. Majestic</a> came in as back up. Zealot beat Tapestry, Emp rejoined the group and Savant and Majestic left until they were needed again. The group was next attacked by the Black Razors, government funded super cops with lots of technology. The Black Razors were there to kill <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maul/21968/\">Maul</a>, who had been replaced by an enemy trying to kill Emp. After this was sorted out and the enemy was killed, the group had to find the real Maul. They found him lying unconscious in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stormwatch/26261/\">Stormwatch</a> base and teleported him away without explaining themselves to the other team. It was at the end of this adventure that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/voodoo/12013/\">Voodoo</a> discovered that she was half-Daemonite.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"82735\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/82735-191055-wildc-a-t-s_super.jpg\" title=\"WildC.A.T.S.

This attack was the beginning of \u201cWildstorm Rising\u201d, a crossover event that included most of the Image titles at the time. From talking to Hightower the Wild C.A.T.S found out about a space ship that other Daemonites were after, so they and other super groups went after the ship. The Wild C.A.T.S (except for Grifter) took the ship and went to Khera, the Kherubim home planet. Meanwhile, back on Earth, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savant/21971/\">Savant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-majestic/21972/\">Mr. Majestic</a> made a new Wild C.A.T.S team. They recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/condition-red/21985/\">Condition Red</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ladytron/12011/\">Ladytron</a>. Majestic lead the team in battle but <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savant/21971/\">Savant</a> determined who they would go after. Unfortunately, she was being manipulated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a>, who was maneuvering the new Wild C.A.T.S into starting a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gang-war/40664/\">Gang War</a>. The original group returned right as the crime war was taking off, but they couldn\u2019t stop to help their replacements. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grifter/23624/\">Grifter</a> took the team (not including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/voodoo/12013/\">Voodoo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emp/21970/\">Emp</a> who had left after what took place on Khera) to Gamorra to help <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathblow/24637/\">Deathblow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gen-13/40400/\">Gen 13</a>. Majestic followed them when he saw the face of the man behind the problems in Gamorra. It was the face of his friend John Colt, a Kherubim he\u2019d been forced to kill during their short time as members of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/team-1/40690/\">Team 1</a>. His Kherubim body had survived and grown evil so Majestic had to kill him again, this time blasting him to ash. The team returned and now both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildc-a-t-s/25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a> groups were fighting in the crime war. When everyone found out that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a> was behind it all and went after him, most of the team was defeated by his intellect, mind control and other skills. He fought <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ladytron/12011/\">Ladytron</a> and pulled out the part of her that kept her nuclear power system in check so Majestic had to cut her in half and take her core to space where it blew up. He survived the nuclear explosion and came back just as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a> was about to take out the rest of the team. He killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a> and the WildC.A.T.S ended the war. (It gets revealed at the end of the first volume that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a> had \u201cconvinced\u201d the shape shifting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mister-white/40636/\">Mister White</a> to stand in for him and die in his place.) After the crime war the other <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildc-a-t-s/25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a> told the new team what had happened on Khera.</p><p>They said that the war was over and that Earth had to fend for itself. Several of the members (Emp and Zealot in particular) had done things they weren\u2019t proud of on Khera, like abandoning their friends and turning against one another. The team was fractured after this, but the gang war had pulled them back together, mostly. While the group was figuring out what they should do now that the Daemonite war wasn\u2019t so serious, they were attacked by a Kherubim-hunter named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crusade/21974/\">Crusade</a>. He was an enhanced human who was stronger and smarter than he appeared. He was able to go head-to-head with both groups of Wild C.A.T.S. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savant/21971/\">Savant</a> beat him by messing with his head like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tao/4590/\">Tao</a> used to, and while he was out cold <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/11586/\">Zealot</a> tried to kill him but Majestic stopped her. After this little episode, Savant and Majestic left the team and Ladytron joined the Church of Gort and left as well. With Condition Red injured and missing and Tao presumed dead, the new Wild C.A.T.S were all gone and the original group was back. The last big event of the first volume was a time traveling adventure. The Puritans, a group of humans dedicated to ridding the Earth of all alien life and influence were planning to go back in time and destroy the Kherubim and Daemonite ships before they landed on Earth. The C.A.T.S tried to stop them before they left, enlisting the aid of several people, including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/condition-red/21985/\">Condition Red</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mythos/21966/\">Mythos</a>. Emp, Warblade and Maul were already being held in the Puritan base, but the team saved them. Some of the Puritans were able to get into the time machine, so <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/condition-red/21985/\">Condition Red</a> (going by Max now), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mythos/21966/\">Mythos</a>, <a href=\"/void/29-12010/\">Void</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spartan/12006/\">Spartan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grifter/23624/\">Grifter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/olympia/40913/\">Olympia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sister-eve/40914/\">Sister Eve</a> went after them. They traveled back to when the Kherubim and Daemonites first came to Earth, making stops and meeting friends and enemies along the way. By the time they reached their final destination, only Grifter, Max, Mythos and Spartan were still alive. They were able to stop the Puritans and took their devices so they could get back to their time and the Puritans (who were still alive) couldn\u2019t. Max used one device to save Olympia from when she had died and bring her back to the present. When he got back, he was killed by a mysterious woman, but everyone else made it. The Wild C.A.T.S had saved he past and the present.</p><h3>Wildcats</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"189762\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/189762-160190-wildc-a-t-s_super.jpg\" title=\"Wildcats\"><img id=\"189762\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/189762-160190-wildc-a-t-s_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wildcats\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wildcats</div></div></div></div><p>The second incarnation of the Wildcats was very different from the first and was preparation for the third. Several team members were missing from the very beginning and new members were added. Some characters got new looks and others died. The team changed from the old covert action team to a new organization, the corporation that would be the main focus of the third volume. The first issue had <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grifter/23624/\">Grifter</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spartan/12006/\">Spartan</a> working to uncover a stolen Kherubim weapon of great power. They met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/noir/12012/\">Noir</a>, an arms dealer that became part of their team thanks to his intelligence and technical skills. A very different Lord <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emp/21970/\">Emp</a> now leads the team. His new state was part of a plan to ascend and become something like a god. He also revealed the teams new enemy, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kenyan/40900/\">Kenyan</a>, an evil immortal with enough stolen alien technology to destroy the world. The story behind Kenyan and his relationship with Emp was the driving force behind most the things that the new team did. The next issue is about <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maul/21968/\">Maul</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/voodoo/12013/\">Voodoo</a>, two members of the old team that weren\u2019t really part of the new team but still had their own adventures. The two were living together while Maul was secretly trying to find a way to remove the Daemonite part of Voodoo so she could be 100% human. It\u2019s during this that it\u2019s shown that Maul can increase his intelligence by shrinking instead of just losing it as he grows bigger. There was also a Daemonite following Voodoo but that didn\u2019t get addressed until much later. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/c-c-rendozzo/40908/\">C. C. Rendozzo</a> was introduced when she kidnapped Maul to get him to work for her. Maul and Voodoo stayed with her for a while but eventually went back home. The next few issues had the Wildcats (Spartan, Noir, Grifter and Emp) trying to get to Kenyan as well as a single issue where Kenyan was introduced and told a little about what happened between volumes one and two.</p><p>He revealed that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/11586/\">Zealot</a> was killed and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warblade/12014/\">Warblade</a> was on a private mission. (Zealot wasn\u2019t really dead, just killing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/coda/40958/\">Coda</a> warriors in secret, and Warblade was hunting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pike/24922/\">Pike</a>.) Emp went off alone to meet Kenyan and the team tried to track him down. They didn\u2019t know that he needed to be killed in order to ascend and he wanted Kenyan to kill him since the one who kills him dies in the process. The team found them both but Kenyan went crazy and killed himself. With no one to kill him (since no one can do it without dying) Emp turned to Spartan. Spartan killed Emp and his android body kept him alive. After that the team took a break for a while and Grifter found, saved and came back with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ladytron/12011/\">Ladytron</a>. Spartan had inherited all of Emp\u2019s money when he \u201cdied\u201d and was using all of it to start a company, the Halo Corporation. He also got a less human version of <a href=\"/void/29-12010/\">Void</a> to work for him when she gave up her soul in issue 13. The next arc had a super powered killer go after Spartan (who had now changed his name to Jack Marlowe). Unfortunately, the killer met Voodoo and Maul before he found Spartan. He blinded Maul and cut Voodoo\u2019s legs off. He also destroyed Ladytron. Grifter and Spartan dealt with the attacker but his appearance led to the addition of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-wax/12008/\">Agent Wax</a> to the Wildcats team. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-orange/12004/\">Agent Orange</a> was the next threat to the team. Maul (now healed) had been doing something illegal so the FBI had sent Agent Orange to deal with him. Grifter helped him out before going on his own little kill-fest with Zealot. Voodoo learned of some Daemonite powers she had never known about when the Daemonite that had been following her came to her room. She learned to stop time as well as heal herself, growing her legs back in a short time. Before long, Noir grew tired of working with Spartan and decided to use some technology Spartan had come up with to make money. He designed a battery that would work forever thanks to another a power source from another dimension that Spartan found. To use the source however, he had to get rid of Spartan. He rebuilt Ladytron to kill Spartan but she couldn\u2019t kill him. Spartan killed Noir and used his idea to create an everlasting battery that would become the foundation of the Halo Corporation.</p><h3>Wildcats Version 3.0</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"82292\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/82292-134216-wildc-a-t-s_super.jpg\" title=\"Wildcats Version 3.0\"><img id=\"82292\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/82292-134216-wildc-a-t-s_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wildcats Version 3.0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wildcats Version 3.0</div></div></div></div><p>In the third volume of Wildcats, the team had officially become a business and not a fighting team. Spartan was sporting the new look he had picked up in the second volume and was publically going by Jack Marlowe, head of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/halo-corporation/41734/\">Halo Corporation</a>. The Halo Corporation was the tool Jack used to realize his dream of a better world. In almost every issue of Wildcats 3.0 the Halo Corporation came out with another product that would make the world a better place and bring people closer together. Batteries that lasted forever, cars that ran without gas and computers that would never need to be upgraded, replaced or even plugged in were just some of the products of the Halo Corporation. The newest version of the team was made up of Jack Marlowe ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spartan/12006/\">Spartan</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grifter/23624/\">Grifter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-wax/12008/\">Agent Wax</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-dolby/40906/\">Mr. Dolby</a>. Aside from Grifter, who still liked to engage in a little violence (sometimes taking Wax with him), the team worked mostly in the offices of the Halo Corporation building, planning ways to better the company and increase it's influence. The only enemy of the Wildcats (at least in the beginning) was the government. They feared the Halo Corporation because it threatened to change the world, fortunately there was nothing they could do to stop Spartan. While Spartan dealt with branding his products, merchandising and sabotage, Grifter and Agent Wax were investigating other things. They quickly crossed paths with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/c-c-rendozzo/40908/\">C. C. Rendozzo</a>, a violent and wealthy information broker. They ended up working with her in her efforts to find her son, and as a result, came into contact with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-orange/12004/\">Agent Orange</a> (an old enemy) and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nuclear-family/40912/\">Nuclear Family</a> (a new one).</p><p>Grifter ended up having both of his legs destroyed, which would leave him in a wheel chair for the rest of the volume. (Don't think for a minute though that a little thing like broken legs kept Grifter out of battle for long.) After the failed team up with Rendozzo and her men, Grifter and Wax went back to the Halo Corporation's offices where Grifter found out that Jack was holding on to Agent Orange, the guy who had crippled him, and keeping him not only alive, but in the building where they worked. Rendozzo came to Jack ready to blackmail him if he wouldn't help her get her son back from the FBI. Her son's father had taken him and was training him to be a ruthless monster that would work for the FBI, and she wanted him back. Two things started happening at the same time; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-wax/12008/\">Agent Wax</a> got demoted (at his real job where Jack had him working undercover) and started having sex with his boss' wife to get revenge, and Grifter started grooming <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-dolby/40906/\">Mr. Dolby</a> to be a temporary replacement for himself. Dolby's training started before he knew what was going on, when Grifter had the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beef-boys/40911/\">Beef Boys</a> work Dolby over in his apartment one night. The next day Grifter told Dolby that he wanted to train him and Dolby almost shot him in the face for what he'd had done to him. Instead, he agreed and started training for real at Grifter's side. Jack knew Grifter was training Dolby so he had Grifter organize the Beef Boys and Mr. Dolby so they could go save Rendozzo's son.</p><p>The attack on FBI headquarters was a success, but Dolby shot a man in the face and when they got back to the Halo Corporation, he quit. Wax's story, which had been going on quietly in the background didn't end much better. His boss caught him with his wife and almost killed him. Wax's quick thinking saved him. He got his boss to kill himself, then used his hypnosis powers to make everyone he worked with think he was the boss, giving him control over the National Park Service (which was really an organization that hunted down super powered beings). Jack got Mr. Dolby back to work in time for the next story arc. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/11586/\">Zealot</a>, who had been killing her way through hordes of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/coda/40958/\">Coda</a> warriors, was back on the scene. She had FBI agents following the bodies she left behind and trying to stop her. The FBI had a secret weapon they were going to use if they ever caught her, Agent Orange. Jack had reprogrammed Orange and gave him back to the FBI. They thought he was working for them, but in reality, Jack was in control and now had his own spy right under the nose of the FBI. While Zealot was killing Coda, Grifter had one of Rendozzo's smartest guys do some work on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ladytron/12011/\">Ladytron</a>'s body. He had it altered so he could pilot it from the Halo Corporation. The Zealot/Coda war finally peaked and the Coda sent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sarin/40840/\">Sarin</a>, their best assassin, after Zealot. In the battle that ensued, the FBI (and Agent Orange) finally caught up with her. The whole fight ended with Sarin taking every one of them back to the Coda base. When Grifter got news of this, he organized a special team consisting of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-dolby/40906/\">Mr. Dolby</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beef-boys/40911/\">Beef Boys</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/c-c-rendozzo/40908/\">C. C. Rendozzo</a> and some of her men. This team was led by Grifter in the body of Ladytron. The group went after Zealot, killing armies of Coda along the way. Meanwhile, back at the office, a telepathic assassin had been sent to kill Jack Marlowe. It wasn't even a threat though, Jack just threw the attacker into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/otherspace/41058/\">Otherspace</a>.</p><p>Grifter's team finally made it to the Coda base and the real battle began. They fought countless Coda warriors and were so overwhelmed that they couldn't even make it to the entrance of the hideout. Fortunately, Jack's inside man was able to help out. Agent Orange started taking down the Coda from within. He got Zealot to Grifter before the entire base was destroyed. One of the kidnapped FBI agents had found the armory and set off every bomb she could get her hands on. The mountain and all the Coda in it were destroyed. All of Grifter's team (except for one of the Beef Boys who had already died) were teleported to safety by Jack Marlowe. He had been watching everything as it took place but didn't interfere. With the Coda gone and no one left for Grifter to fight, Jack was ready to take the Wildcats and the Halo Corporation in a new direction.</p><h3><b>Worldstorm Universe</b></h3><h3>Wildcats v4</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1568647\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10837/1568647-wc_silvestri_super.jpg\" title=\"Wildcats (Worldstorm Unniverse)\"><img id=\"1568647\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10837/1568647-wc_silvestri_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wildcats (Worldstorm Unniverse)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wildcats (Worldstorm Unniverse)</div></div></div></div><p>In a (failed) soft reboot of the Wildstorm Universe, the Wildcats team was split up and some members were never shown. Time had passed since 3.0 and Jack Marlowe and the Halo Corporation had become even more powerful. Jack worked from a space station orbiting the planet, and his newest technology had changed life on Earth. The household Spartan was a robot designed after himself that was family friendly and could be used by anyone, so everyone had one. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grifter/23624/\">Grifter</a> had apparently left the team, and lived on the streets. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/11586/\">Zealot</a> was on what looked like another planet with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-majestic/21972/\">Mr. Majestic</a>, fighting their old enemy, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daemonites/41061/\">Daemonites</a>, which were heading for Earth. <a href=\"/warblade/29-12014/\">Warblade</a> was spying on Kaizen Gamorra and informing Spartan of his presence and possible plans. No other members from any other incarnation were present except for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/voodoo/12013/\">Voodoo</a>, who visited Jack in the first issue. <i>The events in this section are now considered out of continuity as only one issue was published due to Grant Morrison &amp; Jim Lee's other obligations.</i></p><h3><b>Post-Worldstorm Universe</b></h3><h3>World's End</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1099193\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/1099193-wildcats4_super.jpg\" title=\"Wildcats (World's End)\"><img id=\"1099193\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/1099193-wildcats4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wildcats (World's End)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wildcats (World's End)</div></div></div></div><p>Because of actions taken by Nemesis orchestrated (unbeknownst to her) by the Wildcats old friend Tao, the world all but ended. The moon was destroyed, the Earth's orbit shifted, most of the planet's technology was obliterated, many heroes were missing, more SPBs than ever had appeared, and the Wildcats were only slightly better off than the rest of the world. The team was hit hard and the only reason they had a foothold in the world was because of the Halo batteries from 3.0. When most of the technology went out the energy in the batteries that could run forever kept the Halo building functioning. It was damaged, but it still worked so the Wildcats kept it as a base and shelter for whatever people they could find in the outside world. They couldn't get any more power though because the energy only worked around the Halo building and they couldn't just go get more since Jack Marlowe's Void powers were the only way to get to the dimension where it came from and Jack wasn't Jack anymore. He'd lost his Void powers when a new Void was born (Captain Atom: Armageddon) and his more advanced robotic abilities had been lost during World's End as a result of a particularly destructive EMP in his vicinity. He changed his name back to Hadrian (or Spartan) and was in an even worse state than he was at the beginning of Wildcats. He was back in his old body but the drastic shift from being practically a god to a robot really messed with his head and he no longer considers himself the leader of the team. The rest of the Wildcats were better off than Spartan. Other than Spartan this incarnation of the team consisted of originals Grifter, Maul (usually in his smallest form in order to be smart enough to work on the problems at hand), Warblade, Zealot and Voodoo as well as Ladytron (rebuilt again into a body similar to her original), Jet and Nemesis.</p><p>Other than scavenging for resources, trying to fix the rest of their tech, rescuing humans and dealing with bad SPBs, the team's biggest problem was former ally Majestic. For some reason the end of the world made him want to recreate Khera on Earth. He decided to do so in Hawaii and he frequently performed raids on the Halo building to take some of their technology and some humans that he said he could protect in Hawaii.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p><b>WildC.A.T.s series</b></p>",

        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>Team 7 was the seventh incarnation of a US Special Operations unit run by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/io/65-41214/\">International Operations</a> (I.O.), whose members are made up of the finest and best military operatives gathered from various military special forces units. The unit's main purpose was to safeguard the United States' national security abroad. Each member of the unit had a distinguishing red identification mark painted on their face.</p><p>Team 7 received its orders from I.O. Director, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miles-craven/29-59412/\">Miles Craven</a>. With a multitude of Meta-human teams appearing around the world, Craven wanted his own private army of superhumans to rival <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/youngblood/65-5196/\">Youngblood</a>, so Project: Genesis was born. A substance called the Gen-factor, which is one of the sources of superhuman powers, was discovered by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-tsung/29-23671/\">Dr. Simon Tsung</a> who also worked on the project. He would later leave after discovering Craven's own plans for the use of the Gen-factor.</p><p>Dr. Tsung's work was continued by Gabriel Newman. After several failed experiments, the first successful application of the Gen-factor was the exposure of Team 7 to the substance, effectively giving each team member special abilities and powers to some degree. After an incident in which Craven wanted to test the true abilities of the team, they went into hiding except for John Lynch and Michael Cray, the latter would spend time in a military prison. Team 7 would finally disband and go into hiding again several years later after discovering Craven's keen interest in the team members' children. These children would later become part of the two teenage superhuman groups, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gen-13/65-40400/\">Gen13</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dv8/65-41857/\">Dv8</a>.</p><h2><b>DC New 52</b></h2><p>With the merging of the DC and Wildstorm universe, Team 7 began to appear in the regular DC Universe.

After the roster for Team 7 was finalized, she strictly blamed Lynch for not making the team.

Craven then sends out Team 7 on a blackbag mission to shut down and terminate these supposed experiments. After annihilating everyone within the compound, the team enters the \"lab complex\" only to find nothing but an empty warehouse. The team questions Lynch, but he refuses to believe that Craven has sent them on another bogus mission. Before they are able to figure things out, Lynch hears a type of hissing sound coming from their immediate location. He realizes too late that he doesn't recognize this sound due to the fact that there was no audio on the videotape that he viewed. The entire team drops to the ground, unconscious.</p><p>After awakening from their Gen-factor induced comas, Team 7 was told by Craven that the enemy had dropped a bio-chemical weapon on them. As a result of the Gen-factor, Team 7 (except for Michael Cray) started to develop superhuman powers. Several members of Team 7 were unable to cope or control their new powers and went mad or committed suicide. Cole Cash distrusted Craven and suspected that he was behind the experiment, but Lynch still refuses to believe that their own people would do this to them.</p><p>The team is sent out on another mission, this time to East Africa. During the operation, team member Andrew Johnson begins using his powers in sadistic ways, basking in the glory of his ability to make people kill themselves. His psychotic display of power forces Cash to shoot and kill him in front of Lynch. After a brief argument and stand-off with Cash, Lynch decides to cover up Johnson's murder and doesn't inform the rest of the team what had transpired. After returning to I.O, Craven and Gabriel debrief Lynch and questions him regarding the death of Johnson. He refuses to tell the truth so Gabriel tries to probe his mind causing Lynch to respond angrily.</p><p>Craven sends Team 7 out again on another mission in the desert to take out a supposed nuclear materials rendering facility which is cooking up extra-dirty weapons grade plutonium. Craven orders Cray to sit out this next mission and work support. After arriving on-site, the team locates a large, old run-down monastery causing them to question Lynch yet again. He continues to naively maintain that the operation is legit. Entering the building, Cash and Callahan find nothing but monks (Coptics) inside. As Lynch enters, he is immediately confronted by Cash and they get into an argument then a violent psionic fight ensues between the two with Cash being the subsequent winner. Cray is present on the bridge of the Command Cruiser as Craven gives them the order to launch a low-yield nuclear cruise missile at Team 7. Seeing Cray visibly upset with the decision, Craven orders him arrested so he can not interfere in the operation. Cray overpowers the guards, grabs a shotgun and handgun then takes the Captain of the Cruiser hostage. He then contacts Team 7 over the radio and informs them of the situation. Cash revives Lynch and tells him what Craven has done. Cash comes up with a plan to combine their powers and create a shield to protect them from the nuclear explosion. Minutes later, the missile hits its intended target and the team is engulfed by the detonation. On the Cruiser, Cray waits tensely for several hours to verify that Team 7 survived the blast before releasing the Captain, after which he is beaten down by Marines and thrown into the brig. Team 7 walks out of the blast area barely scathed just as a rescue helicopter locates them. Only Lynch goes back to I.O. while the rest of the team remained behind and eventually go into hiding in Nicaragua.</p><h2>Team 7 - Objective: Hell</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1172441\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63024/1172441-14276196_1_super.jpg\" title=\"Team 7 Objective: Hell #1\"><img id=\"1172441\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63024/1172441-14276196_1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Team 7 Objective: Hell #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Team 7 Objective: Hell #1</div></div></div></div><p>Some time later, Lynch is able to release Cray from prison under the condition that he helps to locate and convince Team 7 to return. Lynch tells Cray that Craven is no longer the Director of I.O. and that a new administration has taken over. Cray accepts and the two locates the team in a South American jungle. Cray and Lynch are able to convince Team 7 to work for I.O. again. They are then sent to destroy a cache of nuclear weapons placed in a hardened bunker (since the Vietnam War) in Cambodia before the Khmer Rouge could acquire them. Unbeknownst to Team 7 however, a Russian PSI-Unit lead by a (Psionically powerful) crippled old man named Rostov, are sent to Cambodia in order to locate and capture them.</p><p>In Cambodia, on the way to Nung Valley via boat, Dane uses his powers to disguise the team as Khmer Rouge. As the Russians arrive, they are hostilely greeted by an army of Khmer Rouge. The leader threatens to shoot Rostov if they don't leave, but the old man uses his mind control powers to force the leader to shoot himself, thereby causing the Rouge to follow his orders. Using a female superhuman named Silver, the Russians are able to track and follow Team 7 through the jungle. Along the way, Team 7 is attacked by supernatural forces, more powerful than the entire team combined. Eventually, they find the source of the attack, a little Cambodian girl with incredible psionic powers named X'ing X'ang who uses her natural abilities to protect her village. After some discussion, she decides to help them locate the cache of missiles which she refers to as \"the house of fire\". Just then, Russian military gunships arrive and a firefight ensues, causing X'ang to use her powers again and create an enormous illusion, which causes the pilots of the helicopters to panic and lose control of their aircraft. Seeing an opening, Callahan uses his \"mojo\" to destroy the remaining gunships when their own guns proved to be ineffective against the helicopters' armor. Lynch orders Cray and Dane to stay behind in order to kill any troops trailing them.</p><p>At X'ang's village, she leads Lynch and Cash to the house of fire while Slayton, Fairchild, Chang and Callahan secure the village. Cray and Dane ambush and kill an entire squad of Khmer Rouge, but Cray is killed by the two Russian superhumans, Silver and Khuchev, while Dane is seriously injured. Using his powers, Dane tries to revive Cray while killing a group of Russian soldiers who come within a few feet of them. X'ang, Lynch and Cash locates the weapon stockpiles and Lynch begins to arm all the destruct codes. Cash states that the missiles aren't what the enemy is after, he believes they're after Team 7. Outside of the bunker, the village is attacked by Silver and Khuchev as Team 7 gets overpowered by the two Russians. After Khuchev kills several fleeing villagers, Slayton goes on the offensive and kills Khuchev with his newly manifested psionic tendrils. Rostov stands over Dane and tries to brainwash him while Dane continues to call out to Cray. Deathblow suddenly awakens moments later, unbeknownst to Rostov. In the village, Silver has completely over-powered Team 7, but X'ang appears, angered at what the Russians have done to her village. She strikes the over-confident Silver with a powerful psionic blast, causing the Russian female to literally explode. Meanwhile, Rostov continues to wipe out Dane's mind, but Cray appears behind him, pointing his gun at the old man's head. Using his mind control powers again, Rostov tries to force Cray to shoot himself, but Cray proves to be too resilient and shoots Rostov in the head, however, Dane is left in a comatose state because of the old man. With the Russians dead and the cache of weapons buried beneath tons of limestone, Team 7 departs and takes X'ing X'iang with them due to the fact that her entire village was destroyed, leaving her as the sole survivor.</p><h2>Team 7: Dead Reckoning</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1172443\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63024/1172443-37473_5875_41981_1_team_7__dead_reckon_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Team 7: Dead Reckoning #1\"><img id=\"1172443\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63024/1172443-37473_5875_41981_1_team_7__dead_reckon_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Team 7: Dead Reckoning #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Team 7: Dead Reckoning #1</div></div></div></div><p>Years later, Team 7 are sent out on a mission to bring in a Soviet scientist named Dbovchek at a secret genetics weapons lab in Leningrad. During the mission, they come into contact with one of the experimental superhumans. Lynch decides to fight him alone while the rest of the team locates Dbovchek. Being overpowered by the superhuman, Lynch literally tears out his left eye and vaporizes the superhuman's head along with the entire of the room. During the extraction, Dbovchek gets killed while Slayton takes charge of the team. After returning to I.O. from the mission, Team 7 discovers that Craven is once again in charge. This infuriates Cash and hell tells Craven that Team 7 is finished. He gets into a small tussle with Slayton then leaves the room. The only members to stay behind are Lynch, Slayton and Cray.</p><p>In a personal mission to avenge his parent's death at the hands of terrorist, Cray assassinates the person who Craven claims is directly responsible, terrorist leader Kadiz Al Dhabi. An unknown amount of time later, Cash enters the Soviet Union on his own to find out more about Dbovchek. He gets captured by the Russians while meeting a contact (who gets killed) and then interrogated. As it turns out, Dbovchek was one of the main scientists behind the Russian psionic program and was planning to defect due to his love for the United States. During the interrogation, Cash discovers that his psionic powers are waning. Just as he is being led outside, John Lynch arrives to rescue him along with Fairchild and Cray.</p><p>Sometime later, Jackson Dane awakens from his coma, under the influence of several failed experimental superhumans (created by I.O.) who have turned into mutants and were imprisoned down in Level 9. They break out of their prisons with Dane's help and Team 7 arrives to try and stop them. Unfortunately, Dane turns out to be far more powerful than the rest of the team combined. Cray eventually brings X'ing X'iang who is able to free Dane's mind. She finds out through Dane that Miles Craven had become interested in the children of Team 7 and is planning to restart Project Genesis. During the chaos, X'ang is captured by I.O. and confined. Immediately after this incident, nearly all the members of Team 7, except for Lynch, Cray and Slayton, take their families and themselves into hiding. This would finally turn out to be the end of the unit.</p><h2>Brothers in Arms</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1179844\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63024/1179844-gw324h506_super.jpg\" title=\"Deathblow #25\"><img id=\"1179844\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63024/1179844-gw324h506_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Deathblow #25\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Deathblow #25</div></div></div></div><p>Due to Craven's terminal illness, he makes an alliance with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spartan/29-12006/\">John Colt</a> (posing as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kaizen-gamorra/29-24905/\">Kaizen Gamorra</a>) and orchestrates a plan to collect the Gen-Factor from the former members of Team 7 and use the extracts to give him a new lease on life. Craven hires the services of Le Gauche and is able to capture Lynch and extract his Gen-Factor. Cray, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alicia-turner/29-54351/\">Alicia Turner</a> and the Gen13 kids travel to San Francisco to rescue Lynch, but most of them get captured. After Lynch escapes his restraints, he tries to use his Gen powers, but is unable to hold it in check and it goes out of control. Cray arrives at the scene and is somehow able to shut it down. Later, they are able to rescue Alicia and the other Gen13 kids. Craven orders Le Gauche to New York in order take Dane's Gen-Factor.</p><p>Cray finds Dane at the Korean War Memorial in Battery Park and tells him of their storied past in Team 7 and what Craven's planning for the remaining members of the team. They visit Dr. Richard Markus, who had previously worked for Craven and I.O., to get answers. At I.O. headquarters, Craven activates the Brethren (a group of Gen-Actives that he specifically created to deal with Team 7) to assist Le Gauche on his next missions. Cray and Dane discover that during Project Genesis, Craven ordered Gabriel Newman to attempt a Gen-Factor extraction on a living subject. While the extraction worked, it left the subject unable to control his powers. Eventually, the subject's molecular structure began to lose its integrity until he completely disintegrated and died. Le Gauche and a member of the Brethren named Jackhammer (Otto Bremer) attack the doctor's office and kill Markus. While Bremer distracts Cray, Le Gauche battles Dane and is eventually able to extract his Gen-Factor, causing his Gen powers to go haywire. After defeating Bremer, Cray finds Dane and is once again able to mysteriously shut down Dane's \"Mojo\". Craven targets Backlash next and proclaims that soon, he'll have the powers of Team 7.</p><p>Another member from the Brethren is introduced to aid Le Gauche and Bremer, her name is Double Take. She's a shapeshifter and Craven plans on using her to flush out Slayton by posing as his former fiancee, Diane Lasalle. Cray and Dane arrive at Jack Rhodes' safehouse and bring him up to speed with the current situation. He receives a call from \"Lasalle\" saying that she's in trouble. Slayton, Dane and Cray travel to the Ticonderoga Station and soon discover that Le Gauche and Bremer have already arrived. Pretending to be Lasalle, Double Take causes Slayton to turn against his friends just as Stormforce troopers arrive, giving the two an opportunity to escape. She takes a surprised Backlash to Le Gauche and subdues him. Upon awakening and strapped to a chair, Slayton finds the real Lasalle tied up in front of him and realizes that he'd been duped. The Brethren then extract his Gen-Factor as Cray and Dane try to break into the room. Lasalle breaks out of her bondage and attacks Double Take and Jackhammer, only to be shot and killed by Le Gauche. Cray and Dane finally breach the door, but the Brethren are able to make their escape. Craven discovers that Alicia Turner has turned against him and decides to use her as bait for Grifter. Another member of the Brethren is introduced, a woman named Tensile.</p><p>Alicia secretly contacts Cash and tells him about the situation with regards to Craven's plans and Project Renaissance. She is discovered by the Brethren and Double Take uses her powers to pose as Alicia. Arriving at Cash's home, Cray and Dane are attacked by I.O.'s Black Razors. They are told by one of the surviving soldiers that Le Gauche is planning to ambush Cash at Union Station. \"Alicia\" meets Cash at the train station, but he immediately realizes that it isn't her. A fight ensues between Cash and the Brethren, but ultimately he's subdued and they extract his Gen-Factor. Cray shoots Double Take and kills her seconds before she is about to shoot Cash. The Police arrive and the Brethren uses the distraction to make their escape. Later at I.O. HQ, Craven receives all the Gen-Factor extracts and places it into a Cryo-case to have Le Gauche deliver it to Gamorra. He then contacts Kaizen, who tells him that Project Renaissance is ready to begin.</p><p>Cray, Dane and Cash infiltrate a biological warfare research facility in order to find Gabriel Newman, who's been held prisoner by Craven. Gabriel discloses all the information he knows, including how Cray's father is the one responsible for bringing <a href=\"about:/dr-tsung/29-23671/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Simon Tsung</a>to America. He also tells them information regarding Project Renaissance. As soon as the three depart, Gabriel commits suicide with the gun that Cray left for him. Later, Cray, Dane, Cash and Slayton rendezvous with Lynch and Gen13 near I.O. headquarters in McLean, Virginia to take the fight to Craven. Craven contacts Kaizen and activates Project Renaissance then begins downloading his consciousness into a clone (created by Kaizen) called the Gen Omega. Team 7 and Gen13 infiltrate the base via an underground tunnel system, but are stopped by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frank-colby/29-65117/\">Frank Colby</a>. He surprisingly helps them enter the complex, but the Brethren had already suspected it and laid out an ambush using Black Hammers. During the ensuing firefight, the group splits up. Colby and Gen13 locate and rescue Alicia, while Team 7 hunts down Craven. During a surprise ambush by the Brethren, Cray is shot and \"killed\", but revives moments later, to everyone's surprise. With the help of Gen13, Alicia and Colby, they are able to take down the Brethren and the group of Black Hammers. Lynch tells Colby to get the children out while they deal with Craven. Team 7 then confronts Craven who tells them that they should all be grateful for what he's done and finally tells Cray the truth about his parent's death. Because Admiral Cray decided to help Dr. Tsung escape I.O., Craven had him killed by passing his assassination off as a terrorist attack. In actuality, it was Le Gauche, posing as a terrorist, who killed Cray's parents. The only other person who knew the truth, was terrorist leader Kadiz Al Dhabi, whom Cray assassinated in the pages of <strong>Team 7: Dead Reckoning</strong>. Lynch blames Craven for losing his wife and son, Slayton blames Craven for Laselle's death and Dane blames him for the death of his Wetworks team mates, Flattop and Crossbones.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Cyberforce is a superhero team consisting mostly of mutants. The mutants were experimented on and gained cybernetic implants which granted them new and improved powers. The team consists of:</p><ul><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ballistic/29-41824/\">Ballistic</a>:</b> Cassandra Lane, who is the older sister of Velocity. Her mutant powers grant her superhuman aim, making her an excellent markswoman.</li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyblade/29-24467/\">Cyblade</a>:</b> Born in the European country of Chalenne, Dominique Thiebaut's history is shrouded in mystery. Her mutant powers give her the ability to generate blades of electromagnetic energy.</li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heatwave/29-44424/\">Heatwave</a>:</b> Dylan Cruise has the ability to absorb solar energy and use it both for offensive purposes, as well as flight. A former Navy SEAL, the military man Dylan Cruise has clashed often with the guerrilla fighter Stryker.</li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/impact/29-41849/\">Impact</a>:</b> Boomer O'Shea was the muscle of Cyberforce. He died during one of Cyberforce's adventures. His death reminded his teammates that they must continue their heroism.</li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ripclaw/29-26501/\">Ripclaw</a>:</b> A Native-American mutant with limited shape shifting. During one of his adventures he was cloned, and the clone was used as a villain during some plotlines.</li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stryker/29-21923/\">Stryker</a>:</b> Major Morgan Striker was gravely injured during one of his missions. Cyberdata found his torn body and gave Stryker three fully functional cybernetic arms and replaced his right eye and ear with new ones.</li><li><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/velocity/29-9151/\">Velocity</a>:</b> The younger sister of Ballistic, Carin Taylor is a mutant with superhuman speed. She's recently begun a relationship with Ripclaw.</li></ul><p>The members of Cyberforce were all captured by an enormous corporation bent on world domination named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyberdata/65-51776/\">Cyberdata</a>. Cyberdata was run by various scientists who experimented on the captured mutants. The scientists had developed a new technology, known by acronym S.H.O.C., or Special Hazardous Operation Cyborg. They applied the new technology on the mutants, enhancing their powers, but damaging them mentally. The experimented mutants had had enough and escaped the clutches of Cyberdata. They then banded together to form Cyberforce, with their primary goal being the takedown of Cyberdata.</p><p>During the events of the CyberForce/Hunter Killer crossover, Ellis returns after two years of wandering and learning about the Earth and it's people. Uncovering a plot by Morningstar and his new partners, Cyberdata, he arrives too late to prevent a skirmish between the Hunter Killer team and CyberForce. Morningstar fed the HK team false information that CyberForce was really a rogue group of Ultra Sapiens. After breaking up the fight and having Architect save Heatwave's life, the teams agree to work together to stop Morningstar. They split into 3 teams, with the purpose of hitting 3 targets simultaneously. The heroes are outmaneuvered by their opponents and there serious injuries to Architect and Cloak and several members are captured. Confronting Morningstar, the remaining heroes are able to free their comrades and stop Cyberdata from unleashing a viral signal that would effectively turn a large portion of the general population into Ultra Sapiens, who would have no idea how to control their newfound powers. They accomplished this by killing one of their own, Network, and installing Damper into the system that broadcasts the U-S virus. CyberForce member Velocity is infected w/ the virus, and after the conflict, Ellis joins CyberForce to help keep her new situation in check. Heatwave joins the HK team to keep an eye on them.</p>",

Adam chose to separate the gems from the Infinity Gauntlet, allowing the Living Tribunal to set forth a law that the gems would never again be allowed to work together in unison. Adam then set about delivering the gems to six individuals he felt could be worthy guardians. Each guardian was selected for their ability to guard their gem without misusing it's power. Although Adam selected the guardians of the gem while possessing the Infinity Gauntlet and was, presumably, omniscient, they were considered, especially by <a href=\"/eternity/29-11332/\">Eternity</a>, to be completely inappropriate choices.</p><h2><b><u>Team Roster</u></b></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"650772\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25705/650772-sc00095702_super.jpg\" title=\"Giving Up Being God\"><img id=\"650772\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25705/650772-sc00095702_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Giving Up Being God\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Giving Up Being God</div></div></div></div><p>Adam kept the <a href=\"/soul-gem/18-55645/\">soul gem</a> for himself, having worn it for several years.</p><p><a href=\"/drax-the-destroyer/29-6807/\">Drax the Destroyer</a> was given the <a href=\"/power-gem/18-55644/\">power gem</a>. The gem's power enhanced his already formidable strength and durability, making him a formidable guardian. Drax's limited intelligence at the time made him unlikely to abuse the gem's power. Drax swallowed the gem, keeping it in his stomach.</p><p>The <a href=\"/time-gem/18-57126/\">time gem</a> was given to <a href=\"/gamora/29-6806/\">Gamora</a>, one of Adam's allies from previous times. Gamora's strength and skill as an assasin made her an effective guardian, while her lack of knowledge or training made her unlikely to abuse the gem's power.</p><p>Adam gave the <a href=\"/mind-gem/18-57129/\">mind gem</a> to <a href=\"/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a>, Drax's daughter, although Drax had no memory of their relationship. Moondragon seemed like an especially questionable choice considering her troubled past. However, the mind gem significantly increased Moondragon's powers and skills, making her a formidable protector for the gem.</p><p>The <a href=\"/space-gem/18-57127/\">space gem</a> went to <a href=\"/pip/29-13782/\">Pip</a> the troll, another long time companion of Adam's. Pip's self serving and devious personality made him another questionable choice, although his limited understanding of how to use the space gem helped ensure he wouldn't abuse it's powers</p><p>Originally the guardian of the <a href=\"/reality-gem/18-57128/\">reality gem</a> was a secret, known only to Adam and a few cosmic powers. Eventually <a href=\"/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> was revealed as the possessor of the gem. Thanos's power made him an effective guardian for the reality gem, and he was wise enough to understand it was too dangerous to use. Considering Thanos had only recently attempted to use the Infinity Gems to conquer the universe, Eternity found his choice especially unacceptable.</p><h2><b><u>Beginnings</u></b></h2><p>After giving the gems to the team, Warlock departed from them, weary from becoming mortal once again after relinquishing his godhood. The team all went their separate ways. Adam Warlock went to receive some help from the High Evolutionary, who had helped him previously with a similar situation. He found the High Evolutionary seriously mentally diminished. He and his men were also being hunted by a group with extremely advanced technology. This group also sought out the other members of the Infinity Watch. Drax, Pip, Moondragon and Gamora were all captured.</p><p>The culprit behind the plot turned out to be none other than one of Adam's greatest foes, the <a href=\"/man-beast/29-14524/\">Man-Beast</a>. He dared not use the power of the gems directly but instead created a giant energy monster with the power of the gems he had captured. Adam went to rescue his teammates but was completely overpowered by the creature. He did manage to fool it into destroying the ship which carried them, and Man-Beast escaped. Luckily for Adam, he was saved at the last moment by his teammates when the ship crashed on Earth. After this, they determined it may be best for them to remain together as a group.</p><p>The team settled on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/monster-island/34-55862/\">Monster Island</a>, home of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mole-man/29-2481/\">Mole Man</a> and his subjects. The team came to an agreement with Mole Man, helping bolster his claim to the island while he provided a castle for their use.</p><h2>Infinity War</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"839287\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/839287-bigwar1_super.jpg\" title=\"The Showdown\"><img id=\"839287\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/839287-bigwar1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Showdown\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Showdown</div></div></div></div><p>When the <a href=\"/magus/29-14619/\">Magus</a> returned and planned to rule all the universe, it was Thanos who came to the Infinity Watch for assistance. Together they followed the source of the energies through dimensions. But, Magus had made it seem as though Thanos and Adam Warlock were the culprits behind the entire scheme. When Earth's heroes arrived at the same place as the Watch, they were attacked. This was all part of the Magus' plan. The battle was stopped by <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>, who read all of their minds and thus gave them all the truth.</p><p>Thanos convinced Warlock that there was only one way to defeat the Magus - return the gems to the gauntlet. Warlock reluctantly did this, but the Living Tribunal and Eternity had removed the gems power when together. This was also part of the Magus' plan and he teleported in and kidnapped Warlock. Magus was in possession of the gauntlet when Galactus and Gamora revived Eternity and thus restored the gauntlet's power.</p><p>But the gauntlet was not complete, and Magus was deceived by Warlock and Thanos. Warlock defeated Magus and trapped him in the Soul World, but Warlock himself was placed in a catatonic state. This left the team without a leader and threatened to split them up. Gamora tried to keep them all together and was successful long enough for Adam Warlock to come out of his sleep.</p><h2>Infinity Crusade</h2><p>The team was split when the <a href=\"/goddess/29-9477/\">Goddess</a> began the <a href=\"/infinity-crusade/39-42235/\">Infinity Crusade</a>. She was able to control Gamora and Moondragon into becoming part of her <a href=\"/holy-guard/65-56621/\">Holy Guard</a>. With only Pip, Drax and Maxam remaining, Pip saw this as his chance to become a leader, but this was not as successful as he had hoped. The remaining members fought with Earth's heroes while Adam Warlock once again teamed with Thanos. Warlock put much trust in Thanos and this was proven to be the correct decision in the end. Warlock was able to break the control of the Goddess over the other heroes and defeat her. The Watch was reunited, but once again it was Warlock who took the blame from everyone over the dangers to the universe.</p><h2>Back on Earth</h2><p>After the Infinity Crusade, the team returned to Monster Island. After an attack by <a href=\"/count-abyss/29-26110/\">Count Abyss</a>, the team found a man with amnesia washed ashore named <a href=\"/maxam/29-25624/\">Maxam</a>. He could not remember anything but instantly attacked Adam Warlock on sight. He didn't know why and even though Gamora had seen a vision of him from the Time Gem killing Adam, he was allowed to remain with the team.</p><p>Monster Island was invaded several times by the <a href=\"/united-nations/65-57235/\">United Nations</a> who believed Warlock and the Watch to be a threat, especially since they were in league with the Mole Man. It wasn't until after Warlock exposed Senator Kyle Munson as the evil Man Beast that the United Nations allowed the team to remain on the island undisturbed.</p><p>Count Abyss finally made his attack, sending his consort <a href=\"/maya/29-26109/\">Maya</a> to Monster Island with a story of becoming their allies in battle against Abyss. Adam was fooled and drank a 'customary' toast to their partnership. This spirit they drank was a powerful love potion that caused Adam and Maya to fall desperately in love. Abyss quickly captured Maya and forced the team to travel to his dimension to retrieve her. Once there, Abyss showed the ability to control their gems and use them against the team, simultaneously defeating all of them with the incredible power he possessed in his own realm. The Infinity Watch was captured and taken prisoner and the Soul Gem taken into his possession. With the help of <a href=\"/darklore/29-26111/\">Darklore</a> and <a href=\"/meerlyn/29-63433/\">Meer'Lyn</a>, Adam was able to escape (the remainder of the team in no shape for battle) and defeat Abyss, allowing the team to return back to their own dimension.</p>",

They become trapped on the distant planet of Adon after the apparent death of Infinity Man, with whom they have switched places. There they establish a city, called Forevertown, and become used to life on the planet, though one team member, Vykin, dies soon after arrival. They encounter an entity known as the Dark, which takes control of Serifan and wreaks havoc on Adon until defeated by the remaining Forever People. After this battle, everything that has happened to the team while on Adon, including the death of Vykin, the births of a number of children and two marriages, is erased from existence. After this the team again takes residence on Earth.</p><h3>Death of the New Gods</h3><p>Prior to the events of the <a href=\"/death-of-the-new-gods/39-48489/\">Death of the New Gods</a>, all of the members of the Forever People were murdered by Infinity Man.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Amalgam Universe</h3><p>A version of the Forever People appeared in the <a href=\"/amalgam-comics/57-2014/\">Amalgam Universe</a>, as a team called the <a href=\"/un-people/65-57063/\">Un-People</a>, which is a fusion of the Forever People and the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a>.

Both teams worked together to eventually defeat the Badoon's oppressive regime.</p><p>The Defenders returned to their own time period while the Guardians and other surviving rebels of the war rebuilt their civilization. The Guardians eventually left Earth as space explorers and adventurers and recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nikki/29-13897/\">Nikki</a> along the way. During these adventures, the Guardians learned that the Silver Surfer prevented the Badoon invasion of Earth in the 20th Century.

The Guardians had followed Korvac to the 20th Century and fought side by side with that era's mightiest heroes, the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, against Korvac. The Guardians were all granted honorary Avengers membership after this event.</p><p>After staying in the 20th Century for some time, the Guardians continued to have various adventures with other heroes such as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>. Vance Astro even met his younger self (actually parallel counterpart) and inadvertently unleashed young Vance's own latent psychic abilities.</p><p>This results in young Vance Astrovik in walking a path different from Vance Astro. Young Vance grows up to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice/29-4811/\">Justice</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">New Warriors</a> and later the Avengers. The Guardians eventually returned to their own time period and decide to embark on a quest to recover Captain America's lost <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-americas-shield/18-50737/\">shield</a>. This <a href=\"/quest-for-the-shield/39-55833/\">quest for the shield</a> sets the stage for significant events in the lives of the Guardians. After finding Captain America's shield, Vance Astro was able to safely remove his life-preserving suit and change into a different uniform. Vance changed his name as well to Major Victory.</p><p>The group also acquired a few more members such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firelord/29-7108/\">Firelord</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/replica/29-26121/\">Replica</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hollywood/29-25860/\">Hollywood</a> (Earth-691 Wonder Man), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/talon/29-15993/\">Talon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rita-demara/29-1501/\">Yellowjacket</a> (Rita DeMara from Earth-616). Martinex took a leave of absence from the group to form the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactic-guardians/65-56284/\">Galactic Guardians</a> in an effort to expand the Guardians operations. He recruited Firelord, Replica, Mainframe (Earth-691 <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spirit-of-vengeance/29-26120/\">Spirit of Vengeance</a>, Hollywood and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-ix/29-26122/\">Phoenix IX</a>.</p><p>The Galactic Guardians completed several missions before Martinex eventually returned to the Guardians of the Galaxy. By the end of this series, Starhawk, Firelord, Replica, Talon and Yellowjacket had left the group for their own reasons and the remaining Guardians embarked on another mission in the past.</p><p>The series ended with the group composed of Charlie-27, Nikki, Major Victory, Martinex, Aleta, Yondu and Hollywood. The Guardians make their most recent appearance with this lineup in New Warriors vol 1 #68. No sign of the Guardians has been seen since until Major Victory and Starhawk suddenly appears in the second volume of the Guardians of the Galaxy series. No indication as to the whereabouts of the other Guardians.</p><h3>Earth-616 Guardians of the Galaxy</h3><p>The Guardians of the Galaxy of the mainstream Marvel reality has recently been formed after the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilation-conquest/39-44982/\">Annihilation Conquest</a>. The previous lineup is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-warlock/29-6805/\">Adam Warlock</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/drax-the-destroyer/29-6807/\">Drax the Destroyer</a>, Quasar (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phyla/29-40922/\">Phyla</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gamora/29-6806/\">Gamora</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starlord/29-10957/\">Starlord</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mantis/29-3324/\">Mantis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/groot/29-24341/\">Groot</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rocket-raccoon/29-32814/\">Rocket Raccoon</a>. After a Skrull infiltration of their headquarters on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/knowhere/34-49201/\">Knowhere</a>, it was revealed to the Guardians that Mantis had been asked by Peter Quill to use her mind-control powers on the team's members in order to help the team function better.</p><p>As a result of this news Phyla together with Drax go in search of Moondragon, Warlock accompanied by Gamora leaves the group and Star-lord also leaves which in turn brought Mantis &amp; Groot to have been moved to active status &amp; the team is lead by Rocket Raccoon. The current lineup of The Guardians Of The Galaxy is Rocket Raccoon, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/groot/29-24341/\">Groot</a>, Mantis, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bug/29-5049/\">Bug</a>, &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/major-victory/29-2166/\">Major Victory</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Star-Lord heads to Hala to see if the warning signal he gave went through to Ronan only to be sent to the Negative Zone by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a>. Star-Lord comes across <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blastaar/29-10963/\">Blastaar</a> and is enslaved so he can be used to make the personnel at 42 to surrender as he plans on invading earth but he thwarts his plan and brings back <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-flag/29-25687/\">Jack Flag</a> with him.</p><p>Meanwhile The Guardians are fighting off the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/badoon/65-22907/\">Badoon</a> from a colony and learn from Major Victory that the Badoon in his timeline conquered the Human race, Drax and Phyla are looking for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cammi/29-41747/\">Cammi</a> but instead find out <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> is still alive and eventually go to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mentor/29-14522/\">Mentor</a> to see if he can help them but he kills them instead stating \"It was absolutely essential\". Adam Warlock and Gamora went to find the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matriarch/29-14622/\">Matriarch</a> and tell her that she is their Messiah and will prove it by stopping the war that is coming.</p><p>After Mentor kills Drax and Phyla they are found on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oblivion/29-2496/\">Oblivion</a> where Phyla loses her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quantum-bands/18-42361/\">Quantam Bands</a> and Drax infers that they are dead after learning this development. They are quickly ambushed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maelstrom/29-2493/\">Maelstrom</a> and Phyla was fed to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dragon-of-the-moon/29-56928/\">Dragon of the Moon</a>, but before Drax was fed, Wendell Vaughn (aka: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>) comes to rescue him and fights off Maelstrom as Phyla bursts out of the Dragons belly with Heather but made the deal to be Deaths avatar.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>Upon learning of the upcoming war between the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar Empire</a>, with their new Emperor <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vulcan/29-21233/\">Vulcan</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a>, now led by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> and their King <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>. All of the Guardians reunite and are joined by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-flag/29-25687/\">Jack Flag</a> who returns with Star-lord from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">Negative Zone</a>.</p><p>The Guardians split into two teams in an attempt to talk the Inhumans and the Shi'ar out of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/war-of-kings/39-55758/\">War of Kings</a>, but both were unsuccessful. This led to both attacking the Guardians on Knowhere. During the skirmish, the Guardian's prisoner, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starhawk/29-2168/\">Starhawk</a>, is able to escape. She (having changed genders because of time travel) takes several of the Guardians to her future to show them the dangers the war will have on the universe.</p><p>Starhawk's future is a bleak one. As a result of the War of Kings, a massive, expanding fissure is opened known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-fault/34-56597/\">Fault</a>. The Guardians meet the future Guardians (similar to the 691 Guardians, composed of Starhawk, Martinex, Charlie-27, Yondu and Vance Astro) who live in a small bubble of a universe since the Fault has consumed their universe. They are all that remains besides the Badoon, who have taken over the remainder of the universe.</p><p>Starhawk explains that the Fault is caused by Black Bolt and had brought them there to prove the damage she had earlier claimed. With their time machine destroyed, the only hope is to send a message back to the past to warn the other Guardians. The Badoon attack and they make a plan to send their message. The Badoon had enslaved the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> and made them into what they called the 'Celestial Engine' which protects the remainder of the universe from the Fault. They planned to relay a message to one of the Celestials who could then send the message to Knowhere.</p><p>They are able to relay their message and this causes the Celestials to break their alignment. The 691 Guardians say their goodbyes and the others wonder if this is truly the end, for this future has nothing left to save. Instead of being obliterated, this causes the 616 Guardians to be sent adrift in time. It also causes them to age strangely, with the exception of Jack Flag, who seems to be fading from existence.</p><p>They arrive in another distant future with a new set of Guardians (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/killraven/29-7233/\">Killraven</a>, Charlie-27, Nikki, Hollywood and Starhawk). This future is extremely similar to War of the Worlds, and the Guardians protect and supply the survivors from the extermination of Martian invaders. Starhawk is sent the information on what is happening from the other versions of himself. With this information, they are able to form a plan to return the Guardians to their own time and a way for the future Guardians to defeat the Martians.</p><p>Hollywood had spoken of the advanced weaponry of the Avengers located under the mansion, but the Martian Command Node was blocking the entrance like a force field. Since Jack Flag was diluted, this gave him the ability to pass through it. Once inside, the future Guardians had all the weapons they needed to defeat Earth's attackers. But before the other Guardians could use the time machine, they slipped through time once again.</p><p>The team fell through several alternate futures before arriving at one ruled by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magus/29-14619/\">Magus</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-church-of-truth/65-54776/\">Universal Church of Truth</a>. While being attacked by the followers of the Church, they were rescued by an unlikely ally: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kang/29-2264/\">Kang the Conqueror</a>. He took them to limbo, where he had an army of Starhawk's from destroyed realities assisting him. He explained that Adam Warlock would become the Magus and all possible futures were becoming Magus futures. He gave Starlord a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a> and sent them back to their own time, moments before Adam's transformation.</p><p>They arrive at the right time, but it is too late. In order to stop the expansion of the Fault, Adam had overlapped time with an unused future, the one in which he became the Magus. Once transformed, all the Guardians engaged him, to which the Magus seemed to have no problem in handling all of them. Starlord was able to turn Magus back into Adam Warlock, but only briefly. At Adam's request, the only was to stop the Magus was to kill him, which Starlord regrettably did.</p><p>The battle was costly and Adam was not the only member of the team to be lost. In battle with the Magus, several other members lost their lives fighting him, including Mantis, Cosmo, Major Victory, Gamora, and Phyla. They returned to Knowhere, having paid a high price for their victory. Magus, however, survived the battle. He faked his own death at the hands of Starlord to by time for his plan to create the Fault. He also faked the deaths of Mantis, Cosmo, Major Victory, Gamora, and Phyla. While trying to escape, Phyla unwittingly opens a cocoon containing <a href=\"/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a>, to take back his rightful place as the Avatar of Death. Thanos kills Phyla but is defeated and captured by the remaining Guardians with the help of the Cosmic Cube.</p><h3>The Thanos Imperative</h3><p>After the Magus detonates a multitude of the Church's planets to open the Fault, the Guardians and Thanos form an uneasy alliance. They all travel to the <a href=\"/the-cancerverse/34-56640/\">Cancerverse</a>, the Fault-connected universe currently invading the theirs under the leadership of a corrupted <a href=\"/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Mar-Vell</a>. The Guardians show off their might by defeating the <a href=\"/defenders-of-the-realm/65-57565/\">Defenders of the Realm</a>, corrupted versions of the most powerful heroes of Earth, but the Cancerverse is void of <a href=\"/death/29-12620/\">Death</a> and they regenerate. Thanos is able to kill them since he is the Avatar of Death. They then join together with the <a href=\"/the-machine-resistance/65-57704/\">Machine Resistance</a> and learn the true goal of Lord Mar-Vell: turn their universe into another Cancerverse.</p><p>They learn of the <a href=\"/the-necropsy-rite-sanctuary/34-57070/\">Necropsy Site</a> where Death was originally killed, but But Thanos seemingly betrays the team, offering himself to Mar-Vell while the Guardians have their hands full with the <a href=\"/revengers/65-57152/\">Revengers</a>. As he is being killed, Death appears and destroys him. After this, she begins the destruction of the Cancerverse. The Guardians are teleported away in the nick of time, but Starlord along with <a href=\"/nova/29-2105/\">Nova</a> remains behind to ensure Thanos does not escape, sacrificing themselves for the greater good of the universe. When all is said and done, the team has lost Adam Warlock, Phyla Vell, Drax and their leader, Peter Quill, the Starlord.</p><h3>Earth-9997 Guardians of the Galaxy</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"638627\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/638627-gotg_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"638627\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/638627-gotg_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Having traveled accidentally traveled to Earth-9997 from a future nearly identical to that of Earth-691, the Guardians (Vance Astro, Martinex, Charlie-27, Starhawk and Yondu) injured <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watcher/29-7120/\">Uatu</a> and began interrogating <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/machine-man/29-7242/\">X-51</a>, demanding to know why the world was the way it was.

Those who betray the Maggia get murdered,often by a death-grip to the chin named \"The Maggia Touch\". the three main gangs live in New York the Silvermane family, the Hammerhead family and the Nefaria family. The Silvermanes are an original-structured crime network controlling the narcotics trade. The Hammerheads are styled in fashion of 1920s gangsters, and are lead by the flat-topped Hammerhead. The Nefarias, lead by Count Nefaria, are the most colourful of the three families, recruiting costumed criminals to further their plans.

At first, they were the new Justice League of America, but Lord quickly expanded their scope internationally, working with the UN to build the Justice League International! The first members were; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guy-gardner/29-1791/\">Guy Gardner</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ted-kord/29-2054/\">Blue Beetle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-fate/29-5898/\">Dr. Fate</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-2350/\">Captain Marvel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-miracle/29-5703/\">Mr. Miracle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-canary/29-1689/\">Black Canary</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a>, and <a href=\"/dr-light/29-7655/\">Dr. Light</a>, with <a href=\"/oberon/29-10190/\">Oberon</a>, Mr. Miracle's associate, providing support. Eventually, the likes of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/booster-gold/29-1786/\">Booster Gold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-atom/29-2050/\">Captain Atom</a>, <a href=\"/rocket-red/29-2385/\">Rocket Red</a>, <a href=\"/hawkman/29-8337/\">Hawkman</a>, <a href=\"/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">Hawkgirl</a>, <a href=\"/ice/29-2051/\">Ice</a> and <a href=\"/fire/29-4439/\">Fire</a> among many others, would join the ranks. Lead by Martian Manhunter, who was elected to the post, they battled evil across international borders, while forming a familial atmosphere...you know, the kind with fights.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Justice League International was created by <a href=\"/jm-dematteis/26-41043/\">J.M. DeMatteis</a>, <a href=\"/keith-giffen/26-6536/\">Keith Giffen</a>, and <a href=\"/kevin-maguire/26-1785/\">Kevin Maguire</a>, and first appeared in <a href=\"/justice-league/49-3796/\">Justice League #1</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1274242\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10369/1274242-jli_super.jpg\" title=\"The New Justice League International\"><img id=\"1274242\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10369/1274242-jli_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The New Justice League International\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The New Justice League International</div></div></div></div><p>The team would later disband and be replaced by a newly reformed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League of America</a>. This all-star heavy hitter lineup of the Justice League would become the norm and most of the JLI would remain inactive and on the reserve list.</p><p>Many of the characters were involved in the build up to <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a>, most notably seeing Ted Kord killed at the hands of Maxwell Lord, who was using the resources of <a href=\"/checkmate/65-40521/\">Checkmate</a> to attack the metahuman community. He was eventually killed by <a href=\"/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>.</p><p>When Maxwell Lord returns during <a href=\"/brightest-day/39-56018/\">Brightest Day</a>, an international manhunt is started for him. Maxwell Lord wipes everyone in the world's mind of him, except the old Justice League International; Booster Gold, Captain Atom, Fire, and Ice. They are later joined by the new Rocket Red and <a href=\"/blue-beetle/29-4438/\">Blue Beetle</a> and form a new Justice League International.</p><p>In the <a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">New 52</a>, the JLI is formed as a direct reaction to the formation of the Justice League, and is a wholly separate and independent entity. Batman is involved with the team initially, although he ultimately disapproves of their close ties to the UN.</p><h2>Story Arc</h2><p>Formed out of the gathering of heroes at the end of <a href=\"/legends/39-40775/\">Legends</a>, and overshadowed by the tragic end of the previous Leauge, this new League gathered in the <a href=\"/happy-harbor/34-56587/\">Cave at Happy Harbor</a>. Maxwell Lord made moves to take control of this League, and eventually succeeded, offering his organizational skills and brokering a deal, giving the Justice League official UN sanction, and a more international scope. The Justice League International was heavily involved in the <a href=\"/millennium/39-40776/\">Millennium</a> and <a href=\"/invasion/39-40774/\">Invasion!</a> events, and successfully defeated a number of threats, including <a href=\"/despero/29-9548/\">Despero</a>. The League grew, opening up a major <a href=\"/justice-league-europe/65-41040/\">European branch</a>, and embassies around the world. After the events of <a href=\"/break-downs/39-56244/\">Break Downs</a>, the teams were restructured, with <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Green Lantern</a> each taking the reigns of a team. After the <a href=\"/death-of-superman/39-41233/\">Death</a> and <a href=\"/reign-of-the-supermen/39-56339/\">Return of Superman</a>, there was significant disorganization, eventually coming to a head during <a href=\"/judgment-day/39-56374/\">Judgment Day</a>. Following that the team severed it's ties to the UN, with distinct, loosely affiliated teams continuing on, including Captain Atom's <a href=\"/extreme-justice/65-25040/\">Extreme Justice</a>, Martian Manhunter's training team <a href=\"/justice-league-task-force/65-25003/\">Justice League Task Force</a>, and Wonder Woman heading up the more traditional <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League America</a>.</p><p>Some time later, after Ted Kord's death at the hands of Maxwell Lord, and Lord's subsequent death and resurrection at the end of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blackest-night/39-55766/\">Blackest Night</a>. The world and superhero community was left with terror knowing that he is once again free, and his motives unclear. An international manhunt is enacted and all members of the hero community are working together to find and catch Lord. Old members of the Justice League International get involved with the investigation and meet up in response to a distress call from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/booster-gold/29-1786/\">Booster</a>, who found Lord by himself. Lord mind wipes the entire world, sparing only Booster Gold, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-atom/29-2050/\">Captain Atom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fire/29-4439/\">Fire</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ice/29-2051/\">Ice</a>. The foursome are later joined by the new incarnations of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rocket-red/29-2385/\">Rocket Red</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-beetle/29-4438/\">Blue Beetle</a>. While the rest of the hero community does not even know who Maxwell Lord is, the newly re-founded JLI travels around the world looking for him. <a href=\"../../power-girl/29-4915/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Girl</a> and <a href=\"../../dick-grayson/29-1691/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman</a> (Dick Grayson) begin to become suspicious and discover the truth, only to lose it again due to Lord's mind wiping. The JLI is attacked by the <a href=\"../../creature-commandos/65-55577/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creature Commandos</a> and Blue Beetle is captured by Lord, who had used the attack as a decoy. After the Attack on the JLI embassy in Australia the team went to Japan to track down Max Lord and find Blue Beetle. Blue Beetle was on a ship where Max Lord was looking for a weakness in his armor to kill him. Freeing himself, Blue Beetle attacked Max Lord and Lord shot Blue Beetle in the head, reminiscent of Ted Kord's death. Lord escaped, with Beetle seemingly dead. Back in the U.S. JLI embassy the team was sad that they lost there friend Blue Beetle. Suddenly, Blue Beetle woke up and told the team that he knows what Max Lord was doing. Power Girl and Batman joined the team, having defeated the mind wipe. Batman takes the team to see the new Wonder Women and informs her that she is the target of an army of OMAC soldiers lead by OMAC Prime sent by Max Lord. In the fray, Booster Gold defeats Max Lord. Max teleports away, saying it has only just begun... Max Lord appears TV and apologizes for all the destruction he caused. Bruce Wayne (once again holding the mantle of the Bat) reforms the Justice League International with the new and old members of the team.</p>",

Tanner allowed the creature to go into his mind, pretending that he would help the creature save the world, but during this time he actually dove into the creature's mind as well and rewired it to make it vulnerable to the Engineer, who was now on the surface of the moon, investigating Harry's disappearance. Harry gets the better of the Scourge, but not before the Scourge sent pieces of the moon flying towards Earth. Apollo is dispatched and destroys most of them, but one gets past and is revealed to be a monster. The team proceeds to fight the monster and even though most of the team was absorbed, Midnighter, Apollo and the Projectionist saved them. Then half of the team ventured into a lost city to find an ancient alchemy power stone, which was powered by Jenny Quantum and used to change the monster into glass.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h2>Other Media</h2>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Defenders was a team of heroes first brought together by circumstance. The initial membership included <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Strange</a>, the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>, <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> the Submariner, and the <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Surfer</a>. It all started when Dr. Strange gathered the Hulk, Namor, and the Silver Surfer to stop <a href=\"../../yandroth/29-11366/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yandroth</a>'s evil machine.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>A proto-Defenders non-group called the Titans Three first appeared in Sub-Mariner #35, written by Roy Thomas and drawn by Sal Buscema. It consisted of Namor, The Hulk, and The Silver Surfer who banded together to destroy an experimental weather changing device. Roy Thomas also wrote the first official appearance of the Defenders, with Ross Andru doing the pencils and Bill Everett doing the inks, for Marvel Feature #1 in 1971. This team consisted of Namor, The Hulk, The Silver Surfer and Doctor Strange.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Throughout the life of the Defenders, the team line-up has been quite fluid with members. There were always a number of core members who had extended stays such as <a href=\"/nighthawk/29-4832/\">Nighthawk</a>, <a href=\"/patsy-walker/29-3316/\">Hellcat</a>, <a href=\"/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"/starlight/29-19931/\">Red Guardian</a>, or <a href=\"../../valkyrie/29-6809/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valkyrie</a>, and others who only joined for one or two adventures at a time.</p><p><b>New Defenders</b></p><p>A formally organized team of mostly new members, except for Beast, Gargoyle, and Valkyrie. This team ended after a climactic battle against the <a href=\"/dragon-of-the-moon/29-56928/\">Dragon of the Moon</a>.</p><p><b>Secret Defenders</b></p><p>Doctor Strange was the only set member of this team. He would recruit heroes with specific skills for specific missions.</p><p><b>Defenders (2001)</b> &amp; <a href=\"/the-order/49-9496/\"><b>The Order</b></a></p><p>Kurt Busiek and Erik Larsen's take on the team, featured many of the regular Defenders from the first series. They come together again to fight Yandroth and become cursed. In The Order mini-series, the original Defenders served as the antagonists, who decide to take over the world for its own good.</p><p><b>Defenders (2005)</b></p><p>A more tongue and cheek take on the Defenders by Keith Giffen, J.M. DeMatteis and Kevin Maguire, that featured the original members taking on Dormamuu, yet again.</p><p><b>New Jersey Defenders</b></p><p><a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a>, the head of <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>, recruited Nighthawk to be the leader of the New Jersey branch Initiative, calling them the Defenders. The other members of his team included <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> and the <a href=\"/blazing-skull/29-41879/\">Blazing Skull</a>. A New Jersey team was required because the proximity to New York demanded more experienced heroes than those recruited fresh out of <a href=\"/camp-hammond/34-42789/\">Camp Hammond</a>. Their first mission was to battle the Sons of the Serpents, who were busy summoning the god <a href=\"/quetzalcoatl/29-38608/\">Quetzalcoatl</a> in Trump Plaza. The mission did not fare well and the team was disbanded on the grounds of incompetence.</p><p><a href=\"../../last-defenders/65-51326/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Last Defenders</b></a></p><p>Since then, however, Nighthawk has gone on to gather a team outside the <a href=\"/the-initiative/65-42781/\">Initiative</a> consisting of himself, She-Hulk, Hellstorm, and <a href=\"/krang/29-13401/\">Krang</a>, and calling themselves the Last Defenders. This team operated for a short time before being disbanded by <a href=\"/hammer/65-56065/\">H.A.M.M.E.R</a>. It also showed a possible future of Nighthawk handing his mantle over to someone else.</p><p><a href=\"/fear-itself-the-deep/49-40418/\"><b>Fear Itself: The Deep</b></a></p><p>Namor and the Atlanteans are defeated by <a href=\"../../attuma/29-15779/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nerkkod</a>, who turns the remains of New Atlantis over to his generals, Tiger Shark, Tyrrak, and Aradnea. Namor and <a href=\"/loa/29-40672/\">Loa</a> regroup on the mainland and seek the aid of Dr. Strange, who casts a spell to summon the Defenders. Busy with other threats, the only one to respond is <a href=\"/savage-she-hulk/29-27405/\">Lyra</a>, genetic daughter to the Hulk. The four are attacked by demon sea creatures. The Silver Surfer comes to them, claiming to have seen seven objects falling from the sky, and offering his aid, thus filling the new team roster.</p><p><b>Defenders (2011)</b></p><p>Matt Fraction and Terry Dodson's Defenders team consists of original members Dr. Strange, Namor, Silver Surfer, and new members Red She Hulk and Iron Fist. It appears there will be other members rotating in and out, as Nick Fury and Ant-Man are featured in the first arc.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p><b>Avengers Defenders War</b></p><p>Loki and Dormamu trick the Defenders into fighting the Avengers and recovering the Evil Eye.</p><p><b>Day of the Defenders</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"843791\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35698/843791-defendersforaday1a_super.jpg\" title=\"Dollar Bill`s Defenders for a Day\"><img id=\"843791\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35698/843791-defendersforaday1a_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dollar Bill`s Defenders for a Day\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dollar Bill`s Defenders for a Day</div></div></div></div><p>Aspiring filmmaker, <a href=\"../../dollar-bill/29-34481/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dollar Bill</a> caused the majority of the confusion about the non-team called the Defenders. Unbeknownst to Nighthawk and the other Defenders, Bill made a documentary of the Defenders adventures and released it to public television. In it he declared that the Defenders were a non-team with no charter and no rules, in fact, anyone with powers who declared themselves a Defenders was automatically a member. He also revealed the location of the Defender's headquarters are the Richmond Riding Academy. Nighthawk was furious but Valkyrie assured him every thing would just blow over.</p><p>The next morning the yard was filled with new Defenders.

Professor <a href=\"/pieter-phobos/29-33395/\">Piotr Phobos</a> was the founder and instigator of the government program to train superhuman beings and mutants to serve the Soviet Union. Phobos established the school in Moscow and had a task force of KGB agents to search for appropriate students. The first student was Mikhail Ursus who had the ability to transform into a bear. The next two known students were the siblings <a href=\"/darkstar/29-10990/\">Laynia Petrovna</a> and <a href=\"/vanguard/29-13804/\">Nicolai Krylenko</a> who were the offspring of nuclear scientist Sergei Krylov who would later be known as the Presence. Unknown to the students and the government, Phobos was using a sophiscated machine to siphon the energies of his pupils to give himself artificial powers. The siphoning process was killing many students and Phobos would explained any deaths of his pupils as training casualties. The second <a href=\"/starlight/29-19931/\">Red Guardian</a> discovered Phobos's plan and Phobos was forced to leave the school and he fled to the Forbidden Zone. Before leaving he gave two totems to his star pupils, Krylenko and Petrovna to one day take control of them. Krylenko and Ursus would join the Soviet army for a brief time but would be reunited with Petrovna to form the Soviet Super Soldiers. Krylenko took the code name Vanguard, Petrovna called herself Darkstar and Ursus was called Ursa Major.</p><p>Their first assignment was to enter the Forbidden Zone and investigate the <a href=\"/presence/29-11340/\">Presence</a>, who the KGB believed was responsible for expanding radioactive devastation. Dimitri Bukharm as the <a href=\"/crimson-dynamo/29-7234/\">Crimson Dynamo</a> would join the Soviet Super Soldiers on this assignment. They came into conflict with the Presence, Red Guardian and the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>. The Super Soldiers were reunited with their former mentor Phobos who was actually the man who was behind the radioactive contamination. Phobos wanted to contaminate the Soviet Union with heavy radiation to foster the birth of more mutants so he can siphon their energies. The Soviet Super Soldiers and the Hulk thwarted his plans and Phobos was taken to the government to stand trial. The original members vowed not to serve the state after this assignment and the Crimson Dynamo would be expelled for still being loyal to the KGB.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Soviet Super Soldiers were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bill-mantlo/26-42478/\">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sal-buscema/26-12717/\">Sal Buscema</a> in 1981 and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-incredible-hulk/49-2406/\">The Incredible Hulk</a> # 258.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><p>The Soviet Super Soldiers would be asked by the state to investigate the dissident scientist called the <a href=\"/gremlin/29-13850/\">Gremlin</a>. The group reluctantly agreed and would come into conflict with the <a href=\"/dire-wraiths/65-14015/\">Dire Wraiths</a>. These aliens established a scientific citadel from which to infiltrate Russia. The Super Soldiers would join forces with the Gremlin, the spaceknights <a href=\"/rom/29-2189/\">Rom</a> and <a href=\"/starshine/29-13851/\">Starshine</a> to battle the Dire Wraiths.

While Ghost Rider as well as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/johnny-blaze/29-6108/\">Johnny Blaze</a> are trying to find a way to save Daniel Ketch who was killed by Blackout. Minutes later Ghost Rider communicates with Danny Ketch's spirit in the void and ther Danny encounters a vision of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilith/29-13796/\">Lilith</a> and her children raging war with Ghost rider and a group of supernatural characters being the only ones to stop her. Ghost Rider tells Blaze about the situation and agrees to join. After winning an attack by the Lilin at Blaze's carnival, Ghost Rider and Blaze go out to seek the other members of the Mystic Nine.</p><p>They first go to Manhattan to find <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morbius/29-6722/\">Morbius</a>. Morbius had hard times to come to his senses because of his blood lust and is almost killed by both the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilin/65-26662/\">Lilin</a> Fang and Doctor Langford during this event. Later on Ghost Rider went out to find the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkhold-redeemers/65-41436/\">Darkhold Redeemers</a> Victoria Montesti, her body guard Interpol agent Sam Buchanon, and occult expert Professor Louise Hastings.. Lilith, the Lilin the Darkholders, and even a spell caused by the Darkhold almost killed Victoria Montesi, but with the help of Ghost Rider and Blaze, they survived. They would then go to find the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightstalkers/65-40523/\">Nightstalkers</a> which consisted of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blade/29-7570/\">Blade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frank-drake/29-4399/\">Frank Drake</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hannibal-king/29-12710/\">Hannibal King</a> who just defeated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dracula/29-7206/\">Dracula</a>. The Nightstalkers were tricked by Lilith to kill Ghost Rider and Blaze, but the plan failed when Blade noticed the Lilin Meatmarket spying on them. The entire Midnight Sons would then be teleported by Doctor Strange to Greenland where Lilith was planing to release a whole army of demons. The Midnight Sons were victorious, but Ghost Rider died in battle (but was later brought back by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>). However while all the Lilin but Nakota are dead, Lilith has survived after all the Midnight Sons left the battle. She devours her remaining child and vows to come back for revenge.</p><h2>Midnight Massacre</h2><p>Blade wanted to rid the world of vampires and read a page of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkhold/18-45058/\">Darkhold</a> that made him possessed by the Demogorge turning him into Switchblade. Switchblade would go on a killing spree of all things supernatural. During this time, many of the Midnight Sons were murdered. The death list included the members Hannibal King who was the first to get killed, Johnny Blaze, Victoria Montesi, Morbius, and Ghost Rider but his Penance Stare weakened him. Demogoblin, Modred, and Werewolf by Night were also victims of Switchblade. With the help of Louise Hastings, Switchblade was defeated and Blade was back to normal. Everyone that Blade killed came back to life.</p><h2>Spider-X</h2><p>At one point the Midnight Sons would get together to stop a demon version of Spider-Man called Spider-X. Spider-Man who was going though a stressful time was offered by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-dwarf/29-14713/\">Darkhold Dwarf</a> a page from the Darkhold which <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> refused. The Dwarf later went to a fan of Spider-Man and gave him the Darkhold spell turning him into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-x/29-46174/\">Spider-X</a>. Ghost Rider and Johnny Blaze would get trapped in Spider-X's web after accidently riding their bikes into it. They would escape and at first think it was the real Spider-Man. They would then go after the creature. This would later lead to the Nightstalkers who were hired the Spider-Man fan's mother to look for him. They would end up getting attacked by Spider-X as well as attacking the Darkhold Redeemers Victoria Montesi and Jinx on the streets of New York. They would be saved by Ghost Rider and Blaze. Meanwhile Morbius was looking for Spider-X but bumps into the real Spider-Man. Soon all members of Midnight Sons and Spider-Man come in conflict with Spider-X. As they fight him, the mutant Paralyzer gives rebirth to an electric monster which set out to destroy the city. The Midnight Sons end up tricking Spider-X to defeat the monster but is killed by being shocked to death. Later the Midnight Sons end up destroying the Monster and help capture Paralyzer.</p><h2>Road to Vengeance</h2><p>Nine months later, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilith/29-13796/\">Lilith</a> and the reborn <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilin/65-26662/\">Lilin</a> returned with the aid of the soulless <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/centurious/29-14757/\">Centerious</a>. Both were looking for the Medallion of power. During this event, Daniel Ketch's mom was kidnapped, Ghost Rider fought <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathwatch/29-14782/\">Deathwatch</a> again, Blaze would be injured by Skinner and the Lilin but would come back as a powerful force, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vengeance/29-14759/\">Vengeance</a> would team up with Ghost Rider and Blaze with the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caretaker/29-14760/\">Caretaker</a>, and it was the return of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zarathos/29-13994/\">Zarathos</a>. Ghost Rider also learned that Blaze was his brother.</p><h2>Siege of Darkness</h2><p>The Midnight Sons with the help of Caretaker and Doctor Strange would fight against Lilith and a dark demonic mist. But this time Zarathos was with her. During the siege, the Midnight Sons would split into two teams. However the team lead by Morbius who was possessed by the Lilin Bloodthirst lead that team to a secret location and killed Darkhold Redeemer member Louise Hastings as well as lead the Lilin to capture Blade, Frank Drake, Jinx, and Modred. Meanwhile the team lead by Ghost Rider would end up saving Stacy Dolan and others from a Lilin attack in the police station.</p><p>At this point Ghost Rider's former enemy Vengeance join forces with the Midnight Sons. Later on Ghost Rider's team would be attacked by Morbius and the Lilin at Doctor Strange's Mansion. During this fight Dr. Strange would free Morbius from the control of Bloodthirst, but due to an overpowered force going on in his mind, he accidently destroys his mansion. The Midnight Sons later flee to the mystical Nightclub where they reform a plan to defeat Lilith. Ghost Rider, Johnny Blaze, and Vengeance, being spirits of Vengeance use the Medallion of Power to defeat Lilith and send her and her army by to the Shadowside Dimension but Zarathos would end up returning to power with the aid of his cult the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-fallen/29-45682/\">Fallen</a>.</p><p>Caretaker would be captured by Zarathos in which Blade and Frank Drake would try and save him only to end up in a fight with a strange race known as the people of the dust. During this change of events, Caretaker tells the Midnight Sons to find members of his old group the Blood to defeat Zarathos. He is later saved by Ghost Rider. At this most members of the Fallen have turned to Zarathos which includes Patriarch, and the death of other Blood Truth Seer at the hands of Modred and during this event Victoria Montesi found out she was carrying the author of the Darkhold <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chthon/29-15683/\">Chthon</a> as her unborn child.</p><p>However Hannibal King and Morbius would convert Fallen member Embyrre back to the Blood with her father Blood member Radar. Doctor Strange after a failed fight Fallen member Salome has became the powerful being Strange, and Ghost Rider would end up being killed by Zarathos.</p><p>In the final battle, the Midnight Sons get help from Blood member Foundry and gives Blade a sword known as the Juciscar which will killed the Fallen and Zarathos. After summerous battles against the Fallen, the defeat them which weakens Zarathos and Blade stabs Zarathos in the heart turning Zarathos into a statue defeating him. After the battle the member's of the Midnight Sons would get the mystical mark by Caretaker as a sign that they are Earths last hope against a supernatural threat. Except for Frank Drake who was to human to get the mark.</p><h2>Marvel Zombies: Return of The Midnight Sons</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"679440\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/679440-new_midnight_ii_super.jpg\" title=\"Enter: The New Midnight Sons\"><img id=\"679440\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/679440-new_midnight_ii_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Enter: The New Midnight Sons\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Enter: The New Midnight Sons</div></div></div></div><p>In the wake of the Earth-616 Zombie Infestation at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/armor/65-53864/\">A.R.M.O.R</a>., Morbius the Living Vampire learns that the zombie Simon Garth and the head of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zombie-deadpool/29-33654/\">Zombie Deadpool</a> have escaped A.R.M.O.R. With the director of ARMOR's blessing Morbius vows the stop the zombies and forms a new Midnight Sons team that consists of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jennifer-kale/29-8139/\">Jennifer Kale</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellstorm/29-14695/\">Daimon Hellstorm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-thing/29-4988/\">Man-Thing</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/werewolf-by-night/29-4984/\">Werewolf by Night.</a></p><p>Prior to starting their mission, each teammate makes a private video to a particular person that the MIdnight Sons know if they do not survive the zombie attack.</p><p>They begin their mission on a ship infested Fish-men who were bitten by Simon Garth and Deadpool. They teleport onto the ship and attack the Fish-men. Minutes before the ship can hit land, Hellstorm destroys the ship killing all the men fish.</p><p>They then end up on land and are attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">the Hood</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/night-shift/65-42096/\">NIght Shift</a>. Though they experience difficulty fighting the Night Shift at first, they end up turning the tables around and defeat them. However things would turn for the worse. The vaccine Morbius created to prevent the zombie infection turned in to an air born virus in the form of an undead storm cloud which would infect the small island town killing them and turning into zombies.</p><p>The Midnight Sons, along with the Hood, would try and keep safe in a big plantation house, except for Man-Thing who was safe from the storm cloud. Man-Thing would apparently be killed by a super human zombie and the storm cloud, but he later regenerates. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a> answers Jennifer Kale's call for help and also manages to take control of her. Jennifer is then forced to attack her teammates.</p><p>Hellstorm would get Dormammu out her body and Man-Thing survives the attack. After Morbius and Jennifer Kale save a zombie infected Jack Russell, the team transfers the zombie virus, with the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-talon/29-18590/\">Black Talon</a>, into Simon Garth who the Midnight Sons later lock up in the Hallow. From there they vow to continue their fight against the evil monsters of the world.</p>",

        "description":"<p>The TMNT as they are commonly known was once nothing more then a Black and White Comic Strip but soon their fame sky rocketed with Saturday morning cartoons, Comic books, and even a series of movies.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>The story of the <a href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/65-26934/\">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> starts in Japan in the year 1964 with the pet rat of <a href=\"/hamato-yoshi/29-55904/\">Hamato Yoshi</a>. The rat would often watch his owner as he practiced Ninjitsu and would try and mimic him. Yoshi was the best warrior of the Foot Clan, his only rival was a man named <a href=\"/oroku-nagi/29-55906/\">Oroku Nagi</a> with whom he competed in all things but none more fiercely than for the love of the lady <a href=\"/tang-shen/29-55907/\">Tang Shen</a>. Both tried to woo her but from the beginning she loved only Yoshi. One day Yoshi walked into Shen's home to find her being beaten by Nagi who demanded that she love him, enraged by this Yoshi fought and killed Nagi.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2373087\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67336/2373087-hamato_yoshi_034.jpg\" title=\"Hamato and Splinter\"><img id=\"2373087\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67336/2373087-hamato_yoshi_034_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hamato and Splinter\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hamato and Splinter</div></div></div></div><p>Yoshi's shame was great, by killing a member of his own clan he had only two options ; to end his own life and hope for honor in the next or flee to another country. Yoshi chose the latter and took Shen and his pet rat along with him to immigrate to New York.</p><p>Back in Japan Nagi's younger brother Oroku Saki vowed vengeance against those responsible for the death of his brother. He enrolled in the Foot Clan and over the years became their deadliest warrior. The Foot decided to expand it's influence to the rest of the world and chose Saki to lead it's American branch. Using this opportunity for revenge Saki set up the Foot in New York and took on the persona of \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shredder/29-42406/\">Shredder</a>\". He tracked down Yoshi and Shen and killed both of them in cold blood.</p><p>Leaving only Yoshi's pet rat he scavenged the streets for food until one day he saw a road accident involving a truck carrying toxic waste. Out of the truck a canister came flying out which struck a bowl of four baby turtles which was being carried by a young boy. The canister and the four turtles fell into an open manhole. The rat followed them down onto the sewers and saw the four turtles covered on the <a href=\"/mutagen/18-55117/\">ooze</a> which was spilling out of the now broken</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1168021\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/1168021-turtlesevolve_super.jpg\" title=\"Turtles evolve\"><img id=\"1168021\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/1168021-turtlesevolve_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Turtles evolve\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Turtles evolve</div></div></div></div><p>canister. Not knowing exactly why he gathered them up getting ooze on himself. He awoke the next morning to the shock that they had doubled in both size and intellect. The four turtles followed the rat everywhere except above ground. They all began walking upright but the rat received a shock when one day one of the turtles actually spoke the word \"Splinter\" and in doing so named the rat, soon they all began to speak.</p><p>Knowing that the outside world not understand them Splinter began training them in the art of Ninjitsu that he had learned from his Master Yoshi. With an old renaissance art book that he found in a storm drain he gave them all names ; <a href=\"/leonardo/29-44712/\">Leonardo</a>, <a href=\"/michaelangelo/29-44711/\">Michelangelo</a>, <a href=\"/donatello/29-44709/\">Donatello</a>, and <a href=\"/raphael/29-37764/\">Raphael</a>.</p><h2>Facing the Shredder</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1168054\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/1168054-tmnt_group_super.jpg\" title=\"Coming of age\"><img id=\"1168054\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/1168054-tmnt_group_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Coming of age\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Coming of age</div></div></div></div><p>When the turtles were thirteen years of age, after facing off against a street gang known as the <a href=\"/purple-dragons/65-57781/\">Purple Dragons</a> Splinter decides that their training is now complete and told them the full story of their origin. He had grown old now and thought that he had not long to live and so charged the turtles to avenge the death of his Master by killing The Shredder.</p><p>Raphael was chosen to deliver the message to Shredder. He infiltrated the Foot Clan's Head Quarters dispatching many of the ninja guards. After spying on Oroku Saki inside a separate building, he threw one of his sais through the window. Attached was a note which challenged Shredder to a dual to the death to restore the honor of Hamato Yoshi.</p><p>The turtles arrived on the roof top location specified on the note and waited for their foe. From afar Saki now in his Shredder guise watched and wondered who the four mysterious creatures were and how his murder of Yoshi could still come back to haunt him. Facing the turtles they suddenly were surrounded by Foot Ninja with which they did battle. The turtles managed to defeat the Foot with some injuries. It was then that the Shredder chose to face the turtles. The four turtles initially tried to battle the Shredder individually but the armored warrior was too strong. They decided to face him all together, not faring much better until Leonardo managed to plunge his</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"521444\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/521444-pg27_super.jpg\" title=\"The Shredder\"><img id=\"521444\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/521444-pg27_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Shredder\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Shredder</div></div></div></div><p>Katana through the Shredder's torso. As the Shredder lay bleeding he told the turtles to \"finish it\" but Leonardo refused, offering him his Katana saying that would regain his honor if he ended his own life. Saki refused and took out a Thermite Bomb which would wipe the rooftop clean of all life. Donatello quickly used his Bo Staff to knock Shredder and the bomb off the roof. As he fell the bomb exploded killing The Shredder. With their mission complete the four turtles returned home.</p><h2>Further Adventures</h2><p>Not long after the defeat of the Shredder, Master Splinter became troubled at a news report of the scientist Baxter Stockman and the invention he hoped would put an end of New York's rat problem, the Mousers. Splinter's ill feeling proved to be well deserved as in the sewers the turtles rescued a young woman who was being attacked by the Mousers.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2373074\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67336/2373074-april_turtles.jpg\" title=\"TMNT meet April\"><img id=\"2373074\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67336/2373074-april_turtles_medium.jpg\" alt=\"TMNT meet April\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">TMNT meet April</div></div></div></div><p>Taking the woman back to their lair, she introduced herself as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/april-oneil/29-44968/\">April O'Neil</a> and explained that she was Stockman's Lab Assistant until she discovered that the Mousers true purpose was to steal money from banks as well as extort money from the City. Disgusted by this she ran from him ending up in the sewers but Stockman turned the Mousers on her. The four turtles decided to return with her to Stockman's lab intent on stopping his schemes. While being attacked by the Mousers, Donatello and April managed to them down.</p><p>The turtles escorted April out of the Sewers were she gave them her phone number telling them to call if they ever needed her help. The turtles returned home to find it in ruins and Master Splinter was no where to be found. Knowing that soon the Police and repair crews would be there to investigate and fix the damage done by the Mousers the turtles returned to the surface and used a phone box to call April who arranged to meet them.</p><p>April met them in her van and told them they could stay with her for the time being. They soon ran into trouble as April's van matched the description of another van involved in an armed robbery twenty minutes prior. Knowing that they couldn't be stopped by the police for fear of being discovered by the authorities they led the police car on a chase around the city until finally leading them to the real robbers.</p><p>After moving in with April, Raphael found it particularly hard without their master. A sparring session with Michelangelo gets out of hand Raphael grabs a monkey wrench and lunges at brother. The rest of his brothers managed to stop the angry turtle. Raphael ran out of the building disgusted by the thought that he could have killed his best friend and lamenting that he can't keep his anger under control.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"432186\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/432186-bz19_super.JPG\" title=\"Raphael vs Casey Jones\"><img id=\"432186\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/432186-bz19_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Raphael vs Casey Jones\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Raphael vs Casey Jones</div></div></div></div><p>While out, Raphael overhears a mugging in an alleyway but when he gets there he witnesses an individual wearing a Hockey mask stopping it. The turtle soon realizes that the man who identified himself as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/casey-jones/29-44890/\">Casey Jones</a> wasn't letting up on the muggers and could easily kill them. Raphael stops the fight but is in turn attacked by Casey himself. Knocking the turtle to the floor, Casey makes his escape. Raphael realizes that he can't simply let the vigilante go and follows him to the Park where they begin to fight again. This time Raphael beats Casey. After being lectured by the turtle on his violent methods Casey points out that he doesn't think that Raphael is so different, to which Raphael responds that he at least tries to control his temper. At that moment, they hear someone being mugged calling for help and the two decide to stop the crime together.</p><h2>Turtles in Space</h2><p>While searching for their missing Master the turtles come across a building with the logo T.C.R.I., the same acronym that was printed on the canister of ooze that mutated them. Wanting to investigate the full truth of their origins the turtles infiltrate the building but they are baffled when every floor they search looks the same. They find a key card and use it to gain access to a locked room but are shocked to find a tube filled with liquid and their Master Splinter floating in the center.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2070464\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67336/2070464-utroms.jpg\" title=\"Splinter &amp; The Utroms\"><img id=\"2070464\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67336/2070464-utroms_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Splinter &amp; The Utroms\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Splinter & The Utroms</div></div></div></div><p>Shocked and angered three turtles go to break the tube they think is displaying the corpse of their Master but Donatello stops them explaining that Splinter is alive in Suspended animation and the machinery around them was supporting his vital functions. Suddenly, the turtles are interrupted by several brain-like creatures operating humanoid exo skeletons. The turtles retreat into another room with a giant machine that the creatures don't want to risk harming. Unfortunately the control panel of the machine is damaged, the turtles are dematerialized and teleported away.The turtles materialize on the planet D'hoonib in the middle of a battle. They come to they aid of Professor Honycutt, a brilliant scientist whose mind is trapped in the body of an android, who is being hunted down by Federation soldiers who want him to build a transmat device which they hope to use to further their militaristic ambitions. Realizing that this \"Fugitoid\" may well be their key to returning home they decide to stay with him. The turtles and their new friend go to an alien cantina to try and arrange passage off the the planet but the bar is soon raided by soldiers of an alien race known as the Triceratons who kidnap Honycutt. Stealing an aircar the turtles follow the Triceratons to what they they think is their base but are shocked to learn is a spaceship which is on it's way to the Triceraton Homeworlds.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"435787\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/435787-triceratons_super.jpg\" title=\"TMNT vs The Triceratons\"><img id=\"435787\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/435787-triceratons_medium.jpg\" alt=\"TMNT vs The Triceratons\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">TMNT vs The Triceratons</div></div></div></div><p>The Triceratons discover the stowaway turtles in a trance to conserve oxygen. The soldiers equip the turtles with breathing devices so the can survive in the Triceratons' atmosphere and quicly imprison them, hoping to use them as a bargaining chip to coerce Honycutt into building a Transmat for them. Realizing that the Triceratons and their Prime Leader Zanramon are just as evil as the Federation he swears never to build a Transmat even if it means the death of his friends. Honycutt is forced to watch the turtles are placed in the Tri-Sports arena as they fight the Triceraton All Star Team. The turtles defeat their opponents and jump up into the stands picking up their android pal as well as taking Zanramon hostage. The turtles and Honycutt try to escape the arena but Zanramon is killed in a firefight, just when things start to look grim the turtles, Honycutt and several Triceratons are bathed in a white light and are teleported away.</p><p>The group find themselves back at the TCRI building on Earth. After a short firefight the Triceratons are teleported back to their homeworld leaving the turtles and the mysterious TCRI aliens. A tense moment is broken by the arrival of Master Splinter who explains that while the turtles were confronting Stockman the lair was attacked by Mousers. Retreating into the sewer tunnels he was injured and lapsed into unconsciousness when he was found by a TCRI workman who brought him to the building to heal him. The aliens who identified themselves as the Utroms explained that twenty years prior their space ship crash landed on Earth. The craft being beyond repair they decided to blend in with humans by constructing exosuits, seeking employment and slowly gaining enough money buy a building turn into the Techno Cosmic Research Institute were they built a transmat so they could return home. A byproduct of their experiments with the transmats is the Ooze, thirteen years ago a road accident while on their way to a disposal site led to them losing a canister down the sewers which led to the turtles and Splinter becoming mutated. At that moment the Utroms explain that the energy flash of transmat has put the TCRI building under human scrutiny and at that moment the National Guard are trying force their way in. The Utroms activate a self destruct and program the Transmat to take that back to their homeworld, offering Honycutt a place with them which he instantly accepts the group teleport out with the building imploding soon after. The turtles themselves are later teleported back to Earth into April O'Neil's bathroom.</p><h2>What Goes Around...Comes Around</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"444250\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/444250-leonardo1_super.gif\" title=\"He's Back...\"><img id=\"444250\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/444250-leonardo1_medium.gif\" alt=\"He's Back...\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">He's Back...</div></div></div></div><p>On Christmas Eve Leonardo goes out for a training run on the rooftops of the city when he is attacked by a literal army of Foot Soldiers. The fight goes on for hours with the turtle holding his ground until he's shocked by the sight of familiar foe. Back in April's apartment the turtles become worried that their brother had been gone so long and are about to go look for him when Leonardo comes crashing through the window. Severely beaten and barely conscious he tells them \"he's back ... the ... Shredder.\"</p><p>The Foot Clan come bursting into April O'Neil's apartment. An intense battle breaks out which follows the turtles, April and Splinter trying to escape the building via the antique store bellow. As the enter the group switch on the lights of the store they are met by Foot Soldiers and the Shredder. A tense moment is interrupted by the arrival of Raphael's friend Casey Jones who has come to aid the turtles. A fire breaks out which attracts the police. Hearing the sirens the Shredder orders the Foot to scatter but vows that the \"war is far from over\". Realizing they need a place to go April is next seen riding in Casey's car, a U-Haul trailer attached with an injured Leonardo, the rest of the turtles and Splinter inside as it heads to Northampton.</p><h2>Exile in Northampton</h2><p>In Northampton the group stays in a dilapidated farm house which used to belong to Casey's grandmother. April finds life on the farm difficult, depressed and suffering from nightmares she keeps a journal which she writes down her observations on how each of her new family are coping with their first defeat.</p><p>Leonardo has healed physically but his confidence in himself has shattered. Everyday he goes into the woods hunt the local wildlife. We follow him as he has a skirmish with a large buck. The turtle is knocked down by the deer and he sits dejectedly in the snow, looking utterly defeated.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"444396\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/444396-donfix_super.png\" title=\"Donatello fixes up the farmhouse\"><img id=\"444396\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6726/444396-donfix_medium.png\" alt=\"Donatello fixes up the farmhouse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Donatello fixes up the farmhouse</div></div></div></div><p>Donatello is obsessively working on the many repairs to the farmhouse. He fixes up a windmill and water wheel to provide electricity and hooks up a wooden stove for heat. His biggest project however is getting the hot water heater working. A brief moment of happiness ensues foe the whole group when he finally manages to get it working. April is surprised when she observes him with a typewriter and wonders what he could be writing about.</p><p>Michelangelo worries April the most. Where once he would laugh and joke about anything he hardly laughs anymore with the exception of some half-hearted goofing with Casey and Raph. He spends the majority of time alone in the barn taking out his frustration on a punching bag. We see him lashing out at aggressively punching through the wall of the barn.</p><p>Raphael's behavior scares April. Observing that his behavior is unbalanced and unpredictable. He is the first person to get up in the morning and the last to go to sleep. During the day he spends most of his time with Casey fixing up an old truck while playfully insulting each other. He spends most of the night alone on the roof of the barn keeping watch.</p><p>One day while walking on the lake the ice cracks and April falls into freezing water below. Leonardo is returning to farm after hunting in the woods and sees April's fall. Leo uses his katana and cloak to make a lifeline and pulls April out of the cold depths, and then carries her home. While the turtles and Casey are watching over the recovering April Splinter tells them that their spirits have drifted for too long and puts the team back to work, training together again</p><p>.</p><p>A month after her fall into the ice April writes a more hopeful journal entry stating that \"Life is good ... and life goes on.\" As the turtles and Splinter sit by a campfire the rat congratulates his sons on their progress and tries to relieve their concerns about April stating that she gained more by friendship than she has lost and thinks that April realizes that. The next day the turtles wake up a very happy April with breakfast in bed.</p><h2>Archie Adventure Series History</h2><p>Based closely on the animated series at first, the Archie version of TMNT developed a very distinct history of it's own over time.</p><h3>The beginning of our heroes tale</h3><p>As an alien ship crashes to central park, the TMNT meet an alien who is holding an object of great power which he calls \"The Eye of Sarnath\" the four turtles take possession of the object as the alien passes away. But this starship crash has also attracted the attention of The Shredder and his alien ally Krang, and the pair along with their Foot Soldier robots, Baxter Stockman, and a pair of mutated thugs known as Bebop and Rocksteady seek to take down the TMNT and claim the Eye of Sarnath as their own. Shredder eventually claims the Eye and uses it to shrink the turtles But Splinter and April manage to free the TMNT and restore them to normal size, in the ensuing battle the Eye of Sarnath is lost forever into the sewers.</p><h3>Now that the animated series re-cap is out of the way...</h3><p>Shredder is desperately seeking to regain the Eye of Sarnath, using a submarine to search areas where the sewer runs off into the Atlantic ocean and Hudson river. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutagen/18-55117/\">Mutagen</a> which has made it's way into the sewers has led to a scientist who has noticed mutations and deformities to investigate the area as well, and when caught in a bath of run-off mutagen, the man is transformed into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ray-fillet/29-50065/\">Man-Ray</a>, and an underwater battle ensues between he and Shredder, Man-Ray wins the fight, dragging Shredder onto the land and to the TMNT, but the turtles don't know what to make of their new ally, who seems on the verge of passing out, and after Man-Ray returns to the sea, the TMNT realise Shredder has escaped.</p><p>Shredder feels Bebop and Rocksteady are inept, and consider devolving the mutants with another Mutagen dose, but soon stumbles upon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/leatherhead/29-48851/\">Jess Harley</a>, a man who has been transformed by the Turnstone by Mary Bones into the alligator man known now as Leatherhead, Shredder takes the opportunity of Leatherhead's recent traumatic transformation to trick the Gator-Man into believing the TMNT work for Mary Bones and knew how to cure him. Leatherhead, Bebop, and Rocksteady attack the TMNT, and are winning, but Shredder's fears of Bebop and Rocksteady's lack of even common sense is proven when the pair let it slip that they are in fact the bad guys. Feeling used Leatherhead throws a tantrum and the bridge they had been fighting on collapses beneath him, the TMNT are helpless to save Leatherhead, or capture Bebop and Rocksteady who are on the opposite side of the collapsed bridge. But the turtles themselves are then met with a strange sight, a giant Cow's head named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cudley-the-cowlick/29-53261/\">Cudley The Cowlick</a>, who sucks them into his mouth and transports the four to Dimension X to compete in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/intergalactic-wrestling-federation/65-53174/\">Intergalactic Wrestling Federation</a> on Stamp Asteroid. Upon their arrival the team is relieved to see Cudley had also saved Leatherhead, but less so that the 5 reptiles of Earth were being forced to wear new costumes and fight for the entertainment of Dimension X's masses. While the TMNT fought <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cryin-hound/29-52918/\">Cryin' Houn</a>', Leatherhead battled <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ace-duck/29-53172/\">Ace Duck</a>. In the end both the TMNT and Leatherhead won, but Stump refused to return them to Earth, at least until Cudley coughed up the turtle's weapons at which point Stump and Sling were more then happy to have Cudley take them home, except Leatherhead, who chose to stay stating that \"on Earth I'm a freak, but here I'm a hero\" The TMNT respected their new friends decision and left without him.</p><p>Returning to Earth the TMNT were shocked to see New York City half underwater, and asked Cudley what had happened, Cudley apologized stating that he had accidentally brought them to an alternate future (look for this future much later in the series) and once again laps them up into his mouth and drops them into the appropriate timeline.</p><p>Upon being dropped off Raphael is hit in the head by a rock, and hears the laughter of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wingnut/29-51349/\">Wingnut</a>, an alien bat from Dimension X and his partner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/screwloose/29-51426/\">Screwloose</a>, the Turtles engage in a brief battle with Wingnut &amp; Screwloose, and come out victorious, but discover that the pair are actually enemies of Krang and potential allies, but before the TMNT can offer them a home in the lair, Cudley abducts the pair taking them to Stump Asteroid like the Turtles and Leatherhead had been before.</p><p>The Turtles then have a few battles that don't greatly impact the main story of this series against the Foot Clan, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scumbug/29-51539/\">Scumbug</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wyrm/29-53149/\">Wyrm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chameleon/29-53099/\">Codename Chameleon</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-rat-king/29-50113/\">The Rat King</a>, but are soon once again abducted by aliens, this time not by the well meaning Cudley, but by the Foot Clan's new allies <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sons-of-silence/65-57400/\">The Sons of Silence</a>, but luckily the Swamp Witch Mary Bones intervenes (the one who turned Jess into Leatherhead) and saves the TMNT, revealing herself to not be an old hag, but an incredibly beautiful shape-shifting alien who reveals her true name as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cherubae/29-53024/\">Cherubae</a> and that the Foot and the Sons of Silence must not gain possession of the Turnstone, To this end she reunites the turtles with Leatherhead, Wingnut, and Screwloose, who are also joined by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trap/29-52933/\">Trap</a>, an IWF wrestler who only made a brief appearance during the TMNT's last visit to Stump Asteroid. Now that the TMNT and Cherubae had their allies in place it seemed Krang had the same idea, turning to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maligna/29-51500/\">Maligna</a>, a fellow warlord who Krang knew to have a powerful army at her disposal. With Maligna's horde of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/malignoid/29-52912/\">Malignoids</a> joining the Foot Clan and Sons of Silence, the TMNT, Cherubae, IWF wrestlers fought in a televised conflict dubbed, what else, The Final Conflict. <b><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15317/1208211-1304_super.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15317/1208211-1304_thumb.jpg\" /></a></b></p><p>At the close of this battle the TMNT and their allies proved victorious, Krang was transported to a Dimension X prison/toxic waste dump world, Rocksteady and Bebop to an extremely primitive, but peaceful planet, and Shredder was stripped of his battle armor and sent to a maximum security prison on Earth, but victory was bittersweet for Leatherhead, who Cherubae would not restore to his original human form.</p><h3>Return to Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"712105\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15317/712105-1401_super.jpg\" title=\"The TMNT's first encounter with Jagwar\"><img id=\"712105\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15317/712105-1401_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The TMNT's first encounter with Jagwar\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The TMNT's first encounter with Jagwar</div></div></div></div><p>The TMNT are dropped off in South America by Cudley, there they encounter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jagwar/29-51418/\">Jagwar</a>, a leopard like creature who was born to a human mother and the Jaguar Spirit, the Turtles and their new ally become fast friends, and soon break up an illegal slash and burn operation in the rain forests, finding April O'Neil, who had been reporting the illegal operation undercover but was found out by the criminals who were led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-terra/29-51419/\">Kid Terra</a> (representing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-null/29-51398/\">Mr. Null</a>) During their adventures with Jagwar, the team also meet <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dreadmon/29-51427/\">Dreadmon</a>, a once human super-fast wolf like creature.

The past turtles agree to help their future counterparts and travel to the future, where they discover the group had become quite wealthy due to Donatello's inventions and now live openly in the public.

The forfeit did not go as quietly as it should have, as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/domino/29-2161/\">Domino </a>happened to be in the cemetery, to bring flowers to a vault at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Logan</a>'s request. After a brief fight, Domino succeeded in wounding Chimera, but Spiral had secured Kwannon's corpse in the meantime and the three teammates left the scene, leaving Domino to call Logan and ask who Kwannon was. <br />&nbsp;<br />After healing Chimera, Red Queen revealed more of her scheme, as she announced she would be \"filling\" this body of \"a dead girl\" with \"a live one\" - Psylocke, whom she had mysteriously captured while she was with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exiles/65-19986/\">Exiles</a>. After some preparation on the corpse by Spiral, Red Queen and the Wyngarde sisters used their telepathy to transfer Psylocke's soul back into her original body, and Red Queen manipulated her into becoming the Sisterhood's last member. At this point, the other Sisterhood members asked for their part of the bargain - the return of their dead ones -&nbsp; but none of their attacks proved successful, as Red Queen turned out to be a sort of ghost. She however announced that the first transfer was only a test run for a second one that would enable her own spirit to inhabit the body of another powerful telepath: Jean Grey. <br />&nbsp;<br />To perform that ritual, the Sisterhood launched an attack on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>'s new headquarters in San Francisco, aided by the previously captured <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empath/29-2173/\">Empath</a>, efficiently taking out all the adults. While all her teammates were fighting, Red Queen sneaked off to Wolverine's room to recover a lock of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>'s hair which he had kept as a keepsake, and that she needed to locate Jean Grey's burial site.<br />&nbsp;<br />Back to their headquarters, Red Queen performed the ritual to find Jean Grey's grave, and left with Spiral, Deathstrike and Chimera, leaving Psylocke and the Wyngardes to hold off the X-Men. <br />&nbsp;<br />Unfortunately for her, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops </a>had correctly anticipated Red Queen's next move, and had Domino dig out Jean's coffin before the Sisterhood arrived. A fight broke out when Cyclops' squad arrived, but Red Queen eventually took a shot at possessing Jean Grey's body. However, this corpse turned out not to be Jean's, having been switched by Domino with another one nearby. Since only a powerful telepath's body could host the Red Queen's spirit, she seemingly vanished out of existence. <br />&nbsp;<br />Spiral the set out to teleport back to the Sisterhood's headquarters with Deathstrike and Chimera, but arrived in the middle of another fight opposing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>'s squad and the remaining members of the Sisterhood. During that battle, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler </a>blasted off Psylocke's face, which helped her fight off the Red Queen 's manipulation and consequently break free, returning to her Asian body again. <br />&nbsp;<br />Spiral then teleported the remaining Sisterhood members, and their status or whereabouts are yet to be defined.<br /><br />\n<h2>Membership</h2><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-queen/29-57106/\">Red Queen</a> (believed to be Madelyne Pryor, leader)<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chimera/29-7089/\">Chimera</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martinique-jason/29-15167/\">Mastermind</a> (Martinique Wyngarde)<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spiral/29-9722/\">Spiral</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-deathstrike/29-8470/\">Lady Deathstrike</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-mastermind/29-12055/\">Lady Mastermind</a> (Regan Wyngarde)&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> (Betsy Braddock)<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/revanche/29-9709/\">Revanche</a> (Kwannon)",

        "description":"<p>The history of the Vishanti may have started untold billions of years ago. <a href=\"/oshtur/29-27220/\">Oshtur</a>, the Goddess of the Dawn was born as one of the <a href=\"/elder-gods/65-52790/\">Elder Gods</a>, the first beings ever to have existed on Earth. Unlike most of her siblings, Oshtur had a fascination for what lies beyond the stars, and so she decided to leave Earth and travel across the universe which also allowed her to escape the dark fate of the rest of the Elder Gods.</p><p>During her travels, she met <a href=\"/hoggoth/29-27219/\">Hoggoth</a>, one of the <a href=\"/the-great-old-ones/65-48427/\">Old Ones</a>. Hoggoth was all alone and is accompanied by the ghost of his fellows, known as the Host of Hoggoth. He soon joined Oshtur on her travels across the univese.</p><p>Upon her arrival back to the place of her birth, Oshtur found out the horrific fate of her siblings and decided to perform self-exile so that her sister <a href=\"/gaea/29-15778/\">Gaea</a> remains safe and the spell of the <a href=\"/atum-the-god-eater/29-41842/\">Demogorge</a> intact. Also, somewhere during this time, Oshtur witness children playing and was touched by the scene where a blind child still managed to smile despite his handicap. A single tear fell from the Goddess's eye and from there, <a href=\"/agamotto/29-21584/\">Agamotto</a> was born.</p><p>Oshtur taught Agamotto about the secrets of the universe but she also told him to take his own path and discover the world of magic. Agamotto followed his mother, and from his travels he discovered the Three Paths of Magic. He also became the first <a href=\"/sorcerer-supreme/12-55956/\">Sorcerer Supreme</a>, and the first defender of the Earth dimension from mystic threats such as that of the dreaded Dormammu.</p><p>These three principalities soon combined their might which in turn led to the creation of the Vishanti. The Vishanti served as the prime protector of the Earth dimension as well as the entire universe from mystic threats. Millions of year before the rise of the first humans, the Vishanti fought the unspeakable evil of <a href=\"/shuma-gorath/29-14000/\">Shuma-Gorath</a>. Their battle ended to a stalemate as neither one cannot destroy the other.</p><p>The Goddess Oshtur, with the aid of the rest of the Vishanti commissioned the creation of the <a href=\"/book-of-the-vishanti/18-42074/\">Book of the Vishanti</a>, a powerful tome of benevolent magic set to oppose the Book of the <a href=\"/the-darkhold/18-45058/\">Darkhold</a>, created by the demonic Elder God <a href=\"/chthon/29-15683/\">Chthon</a>.</p><p>The Vishanti also created the seat of the Sorcerer Supreme to serve as the universe's protector against mystic threats. The Vishanti also gave <a href=\"/aged-genghis/29-47068/\">Aged Genghis</a> great power and in return for this power, Genghis agreed to summon together the greatest mystics in the world for a tournament to discover the Sorcerer Supreme known as the Trial of the Vishanti. The first mortal to ever held the title was the sorceress Ayesha of Balobedu, ancestor of <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Ororo Munroe</a>, known as the X-Men member Storm. The current holder of the title is Jericho Drumm, also known as Brother Vodoo, but perhaps the most well known Sorcerer Supreme was <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Stephen Strange</a>, known as the former master of the mystic arts Doctor Strange.</p><p>In recent times, the Vishanti participated in the War of the Seven Spheres and took <a href=\"/salome/29-46587/\">Salome</a> as their champion when Dr. Strange refused. But it didn't take long for Strange to reconsider and fought the war for millenia and yet when the war was over, he only aged one year. During this time, the Vishanti was summoned by the vessel of Gaea to battle Slorioth. The Vishanti knew that if they would Slorioth directly, the release of macro-cosmic energies from their fight might destroy the entire plane. So they summoned the <a href=\"/living-tribunal/29-6811/\">Living Tribunal</a> who then placed judgement to Slorioth and banished the entity.</p><p>According to Oshtur and Hoggoth, the first law of the Vishanti is that \"With great power there must also come great responsibility.\"</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>The Vishanti is said to be the supreme-most being of the mystic arts. Each of its members are vastly powerful in their own right.</p><p>Oshtur as an Elder Goddess possesses power beyond any other Gods of Earth in their prime. Her power is great enough to rival her brother Chthon, who's mere presence threatens the entire universe. Many sorcerers have claimed her \"Omnipotence\" and often seek the aid of her \"Mighty Hands\".. Her status as an Elder God and her title clealry makes her the most powerful member of the Vishanti.</p><p>Hoggoth as one of the Old Ones is a being of great mystical powers comparable to that of the Elder Gods</p><p>Agamotto as the son of the Elder Goddess Oshtur also possesses vast mystical power. He was able to stand against such threats <a href=\"/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a> and was stalemate the cosmic being <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>. He is also the creator of many powerful mystical items such as the Eye of Agamotto and the Orb of Agamotto. He also granted his power to beings such as the Sorcerer Supreme, the Minorus and <a href=\"/witchfire/29-26481/\">Witchfire</a>.</p><p>The full extent of the combined might of the Vishanti is still unknown, but is said to be greater than that of most cosmic beings such as Galactus as Agamotto alone is of sufficient power to fight the world devourer, also the Vishanti is capable of summoning the Living Tribunal is a realm not of their own while it took the combined effort of Galactus and the <a href=\"/watcher/29-7120/\">Watcher</a> just to summon <a href=\"/eternity/29-11332/\">Eternity</a> in their own native realm.</p><p>The power of the Vishanti can be used in nearly-infinite number of effects such as:</p><ul><li>Induce temporary paralysis</li><li>Manipulating matter on an atomic level</li><li>Conjure the illusion of reality</li><li>Banishing the winds of Watoomb</li><li>Conjure the Circle of Cyttorak</li><li>Enable the Shades of the Seraphim to banish the Vapors of Valtorr</li><li>Time Travel</li><li>Inter-dimensional Teleportation</li><li>Matter Transmutation</li></ul><p>The Vishanti never appeared to any mortal, even those trained in the occult, for their true aspect is something which no mortal mind could comprehend and remain sane. Instead, they chose to appear in a variety of disguised physical forms. The Vishanti are also All-knowing, at least when the three principalities combined as one.</p><p>The Vishanti are the greatest trinity of magical beings in the Multiverse even though they themselves individually are not apparently Multiversal in nature.</p>",

Eight of the world's greatest heroes all banded together to stop Adolf Hitler's invasion of Britain and to protect President Roosevelt from a group of Valkyries summoned by Hitler.</p><p>These heroes were <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-scott/29-12663/\">Green Lantern</a> (Alan Scott), the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Flash</a> (Jay Garrick), the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spectre/29-2361/\">Spectre</a> (Jim Corrigan), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-fate/29-5898/\">Doctor Fate</a> (Kent Nelson), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hourman/29-7643/\">Hourman</a> (Rex Tyler), the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sandman/29-9292/\">Sandman</a> (Wesley Dodds), the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/al-pratt/29-9298/\">Atom</a> (Al Pratt) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkman/29-8337/\">Hawkman</a>.</p><p>When US involvement in WW II seemed inevitable, President Roosevelt suggested that these costumed heroes band together as a team to defend US shores. The costumed heroes agreed to be this team to fight the Axis powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kal-l/29-62833/\">Superman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> were also honorary members of the JSA.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Justice Society of America made their first appearance in All-Star Comics #3 in 1940. They were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sheldon-mayer/26-16240/\">Sheldon Mayer</a> and comic book legend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gardner-fox/26-41171/\">Gardner Fox</a>. Mayer and Fox worked with other writers and artists for this debut.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age</h3><p>During WW II, the Justice Society acquired the wartime name, the Justice Battalion, as the first line of defense for the US. On the US home front, the JSA would continue to deal with crime and super-villains as well as Axis spies and saboteurs. The first headquarters for the JSA was a hotel suite in New York City. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US government created the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/all-star-squadron/65-41753/\">All-Star Squadron</a>, which banded together every costumed hero. The JSA became one of the most active parts of the All-Star Squadron.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1667100\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43390/1667100-perez_jla_jsa_super.jpg\" title=\"An older, but largely intact, pre-Crisis JSA.\"><img id=\"1667100\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43390/1667100-perez_jla_jsa_medium.jpg\" alt=\"An older, but largely intact, pre-Crisis JSA.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">An older, but largely intact, pre-Crisis JSA.</div></div></div></div><p>Other costumed heroes that joined the JSA were <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/johnny-thunder/29-4935/\">Johnny Thunder</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolt/29-33126/\">Thunderbolt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/charles-mcnider/29-9301/\">Doctor Mid-Nite</a> (Charles McNider), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terry-sloane/29-47343/\">Mr. Terrific</a> (Terry Sloane), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ted-knight/29-9296/\">Starman</a> (Ted Knight), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildcat/29-7645/\">Wildcat</a> (Ted Grant), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-canary/29-1689/\">Black Canary</a> (Dinah Drake) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkgirl/29-6903/\">Hawkgirl</a>. After the war, the team would move their headquarters into a brownstone building in Gotham City.</p><p>Superman and Batman were later retconned as not being born yet until the Modern Age and were never members of the JSA. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miss-america/29-31887/\">Miss America</a> was later retconned as being a member of the team. Queen <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hippolyta/29-4929/\">Hippolyta</a> was later retconned as being the Golden Age Wonder Woman.</p><h3>Silver Age &amp; Bronze Age</h3><p>After the JSA disbanded and retired in the early 1950s, they would come out of retirement to reform the team again in 1963 when contacted by another group of super-heroes from a parallel earth. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League of America</a> from Earth-1 needed the help of the JSA who came from Earth-2 to fight the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crime-champions/65-51406/\">Crime Champions</a>. The JSA and the JLA defeated their enemies and would continue to meet on an annual basis.</p><p>A few years later, after a JLA/JSA team-up, Black Canary would leave the JSA to join the JLA. After the return of the JSA, other heroes that joined the JSA were the adult <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-spangled-kid/29-10998/\">Star Spangled Kid</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-girl/29-4915/\">Power Girl</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helena-wayne/29-45563/\">Huntress</a> (Helena Wayne). Years later, the Star Spangled Kid, Power Girl and the Huntress joined a team called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinity-inc/65-40384/\">Infinity, Inc.</a> whose members were the offspring or wards of the JSA.</p><p>In a later retcon, it was established that the JSA's Golden Age Black Canary was the mother of the JLA's Silver Age Black Canary. The adult Robin and the Huntress were later retconned as never existing in this continuity.</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>After the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>, the JSA experience significant changes in their lives which led to another battle to save the world. Green Lantern, Flash, Hawkman, Hourman, Atom, Doctor Mid-Nite, Johnny Thunder, Starman, Sandman, Wildcat and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sandman/29-9292/\">Sand</a> agreed to battle gods for eternity in limbo to prevent the end of the world. They escaped, but in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zero-hour/39-40782/\">Zero Hour</a>, the villain <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/extant/29-2030/\">Extant</a> killed Atom, Hourman, and Dr. Mid-Nite.

They fought crime for a long time, with miscellaneous enemies. The greatest event and challenge was the event Darkness, where Mordru, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/obsidian/29-9359/\">Obsidian</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eclipso/29-3763/\">Eclipso</a> tried to plunge the world into eternal night.</p><p>Recently, a vigilante group consisting of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-adam/29-4916/\">Black Adam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eclipso/29-3763/\">Eclipso</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northwind/29-4923/\">Northwind</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brainwave-jr/29-9319/\">Brainwave</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atom-smasher/29-4921/\">Atom-Smasher</a> took the law into their own hands. They started a violent coup in the terrorist nation of Kandaq to end the JSA. This also exposed that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-mind/29-9336/\">Mister Mind</a> was manipulating the JSA. This was called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jsa-black-reign/39-56176/\">Black Reign</a>, and it greatly affected the JSA. It caused Captain Marvel to quit.

Coming home to find that Obsidian has covered the entire house in his shadow locking in Jay Garrick, Wildcat, Allan Scott, and Liberty Belle. Obsidian would not explain why he put the house in lockdown other than a threat has occurred and is a \"ghost\". Stargirl from the outside of the Brownstone and Alan Scott from the inside are able to cast away Obsidian's shadows and the team regroups in the meeting hall as Obsidian fades away as this is</p><p>happening a strange purple mist washes over Jay, Alan Wildcat, Liberty Belle, and Hourman. He reveals himself as Kung a warrior of Japan from War World Two who fought Jay, Alan, and Ted in the war and was killed in Hiroshima and is acting revenge with his spirit.

Only to have it interrupted by Spectre who defeats and destroys Kung and than returns the JSA home.</p><p>One day, they mysteriously found a large black egg, which was revealed to be Obsidian. The Society, with new members All-American Kid, and King Chimera have little time to ponder over it, as they are soon attacked by a large group of villains, headed by Blue Moon. They attack them, while avoiding to fight Stargirl, who their boss had strictly ordered them not to attack. The All-American Kid and King Chimera stay behind in their room, which they share, until the Kid ominously walks up, goes to find Mr. Terrific, and stabs him. He then steals Obsidian and gives it to an unknown source. He is thought to be</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"896239\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/896239-terrific_super.jpg\" title=\"Mr.Terrific Left For Dead.\"><img id=\"896239\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/896239-terrific_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mr.Terrific Left For Dead.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mr.Terrific Left For Dead.</div></div></div></div><p>dead, but is revived by the new Dr. Fate, who has now joined the team. The attacker was indirectly thought to be King Chimera, as he has mental illusion powers. It was revealed, however, that was the All American Kid, as he was actually the villain Kid Karnevil. The JSA continues to fight the group of villains, until they retreat. Hourman and Liberty Belle then decide that they can't work together as a team anymore, and they split up into two teams. Green Lantern and The Flash lead one team, while Power Girl and Magog rename their half of the team the JSA All-Stars. JSA base is in a cave and the All Stars are in Ricks dad's house. The Brownstone being destroyed in the battle the Team moves into an abandoned JLA base outside the City.</p><h3>Mordru Attacks</h3><p>Not long after moving into their new base Dr. Fate has officially become a new member of the JSA.

The Dark Sorcerer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mordru/29-4904/\">Mordru</a> comes to the base in energy form and take possession of Fate's body and with begins plotting a take over of the JSA. But his strange behavior is enough for the team to know he is not Dr. Fate so they attack him and as Mordru leaves Fate's body Fate is left on the floor crippled and helpless to help his friends. Mordru being in his own physical form quickly cast an array of transportation spells casting each Society member into a pocket dimension hidden in a cardboard box. Each dimension holds a personal hell for whichever member is in that particular box. He stores them away so he can fight and kill each member when he sees fit he first chooses Alan Scott and they wage battle in orbit above the Earth. But as Alan Scott and Mordru Battle Dr. Fate is able to muster up the strength to go and save his friends. He does so by reaching into each cardboard box and pulling them out. Back out in space Alan is able to bring Mordu out of orbit back to Earth where the JSA is waiting and together they defeat him and cast him into his own made pocket dimensions.</p><h3>Return of The Fourth Reich and Destruction of The JSA</h3><p>Twenty years in the future we see Mr. Terrific being interviewed by a woman in a dark room.

Then back at the base the rest of the JSA are interviewing Kid Karnevil, who is still in their detention. He keeps going on about how they will all die and that his team is on their way to the base now. They dismiss it as the rantings of a madman and go on with the interrogation. They get word that a strange package has been delivered. Alan goes to check it out, only for it to blow up in in his face, causing splintering wood to pierce every part of his body, killing him instantly. Then the Fourth Reich storm in and begin wrecking the place. Wildcat confronts <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-nazi/29-24925/\">Captain Nazi</a>, who easily swats him away, killing him on impact.

In the battle with the new villain, the Society ends up destroying the city due to the strength of this new adversary. Feeling responsible, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Flash</a> (Jay Garrick) vows the team will remain in Monument Point until the city is rebuilt and on it's feet again. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-scott/29-12663/\">Green Lantern</a> (Alan Scott) is rendered paralyzed following this skirmish and hospitalized.</p><p>It is later revealed by United States Senator Eagen, an official that became involved following the mass destruction, that Garrick and Scott played a part in Scythe's creation. During a covert operation that the twosome were on in World War II, Scott and Garrick were charged with destroying a weapon. When this weapon turned out to be a child, they decided to let him live. This child would grow to become Scythe. Garrick, who has assumed de facto leadership of the depleted Justice Society, feels even more at fault and vows to turn Monument Point around. Freelance heroes such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-devil/29-4845/\">Blue Devil</a> arrive and help out with the rebuilding and protection of what remains of the city.</p><p>Corruption within the mayor's office seems evident as an official is seen meeting with another new villain whose codename is Dr. Chaos. Chaos lives up to his name by seemingly murder the mayor of Monument Point and Justice Society member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lightning/29-52271/\">Lightning</a> without even fighting them physically. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-fate-kent-v-nelson/29-5898/\">Dr. Fate</a> saves Lightning's soul and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jsa-all-stars/65-57325/\">JSA All-Stars</a> arrive as backup for the crumbling team.

        "description":"<h2><strong>Origin</strong></h2><p>It all started in 1941, when we asked <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-victory/29-1342/\">Joan Wayne</a> (a Washington DC secretary) to be part of a research team. She was the assistant of Dr. Mark Benton at the Colorado Project. The objective sought by the team, under the governance of president <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-d-roosevelt/29-31595/\">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, was to find a way to improve human abilities. They were asked to create the <u>perfect</u> soldier. The research progressed well until the moment when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remember-pearl-harbor/49-30283/\">Pearl Harbor</a> was bombed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-japanese-army/65-56574/\">Japanese</a> military, December 7. The war was truly present for the Americans and Roosevelt wanted to find a way to win.</p><p>Dr. Benton had created a chemical compound, the V-45. With this experimental vitamin they hoped to produce a \"fighting\" machine with accelerated cellular regeneration. Eager to have concrete results, the president asked Dr. Benton to make test directly on humans. This request was out of his personal values and he refused to proceed. He was then replaced by Joan Wayne at the head of the project. Her assistant was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/octavia-howard/29-72502/\">Octavia Howard</a>.</p><p>Despite several attempts, Joan Wayne couldn't make a compound without adverse side effects. Then one day she made the V-47, which worked perfectly on her body chemistry. Addition to the super strength and invulnerability, the V-47 allows her to restore her youth for periods of time. With this new powers, she left her works as a scientist. She became a super agent for the government of the United States, under the name of Miss Victory.</p><p>One day, during the mission \"Green Mist\", Joan met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rio-rita/29-27275/\">Rio Rita</a>, a U.S. spy. After saving almost everyone, Joan took a plane to follow a Nazi airship responsible for the attack. Rio Rita accompanied her. Just before the takeoff, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightveil/29-1338/\">Blue Bulleteer</a> (Laura Wright) came to the airport and wanted to join them. It was the first meeting between Ms. Victory and the future Nightveil. During the flight, they spotted another person in pursuit of the airship. It was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-cat/29-6649/\">She-Cat</a>, who worked alone. After the landing, the four girls found themselves together in a Nazi laboratory. They defeated the evil and on the way back, they had the idea of forming a team.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1329289\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1329289-joan_escorting_super.jpg\" title=\"Joan and Mrs. Roosevelt\"><img id=\"1329289\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1329289-joan_escorting_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Joan and Mrs. Roosevelt\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Joan and Mrs. Roosevelt</div></div></div></div><p>So the idea was there but nothing was official or recognized yet. The first lady of the time, Mrs. Roosevelt, is the person who has intervened on their behalf. What happened? Mrs. Roosevelt was in her car during an outing, accompanied by Joan Wayne (in her civilians clothes). Their car was waylaid by the 5th columnists and in a matter of seconds the guards were shot down. The 5th columnist is a group of people who clandestinely undermine a larger group such as a nation from within, to help an external enemy (Nazi's here). So Joan was the only person that can protect Mrs. Roosevelt. With her body invulnerable to bullets and her superhuman strength she quickly took care of all the attackers.</p><p>Mrs. Roosevelt was immensely grateful for this act of bravery. She browbeat her husband, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-d-roosevelt/29-31595/\">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, into making Ms. Victory and her females cronies national heroes. The President has officially formed this group of women as an auxiliary force for the nation.</p><h2>New recruits</h2><p>Throughout the four decades that followed, the group has had several changes in her workforce. Blue Bulleteer is first became <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightveil/29-1338/\">Nightveil</a>, with powerful magical power. Then there was the arrival of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/synn/29-6642/\">Synesthesia</a> (Silva Synn), whose LSD expanded psyche created psychedelic images. Rita Farrar became inactive but continued to work as undercover operative.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1322033\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1322033-new_ff_members_super.jpg\" title=\"New FemForce members\"><img id=\"1322033\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1322033-new_ff_members_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"New FemForce members\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">New FemForce members</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tara-fremont/29-6654/\">Tara Fremont</a> has one day helped the Femforce for a crucial mission in Amazon jungle. She was suppose to helped for one mission but she never left the team. She has been officially certified later, at the same time as Stardust (a former member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels-of-justice/65-56510/\">Sentinels of Justice</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderfox/29-48281/\">Thunderfox</a> (a former comic book character) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dragonfly/29-1343/\">Dragonfly</a> (Nancy Arazello).</p><p>When Ms. Victory became <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rad/29-6648/\">Rad</a>, she has been replaced as leader by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colt/29-30533/\">Colt</a>, a former agent. Few months later the daughter of Joan, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jennifer-wayne-burke/29-72455/\">Jennifer Wayne-Burke</a>, became the second Ms. Victory. She quickly replaced Colt as leader.</p><h2>Headquarters</h2><p>The team saw it headquarters location moved often over time. Initially they worked in government offices. But <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/general-robert-gordon/29-72564/\">General Robert Gordon</a>, who does not seem to like this team, has asked Joan Wayne to find a new headquarters on the pretext of lack of money.</p><p>They has been moved on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jungle-island/34-56957/\">Jungle Island</a> near the coast of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/florida/34-55740/\">Florida</a>. This island is a wildlife reserve owned by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tc-fremont/29-72420/\">T.C. Fremont</a>, father of Tara.</p><p>Then they were moved again in an old disused school in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/orlando-florida/34-56225/\">Orlando</a>, another T.C. Fremont property. Finally, when Jennifer Wayne-Burke became the 2nd Ms. Victory, Captain Tom Kelly was able to install them in a magnificent building at the cutting edge of technology, on the outskirts of Orlando.</p>",

Many of the members of the original Brigade had children, and they expected these children to eventually take up their parents' roles as superheroes. However, while the parents were competent and powerful superheroes, the members of the Inferior Five were incompetent, none of them able to fight crime without the assistance of the others.&nbsp;</div><div><h2>Creation</h2><div>The Inferior Five team was created in 1966 by <a href=\"/e-nelson-bridwell/26-42397/\">E.

After the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis</a>, the team appeared briefly alongside <a href=\"/angel-and-the-ape/49-2385/\">Angel and the Ape</a>, making no further major canon appearances, though they occasionally show up in the background. These appearances taken together suggest that the Inferior Five continues to exist in the post-Crisis universe.</div><div><h2>In Other Media</h2><div>The Inferior Five were referenced in the <i>Batman: The Brave and The Bold</i> episode \"Mayhem of the Music Meister!\" where their name appeared on a poster in the death trap scene.&nbsp;</div><div><h2>The Superior 5</h2><div>A team that was obviously based on the Inferior Five, called the <a href=\"/superior-5/65-56050/\">Superior 5</a>, made their debut in the pages of <i><a href=\"/villains-united/39-47133/\">Villains United</a></i>.

It all began with Seth Voelker (aka <a href=\"/sidewinder/29-13845/\">Sidewinder</a>), when he betrayed the Serpent Squad and took all the profit the team had made from finding the <a href=\"/serpent-crown/18-15780/\">Serpent Crown</a>. But those who had once followed him and been left for dead caught up with him. Boasting that he was much wealthier now and had ideas for what would become the Serpent Society, Sidewinder then promised <a href=\"/anaconda/29-19351/\">Anaconda</a>, <a href=\"/death-adder/29-13990/\">Death Adder</a> and <a href=\"/black-mamba/29-30719/\">Black Mamba</a> all the benefits his Society could offer, including better access to technology and jobs, higher pay, lodging and partners. But most important was the fact that with the help of Voelker's teleportation cloak, the members would never have to fear imprisonment again.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"855083\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6535/855083-sidewinderspeech_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"855083\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6535/855083-sidewinderspeech_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>After he convinced them and paid them their share of the reward, with interest, they contacted many other snake-themed supervillains to join the Society, most accepted, except for two. <a href=\"/constrictor/29-2127/\">Constrictor</a> was unimpressed and so he left trying to turn them over to the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/viper/29-3420/\">Viper</a> ( <a href=\"/madame-hydra/29-29532/\">Madame Hydra</a>) would not attend the initial meeting. Thus Sidewinder, Anaconda, Death Adder, Black Mamba, <a href=\"/asp/29-28880/\">Asp</a>, <a href=\"/diamondback/29-25689/\">Diamondback</a>, <a href=\"/cobra/29-11895/\">Cobra</a>, <a href=\"/bushmaster/29-30720/\">Bushmaster</a>, <a href=\"/cottonmouth/29-22584/\">Cottonmouth</a>, <a href=\"/rattler/29-30721/\">Rattler</a> and <a href=\"/princess-python/29-10859/\">Princess Python</a> became the charter members of the Society.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Serpent Society was created by <a href=\"/mark-gruenwald/26-41607/\">Mark Gruenwald</a> and <a href=\"/paul-neary/26-9570/\">Paul Neary</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/captain-america/49-2400/\">Captain America</a> #310 in October 1985.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The Serpent Citadel (the Society's headquarters) was originally located in New York City, at an abandoned mental hospital. They were sent out to contact various criminal organizations, their first assignment was to from <a href=\"/aim/65-13497/\">A.I.M.</a> who wished them to kill their former leader, <a href=\"/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a>. They succeeded and so were ranked as top-level criminals, <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> often attempted to intervene but could not put the Society out of commission. Two charter members left the Society, Death Adder was killed and Princess Python ran out on them during their MODOK assignment and so was expelled.</p><h3>Corruption</h3><p>Madame Hydra was not oblivious to the Serpent Society and she gathered agents to take it down and bring it under her control. She had <a href=\"/copperhead/29-11027/\">Copperhead</a>, <a href=\"/black-racer/29-41292/\">Black Racer</a>, <a href=\"/puff-adder/29-27471/\">Puff Adder</a> and <a href=\"/fer-de-lance/29-41199/\">Fer-de-Lance</a> infiltrate the Society and then <a href=\"/coachwhip/29-41198/\">Coachwhip</a>, <a href=\"/boomslang/29-42899/\">Boomslang</a>, <a href=\"/rock-python/29-42900/\">Rock Python</a> and <a href=\"/slither/29-14557/\">Slither</a> attacked the Serpent Citadel, the charter members betrayed Sidewinder and joined Viper but Bushmaster, Asp, Diamondback and Black Mamba remained loyal.</p><p>But the Viper used the Society, so that she could poison the water supply of Washington DC, transforming the citizens into snake-men and the capital was almost destroyed.</p><p>But Diamondback escaped with the help of Sidewinder to get help from Captain America, using sex to do this. Help also came in the form of his friends, <a href=\"/d-man/29-19960/\">D-Man</a>, <a href=\"/jack-monroe/29-7618/\">Nomad</a>, <a href=\"/vagabond/29-41288/\">Vagabond</a> and the <a href=\"/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a>.</p><p>They stormed Serpent Citadel where they proceeded to rescue the loyal members and capture the others. But Viper managed to escape, Cobra eventually subduing her. Cobra then tried to use her as a bargaining chip with Captain America but failed, so he turned her over anyway.</p><h3>Trial of Diamondback</h3><p>Sidewinder became bitter and so left the Society leaving King Cobra (formerly Cobra) to become the new leader of the team which expanded as all of Viper's agents minus Slither joined the team and the Society re-located to the Bronx.</p><p>Soon after Diamondback became romantically involved with Captain America and she began to desire him over the Society. He did not force her to betray the Society to him, but when the Society had surveillance put on her they discovered this relationship and she was put on trial for treason.</p><p>She was found guilty, the verdict, death by injection. The only members who did not vote for her death were future BAD Girls Inc. teammates Black Mamba and Asp as well as Bushmaster (a fellow Society member loyal to Sidewinder) and Rock Python.</p><p>King Cobra said the sentence would be dropped if she would tell them the civilian identity of Captain America, she refused. But she was rescued at the last moment when Black Mamba contacted Sidewinder to use his cloak to help her.</p><h3>Captain America</h3><p>Diamondback sought revenge and so she joined forces with <a href=\"/paladin/29-10584/\">Paladin</a> (after Captain America told her he could not guarantee immunity for Asp and Black Mamba). Paladin and Diamondback infiltrated the Serpent Society headquarters only to be captured along with Asp and Black Mamba. But Captain America, who was riding his sky cycle witnessed Fer-de-Lance and Cottonmouth heading to their headquarters on a Serpent Saucer.</p><p>Captain America followed them in and easily disposed of the two serpent-like super-villains. He united together with Paladin, Asp, Black Mamba and Diamondback after freeing them and the five took down the Society.</p><p>All members were brought to prison minus the three who helped Captain America plus Anaconda, Puff Adder, Rock Python and Boomslang as they were not at the headquarters at the time.</p><h3>Current Existence</h3><p>After some time in prison the Society got back together but their alliance seemed to have been permanently destroyed by Captain America and <a href=\"/force-works/65-14245/\">Force Works</a>, this being confirmed by both Black Mamba and Puff Adder.</p><p>However they had re-formed themselves yet again during the <a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a> crisis when the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> went insane after learning of the fate of her children. At that time, Diamondback enlisted Black Mamba and Asp to reform the Serpent Society to track down the <a href=\"/life-model-decoy/18-42286/\">LMD</a> Diamondback that Captain America was apparently dating at the time. Captain America fought his way free of their captivity and SHIELD took the Society into custody.</p><p>Despite several of the members working with other groups such as the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a> or the <a href=\"/six-pack/65-43900/\">Six Pack</a>, the Serpent Society continued to function as a team, appearing both in <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a> - when they barricaded themselves and some hostages into a compound in Danzig, Ohio - and briefly battling the <a href=\"/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2264829\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/113189/2264829-asp.png\" title=\"The newest Society\"><img id=\"2264829\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/113189/2264829-asp_medium.png\" alt=\"The newest Society\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The newest Society</div></div></div></div><p>A new line-up later appeared in <a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/39-56674/\">Avengers vs. X-Men</a>. The team pulled off a bank robbery in San Francisco, taking a number of employees hostage. Using the bound and gagged captives as a way to keep the cops away, the Society nearly succeeded in pulling off the heist, only to have their plan foiled by <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope Summers</a>. The young mutant defeated each of the Society members before turning them over to the police.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><p><b>Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</b></p><p>The Serpent Society appears in the episode, \"Ultron-5.\" The membership includes King Cobra, Anaconda, Bushmaster, Rattler, and Death Adder. The group holds civilians hostage in a subway station, but are attacked by the Avengers. Ant-Man, claiming that King Cobra and other members of the Society were under his care, tried to reason with the group. However, after a battle, King Cobra, Anaconda, and Rattler escaped. Death Adder was defeated by Hawkeye, and he and Bushmaster were likely taken into custody.</p>",

In order to make sure that the Martians never again rediscover their burning origins, the Guardians split them into two distinct races and instilled both of them with a deep weakness and fear of fire. Thus the two Martian races were born: The <a href=\"/white-martians/65-11285/\">White Martians</a>, and the <a href=\"/green-martians/65-30878/\">Green Martians</a>.</p><h2>Twin Races</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"334902\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/17744/334902-182175-white-martians_super.jpg\" title=\"White Martians\"><img id=\"334902\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/17744/334902-182175-white-martians_medium.jpg\" alt=\"White Martians\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">White Martians</div></div></div></div><p>Over the following millennia, the Green and White Martians evolved and developed next to each other. The Green Martians developed into a peaceful civilization of philosophers, while the White Martians became savage war-mongers. The two races squabbled constantly. Both races called their home planet Ma'aleca'andra.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"88521\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88521-45171-martian-manhunter_super.jpg\" title=\"Martians and Saturnians\"><img id=\"88521\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88521-45171-martian-manhunter_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Martians and Saturnians\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Martians and Saturnians</div></div></div></div><p>Somewhere in that period, the two races created clones of themselves to serve as workers on the planet <a href=\"/saturn/34-56294/\">Saturn</a>. The clones of the Green Martians became Red Saturnians, while clones of the White Martians became White Saturnians. While the Green Martians treated their clones as equals, the White Martians treated their clones as slaves. So big was this rift that eventually it led to a civil war. The atrocities committed by the White Martians were so great that they forced the Green Martians to imprison their entire race in the Still Zone (possibly the same as the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a>). In the aftermath of the war, both races of Saturnians were given their freedom, and the Green Martians were left to reign supreme over Mars.</p><h2>Downfall</h2><p>The Green Martian civilization thrived for hundreds of years to come after the war. They explored space and other planets, even visiting Earth and inspiring the <a href=\"/egypt/34-55877/\">Egyptians</a> to build their massive pyramids. It was a prosperous time for them.</p><p>The story of their fall would begin with the birth of two twin brothers: <a href=\"/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">J'onn J'onzz</a> and <a href=\"/malefic/29-23009/\">Ma'alefa'ak</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1038521\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34226/1038521-martian_trial_super.jpg\" title=\"Ma'alefa'ak's trial\"><img id=\"1038521\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34226/1038521-martian_trial_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ma'alefa'ak's trial\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ma'alefa'ak's trial</div></div></div></div><p>Both brothers grew up to be Manhunters (Policemen), but Ma'alefa'ak was a sociopath, and soon found himself committing the most heinous crime in the Martian society: Mind rape. For this transgression, the Martian assembly removed his telepathic abilities, an act he did not understand and the source of his hatred towards his race. Now basically a cripple and branded a freak by others, Ma'alefa'ak turned to thoughts of vengeance. He soon created a deliverer of his wrath: a telepathic plague he called \"Hronmeer's curse,\" after the <a href=\"/hronmeer/29-58905/\">Martian God of death and art</a>. A plague which, as the only non telepathic Martian, only Ma'alefa'ak would survive.</p><p>Like fire, the plague sweeped across Mars, killing every Martian it came in contact with. And being immune, Ma'alefa'ak was enjoying the fruits of his labor, until finding out of another Martian who survived the plague: his brother, J'onn.</p><p>The brothers fought, and in the aftermath Ma'alefa'ak was supposedly killed, and J'onn was left as the last surviving Martian.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"751350\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/751350-justice_manhunter_full_super.jpg\" title=\"Manhunter of Mars\"><img id=\"751350\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/751350-justice_manhunter_full_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Manhunter of Mars\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Manhunter of Mars</div></div></div></div><p>It is unknown for how long J'onn j'onzz wandered the dead planet, losing his mind, until the human scientist Doctor Erdel unwittingly transported him to Earth.

It was Sgt. Rock who forged Easy Company into the legendary fighting unit it became, fighting its way through Sicily, <a href=\"/italy/34-55920/\">     Italy</a>, <a href=\"/france/34-55778/\">     France</a>, Belgium, Holland and ultimately, <a href=\"/germany/34-55777/\">     Germany</a>.</p><p>Nick-named the Combat-happy Joes, the men of Easy were as unique as their names. Corporal \"<a href=\"/bulldozer/29-11267/\">     Bulldozer</a>\" Nichols was Rock's second in command. Private Phil Mason hated the heat, but turned out to be a perfect \"<a href=\"/ice-cream-soldier/29-34249/\">     Ice Cream</a>\" soldier when it came to combat in freezing weather. A soft spoken History teacher became a \"<a href=\"/wildman/29-31284/\">     Wildman</a>\" when pushed too far, and a full blooded Apache Indian named \"<a href=\"/little-sure-shot/29-31114/\">     Little Sure Shot</a>\" was Easy's ace point man.</p><p>\" Four Eyes\" was Easy's spectacled sharp shooter, while \"<a href=\"/worry-wart/29-31281/\">     Worry Wart</a>\" was firmly convinced that every bullet had his name on it. When Bazooka man Zack Nolan lost an arm in combat and was sent Stateside, two misfits called \"<a href=\"/long-round/29-31283/\">     Long Round</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/short-round/29-31282/\">     Short Round</a>\" took his place as Easy's Bazooka men. Easy counted ex heavyweight boxing champ Jackie Johnson among its roster, as well as whistling Canary who cheered Easy with his perpetual song, and a \"<a href=\"/farmer-boy/29-31373/\">     Farmer Boy</a>\" who refused to let the war stop him from doing what he was born to do.</p><p>Dozens of others passed through Easy's ranks as the long tortuous months wore on: \"Sunny\" and \"Wee Willie\" and \"Heavy\" and \"Lonesome\" and \"Shaker\" and \"Beanpole\" were just some of the characters who were either wounded or killed in action along the way - proving that nothing was ever easy in Easy. It is unclear whether the members of Easy Company survived the War. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></p><h3>\n</h3> <h3>Post-Flaspoint</h3>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2117300\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/2117300-easy_co.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0Joe Rock's Easy Co\"><img id=\"2117300\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/2117300-easy_co_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0Joe Rock's Easy Co\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0Joe Rock's Easy Co</div></div></div></div>  Easy Co appears once again in the <a href=\"/men-of-war/49-42601/\"> <i>Men of War</i></a> series, this time lead by <a href=\"/joe-rock/29-79889/\">   Sgt.

        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>When the people who are supposed to be on the side of good are forced to do something they do not want, they are labeled traitors. That is what the Losers are, a group of EX- <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cia/65-55745/\">CIA</a> agents who on their last mission were ordered to do something that each member could not do. And in disobeying direct orders by their handler Max they are now the focus of everyone within the military and sought after by Max himself.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clay/29-5654/\">Clay</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jensen/29-5656/\">Jensen</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roque/29-5682/\">Roque</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cougar/29-5655/\">Cougar</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aisha/29-5657/\">Aisha</a> are the Losers going against the system that put them in a spot they were not willing to forfeit to they want nothing more than to get back at those who have wronged them. Each of them has a specific reason why they want Max dead, but all of them have one single thing in common they were all betrayed.</p><h2><i><b>The Members</b></i></h2><h3>Clay</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1156135\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156135-clay_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1156135\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156135-clay_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The \"leader\" of what has been dubbed the Losers. <i>All Clay wants is to find the man responsible for their downfall and turn into the Losers...Max. Clay is determined to figure out why they were dooped and left for dead by Max. Why would he send them on that mission, and why he tried to kill them when they failed. Clay and Aisha have a sort of temperamental relationship, either trying to kill each other or have sex these two are definitely what you would call a loving couple.</i></p><h3>Cougar</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1156136\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156136-cougar_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1156136\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156136-cougar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The Marksman, and silent comedian. Scarred by what he saw in the mission that led them to become the Losers, he is a very quiet man. He rarely speaks and only speaks openly to Jensen, Always wearing a cowboy hat he really is a cowboy as he is an excellent marksman.</p><h3>Jensen</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1156137\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156137-jensen_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1156137\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156137-jensen_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The hacker, gunner, smart ass of the team. He is at home in front of a computer hacking into places he shouldn't be, but he also is a caring man. Becoming very close to Cougar they form a brotherly bond. Always the ever loving man of a million laughs (or so he thinks) his brash attitude tends to get him into tight spots.</p><h3>Aisha</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1156134\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156134-aisha_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1156134\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/1156134-aisha_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The ghost within the group, when she speaks its never anything nice. Condescending, ill tempered and quite frankly shes a b!tch but she is definitely a essential member to this team. Her reasons behind being in this group of misfits are her own and she tells no one. She really doesn't like Jensen and makes it apparent any and every time he tries to \"woo\" her. She is skilled in demolitions and many if not all forms of weaponry. She is also built like an ox as she is able to fire a rpg from the hip without falling to the recoil.</p><h3>Pooch</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"130818\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1812/130818-9649-pooch_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"130818\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1812/130818-9649-pooch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The gunner and pilot of the group if its got two wings he can fly it...usually. A family man he is the most verbal about wanting out of all of what the Losers do wanting nothing more than to return to his family (a wife and two kids). But he knows if he returns before they repay Max that his family would be in danger. Always with a smile on his face he is somewhat eluding to the fact he is built like a tank, able to withstand torture. He along with all of the group is well-versed in the ways of weapons.</p><h3>Roque</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1114537\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/1114537-untitled_super.png\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1114537\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/1114537-untitled_medium.png\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The man of many faces, he is the shadow within the group. Never revealing more than what is necessary he is very stern and to the point. A scar on his right eye shows that he has seen many battles for his country. But what the team does't know is he is working for his own game, and has been from the very beginning.</p><h2>The Losers Feature Film</h2><p>In 2010, a movie adaptation of the comicbook was made starring Jeffery Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Columbus Short, \u00d3scar Jaenada and Jason Patric.</p><p>The movie stays almost identical to the first few issues of the comic spanning, the first six issues of the famed Vertigo comic. Some things were edited for the movie, especially the violence that is showed during the movie. Much of the action was all done with explosives rather than the death and gore, the comic had alot of violence but it too didnt show many scenes of gore and horror. The one scene that was extremely watered down was the scene in which the helicopter bringing the children home was shot down, within the comic tiny bodies are seen burning to ash an screams are shown. The movie showed almost nothing of this, something probably better for the movie in keeping it PG-13.</p>",
