        "description":"<h2><b>Origin</b></h2>The nascent Hand first formed about 800 years ago in feudal <a href=\"/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a>, as a reaction to the oppressive class system that characterized Japanese society in that period. A number of Japanese citizens left their homes and settled in the mountains. There, they cultivated skill in ninjutsu, and through rigorous training became experts at assassination and espionage. The group officially came together in 1588 under the command of <a href=\"/kagenobu-yoshioka/29-1798/\">Kagenobu Yoshioka</a>, who turned his samurai school into a bastion of support for the common man. Yoshioka was eventually assassinated, and command of the group co-opted by the <a href=\"/snakeroot/65-56349/\">Snakeroot</a>, an ancient ninja clan who turned the Hand to demon worship and black magic. The Hand began working as mercenaries, and sought to extend its influence throughout the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h2>Creation</h2>The Hand was created by <a href=\"/frank-miller/26-7082/\">Frank Miller</a>. &nbsp;<br /><h2>Team Evolution&nbsp;</h2>The Hand consists largely of unknown masked people, but has featured numerous named characters at various points in its history. Throughout its history various heroes have been press-ganged into service by the dark magic of the Hand. They have also employed numerous villains.<br /><h2>Major Story Arcs&nbsp;</h2><h3>The Chaste &nbsp;</h3>The Hand comes into constant conflict with a heroic group known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"/chaste/65-55828/\">Chaste</a>. This conflict is the first encounter with the Hand experienced by both <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a>, with the latter first infiltrating and later joining the Hand for a time. The conflict eventually results in the defeat of the Hand, but also in the deaths of the Chaste's leader, <a href=\"/stick/29-11018/\">Stick</a>, and a member of the group named <a href=\"/shaft/29-5182/\">Shaft</a>.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Enemy of the State &nbsp;</h3>The Hand, alongside scion organization <a href=\"/hydra/65-3480/\">HYDRA</a> and the mutant group Dawn of the White Light, orchestrates the abduction of <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. They brainwash him, and set him loose, intending to use him as the weapon he was designed to be to kill members of the superhero community. They send numerous operatives out across the world to deal with opponent superheroes, with limited success. They manage to kill and resurrect Elektra and <a href=\"/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a>, both of whom are brainwashed to act as weapons for the Hand and HYDRA. Meanwhile, Wolverine escapes his brainwashing and turns on the Hand, commandeering a <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a> and invading their headquarters, destroying many of the Hand's members, as well as the organization's elite, with the assistance of Elektra, who had also managed to escape her conditioning.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Shadowland</h3>Daredevil takes over command of the Hand after the Hand's repeated attempts to acquire a new warlord. He constructs a new headquarters for them in <a href=\"/hells-kitchen/34-42295/\">Hell's Kitchen</a>, called <a href=\"/shadowland/34-57004/\">Shadowland</a>, and dedicates himself into remodelling the group into a force for good. The group begins to corrupt him instead. After Daredevil kills <a href=\"/bullseye/29-4647/\">Bullseye</a>, he and members of the Hand crash the funeral and engage in a massive brawl which almost results in the death of the captive <a href=\"/ben-urich/29-4799/\">Ben Urich</a>. After a number of clashes between the Hand and the members of the superhero community, it is revealed that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic <a href=\"/the-beast/29-61555/\">Beast of the Hand</a>. He is defeated and apparently kills himself; in the ensuing confusion, control of the Hand is seized by <a href=\"/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> and <a href=\"/typhoid-mary/29-1536/\">Typhoid Mary</a>.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film &nbsp;</h3><b><i>Elektra</i></b>&nbsp;<br />The Hand appears as a the major antagonistic organization in this film.<br /><h3>Video Games&nbsp;</h3><b><i>X-Men vs Street Fighter&nbsp;</i></b><br />The Hand appears briefly and attempts to draw <a href=\"/cammy/29-42698/\">Cammy</a> into their organization.<br /><b><i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i></b>&nbsp;<br />The Hand appears as an antagonistic organization in this game. &nbsp;<br /><b><i>Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3</i></b><br />Members of the Hand appear, as does the Hand's headquarters and Shadowland.&nbsp;<br /><b><i>Marvel: Avengers Alliance&nbsp;</i></b><br />Various members of the Hand appear in this game.&nbsp;",

Soon afterward, the wall of his cell was blown out and he was approached by Cyclops, who presented him with an offer to join the academy. He was given the name Iceman after his power to manipulate moisture and create ice.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Henry \"Hank\" McCoy</a>, born in Dunfee, Illinois to Norton and Edna McCoy was a genius with the brutish look. He excelled in athletics due to his physical nature but also studies profusely. When he began to attract animosity for his appearance and mutation, he was approached by Xavier to join his school. Hank took the name \"Beast\" as his mutation granted him larger hands and feet, much like a gorilla and super strength to match.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Warren Kenneth Worthington III</a> was already a costumed crime fighter in his own right who went by the name \"the Avenging Angel.\" He was born to millionaire parents and was kept in a private school, forced to hide his physical mutation. He was recruited by Professor X and he retained the codename \"Angel\" due to his large feathery wings.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> was already a student (of sorts) of Professor X prior to the formation of the X-Men. After experiencing the death of her best friend, Annie, her telepathic powers were activated, forcing the young mutant to feel and sense her friend's passing. She was coached and helped by the Professor as he locks her powers away to keep her safe. As she develops telekinetic gifts she is invited to the school to become the sole female addition to the team. She takes the name \"Marvel Girl.\"</li></ul><p>The students are trained to use their gifts by Professor X who deems them the X-Men due to their extra abilities. The team becomes a tightly knit group, growing up from teenagers and learning to properly use their powers. Their first mission is against the evil mutant, <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, who is the self proclaimed \"Master of Magnetism.\" He attacked Cape Citadel and the X-Men prevented any damage or casualties.</p><p>During the initial run of X-Men they face Magneto's <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, the teleporting <a href=\"/vanisher/29-6756/\">Vanisher</a>, the villainous Factor Three and the alien <a href=\"/lucifer/29-14468/\">Lucifer</a>. Early in the series, Professor X is presumed dead and it is learned that he had been replaced, at his request, by the Changeling, a villain who wished to reform his criminal ways. The X-Men are also joined by the mutant Mimic, who has the ability to utilize up to five mutant abilities at a time. Mimic sought out the X-Men in an attempt to make his powers permanent, but was defeated and became an ally for a short time. The team was then joined by two new recruits; Havok, the plasma generating brother of Cyclops; and Polaris, the green haired, magnetism manipulating future confirmed daughter of Magneto.

Stan Lee created the title 'X-Men' when publisher <a href=\"../../martin-goodman/26-43801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Goodman</a> turned down the original name ' The Merry Mutants' because he felt that people would not understand what a mutant actually was. Throughout the Marvel Universe, it is believed that the X-Men were named after Professor Xavier, their mentor but it is claimed that they were actually named after the X-Gene, the gene that created mutants.</p><p>One of the reasons for creating X-Men was the amount of mail Marvel was getting from the readers demanding a new superhero team because of all the solitary heroes in Marvel roster. Stan Lee wanted the heroes to have similar origin background, and because \"I could not get everyone bitten by radioactive spider\", Lee came up with the \"Homo Superior\" concept.</p><p>Some have pointed out that it is possible that the team was inspired by <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a>' Doom Patrol. At the time <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> was a new force on the comics scene and took a lot of its motivation and inspiration from DC (for instance the Fantastic Four were patterned after the <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown/65-16341/\">Challengers of the Unknown</a>). The similarities between numerous characters, and especially Professor X to <a href=\"/the-chief/29-35126/\">the Chief</a> have led to this speculation.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>The Early Years</h3><p>The Silver and early Bronze ages of comics published stories more in line with the standard at the time, meaning issues that consisted of self contained stories with little overall development of characters. One of the developments of Marvel is that the company became much more interested in character development, but this change was slow and the early years of the X-Men were marred with the same problems as other comics, if perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><h3>Late 70's</h3><h3>Deadly Genesis/Giant-sized X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"13286\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"All New All Different\"><img id=\"13286\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"All New All Different\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">All New All Different</div></div></div></div><p>The first big shake-up for the team came when the original team (plus Havok and Polaris, minus Beast) were abducted by the living island of Krakoa. First Professor X sent a brand new team of untried students trained by <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a>. This team included Kid Vulcan, Darwin, Sway,and Petra, but they were quickly overtaken by the island. Petra and Sway were killed but Vulcan was left in suspended animation (partially due to Darwin's powers). When Krakoa released Cyclops to bring more mutants to feed on, Professor X gathered several young mutants who already had experience in their powers: Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Thunderbird, Sunfire, and Banshee. Due to Professors X's mental manipulations, Vulcan's team was completely forgotten and Storm's team became known as the X-Men second generation. Following this mission, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Havok, and Lorna Dane (as well as Sunfire) all left the team allowing the remaining new members and Cyclops to become the new X-Men.</p><h3>New X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833613\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix Rises\"><img id=\"1833613\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phoenix Rises</div></div></div></div><p>The\nnewly formed team was comprised of diverse but strong personalities, making\nthem very different from the original team. The\nnew team consisted of adults rather than impressionable teenagers, and both Scott and\nXavier found it challenging to get the team to work together. On their second mission, the team battled Count Nefaria, and despite earlier warnings, Thunderbird had sacrificed himself for his teammates, and became the first X-Man to die in the line of duty. Subsequent missions had also put the new team against former X-Men members such as Havok and Lorna Dane (now going by the name of Polaris), who were under the influence of Shi\u2019ar agent Eric the Red, and Kierrok and his N\u2019gari. It was during these early periods that readers got their first glimpses of Moira MacTaggert, <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, and <a href=\"/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a>.</p><p>During a Christmas trip to New York City, the X-Men and Marvel Girl were attacked by <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>, which led to the capture of Jean, Banshee and Wolverine. The remaining X-Men were dispatched to space to save the Starcore space station and their teammates. The team was attacked by Erik the Red, and robot duplicates of the original team along with Havok and Polaris. On the escape back to Earth, the spaceship was badly damaged and could not be piloted through use of auto pilot. After telepathically absorbing the information necessary to pilot\nthe ship from Dr. Peter Corbeau, Marvel Girl volunteered to fly the ship back\nto Earth. She assumed that by creating a psionic shield of telekinetic energy she would be safe, and simultaneously forced Cyclops to sleep as she flew the ship back to Earth. Unfortunately, her body could not handle the strain and she perished. The ship landed in the Hudson Bay with all the X-Men safe, but they could not find Jean. While searching for Jean, she emerged from the river in a completely different costume and a fiery voice, and declared a new identity as the Phoenix. The team was uneasy but grateful that Jean had survived, but they quickly noticed that her powers were much more than they were before. She easily performs feats that she was never able to as Marvel Girl.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Immediately after, the team (except Scott and Charles who were looking after Jean) battled the <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> and Black Tom Cassidy in Ireland, but before they were defeated, Jean as the Phoenix saved them. The team then faced foes such as Magneto, which saw the division among the team, and each side thought that the other had perished; Moses Magnum, who held Japan hostage and cost Banshee his mutant power; Proteus, the reality warping son of Moira MacTaggart who was killed by the soft hearted Colossus. There was also a mission in the Shi\u2019ar galaxy to defeat the mad Emperor D\u2019Ken. Here, the Phoenix the potential of her power by binding the neutron galaxy inside the M\u2019Kraan Crystal.</p><p>Line-up:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/vulcan/29-21233/\">Kid Vulcan</a>, <a href=\"/darwin/29-40600/\">Darwin</a>, <a href=\"/petra/29-40854/\">Petra</a> and <a href=\"/sway/29-40855/\">Sway</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a>, <a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a>, <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a>, <a href=\"/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a> and <a href=\"/banshee/29-9708/\">Banshee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../thunderbird/29-2174/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunderbird</a> and <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a> and <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Phoenix</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Phoenix</a></li></ul><h2>Early 80\u2019s</h2><h3>Dark Phoenix</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"154910\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix_super.jpg\" title=\"Dark Phoenix\"><img id=\"154910\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Phoenix\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dark Phoenix</div></div></div></div><p>In one of the most well-known X-Men stories, Jean Grey began to lose control over her powers and personality. She became much more aggressive in dealing with wrong doers. While saving the mutant <a href=\"/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a> from a <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> task force, she completely dismantled a car with ease. During this time, the team had recruited a young mutant from Deerfield, Illinois named Katherine \"Kitty\" Pride. Kitty along with Storm, Colossus and Wolverine are captured by the Hellfire Club and held hostage but was eventually rescued through the efforts of an escaped Kitty and the remaining X-Men. The members of the Hellfire Club's inner circle witnessed a sample of Phoenix's power and plotted on brain washing her into becoming a member. A former member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, <a href=\"/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, was primarily responsible for the psychic seduction of Jean Grey. He initiated \"time slips\" to convince her that she was living in the past as his lover. Jean goes to the club and became fully entranced under Masterminds mind control. The X-Men attempted to intervene, but it only led to their capture with the exception of Wolverine, who makes a famous stand against the club's security and Inner Circle. Jean eventually overpowered Mastermind, and through the powers of the Phoenix, she put his mind in touch with the universe, which essentially overwhelmed his mind into catatonia. Her actions had caused her to become overwhelmed by her own powers, thus transforming her into the Dark Phoenix.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833617\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833617-831402_dofp_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine and Katherine\"><img id=\"1833617\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833617-831402_dofp_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine and Katherine</div></div></div></div><p>After defeating the X-Men and heading to space where she destroyed a star system, Dark Phoenix returned to Earth. The X-Men had allied with the newly deputized <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, and Beast confronts Jean in an attempt to calm and help her. The teams are quickly defeated, but Professor X, aided with the help of Jean Grey, defeated the Phoenix persona. Once he won, the X-Men were interrupted by Lilandra and the Shi'ar imperial guard. As empress, Lilandra is bound by Shi'ar laws to kill the Phoenix for the crimes she had committed against their empire, which was the \"eating\" of a star, and condemning a planetary system in death. The team is transported to the Blue Area of the Moon and Xavier reads Lilandra's mind and invokes Arin'n Haelar, a duel of honor that cannot be denied. The X-Men face off against the Imperial Guard of the Shi'ar. Once the X-Men are defeated, Jean lost control of her powers and personality, and the Dark Phoenix persona arises. Before Lilandra could order the destruction of the solar system to prevent Phoenix from becoming a threat again, Professor X instructed the X-Men to subdue Jean. Once she regained her senses, Jean used a Kree weapon to commit suicide.</p><h3>Days of Future Past</h3><p>With the death of Jean Grey, Cyclops left the team and Angel returned. Professor X promoted Storm to team leader and they welcomed Kitty Pride, now codenamed Sprite, onto the team. In an attempt to deter an assassination plot on <a href=\"/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Kelly</a> by Mystique's Brotherhood of Mutants, Kitty's psyche had switched with that of an alternate time line. In that time line, the world is ruled by Sentinels, and mutants were sent to internment camps and killed. Most of the known X-Men at the time had perished with the exception of Colossus, Storm, Wolverine and Magneto. They were joined with the son of <a href=\"/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>, and the daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey, <a href=\"/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a>. In order to prevent the apocalyptic future, Kitty traveled back to the past to prevent the death of Senator Kelly. She is successful, however, the alternate time line that she had encountered remained intact.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833618\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833618-663504_1_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The Brood\"><img id=\"1833618\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833618-663504_1_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Brood\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Brood</div></div></div></div><p>The next few months are tumultuous for the X-Men.

The X-Men, along with house guest <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a>, traveled to space with the Starjammers and were kidnapped by Lilandra\u2019s sister <a href=\"/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a> and the terrifying <a href=\"/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a>. This lead to Danvers being transformed into the cosmically powered Binary and the X-Men almost being transformed into Brood creatures themselves. The X-Men returned to Earth to destroy the Brood embryo inside Professor X and discover that in their absence, the Professor has gathered a new group of young mutants, the New Mutants. Kitty was briefly demoted to the junior team until she proved herself against a Sidri Hunter on her own.</p><h3><b>Morlocks</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\"><img id=\"1833621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Callisto and the Morlocks</div></div></div></div><p>The X-Men discovered that Angel had been kidnapped by a community of underground dwelling mutants calling themselves <a href=\"/morlocks/65-3191/\">Morlocks</a> and led by a fierce woman named <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a>.

During their stay in Japan, Storm spends time with a thief, <a href=\"/yukio/29-9843/\">Yukio</a>, and sees drastic changes to her looks and personality. She adopts a more punk look, cutting her incredibly long hair into a Mohawk and wearing leather and spikes. Combined with her Morlock vest, it is a vast change from her previous looks and temperament. During this time, Storm was rendered powerless by <a href=\"/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a>, who shot her with a gun used to suppress mutant gene's when aiming for her foster daughter, Rogue.</p><h3>The Summers Family Expands</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"808196\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/808196-madelyne_pryor1_super.jpg\" title=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\"><img id=\"808196\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/808196-madelyne_pryor1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Scott and Madelyne get married!</div></div></div></div><p>Around this same time, Scott married a woman named <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> who was the spitting image of Jean Grey.

He was slowly on the path to dying and refused to burden his students with it. At this point, he also invited Magneto to stay at the mansion with them as he had begun to repent for his past misdeeds. Also at this time, it was decided that Storm and Cyclops could no longer share the leadership responsibilities and there must be a decision made.

The <a href=\"../../legacy-virus/12-42281/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus</a> was a disease that attacked only mutants and caused their powers to become powerfully out of control to a fatal end. The virus hit close to home with mutants suffering that had close ties to the X-Men like Pyro, <a href=\"../../revanche/29-9709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Revanche</a> and Colossus' young sister Illyana Rasputin. Illyana, who had been reverted to childhood following the events of the Inferno, was still a latent mutant in her current form and was the first casualty of the virus. It hit Colossus hard as he had just lost both of his parents soon before. The X-Men held a vigil in her honor with all X-Teams in attendance to mourn her death. Wishing to pay his respects and offer asylum to any and all mutants interested, Magneto crashed the funeral in a show of misplaced aggression. He attacked the X-Teams and if not for the intervention of Colossus, would have lost.

In one of the most shocking moments in comic history, he aggressively fights Wolverine and rips out his adamantium skeleton. The Professor decides that enough is enough and his former friend cannot be saved and wipes his mind. Jean Grey then takes over leadership and forces the team back to the craft while keeping the Professor breathing and Wolverine alive. In the end, Wolverine is left in a feral state with very little active healing ability and unsure of his life and purpose.</p><p>With the Acolytes now in a power struggle, <a href=\"../../fabian-cortez/29-9728/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabian Cortez</a> assumes leadership over Magneto's followers. He kidnaps Magneto's granddaughter and daughter to Quicksilver and the Avenger, <a href=\"../../crystal/29-2115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal</a> and claims her in the name of Magneto. This enrages the Avengers and the X-Men who join forces to save <a href=\"/luna/29-10962/\">Luna</a> and take back Genosha.

Later while fighting Sentinels the team recruited Iceman. The Brotherhood of Mutants sent a spy to infiltrate the X-Men group to kill Professor X. They sent Wolverine. Magneto, The Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, <a href=\"../../toad/29-1470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toad</a>, Multiple Man, the <a href=\"../../blob/29-3182/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blob</a> and Mastermind form the Brotherhood and they had kidnapped the President\u00b4s daughter. The X-Men saved her and in the last moment Wolverine had a change of heart and instead of killing Xavier he tried to kill Magneto, while he sent Sentinels to kill humans. In the end Xavier killed Magneto with the help of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.</p><p>Xavier then started helping Wolverine to find out where were the people who gave him the metal implants. <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-50418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a> did all the implants and they found it. Then the X-Men were abducted by Weapon X and were tortured and they even made Beast blue.</p><p>Ultimate <a href=\"../../alpha-flight/65-14616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Flight</a> arrived and seemingly kill Iceman and now the X-Men face these strange super powered team. Beast puts Iceman back together but Alpha Flight arrive to take Northstar, something that Colossus isn't very happy about. Alpha Flight was under the influence of a power enhancing drug called <a href=\"../../banshee/18-55849/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a>. Taking <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a> had Colossus so mad Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Rouge and him went after Alpha Flight. Cyclops went along to prevent anything stupid from happening. The <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a> appeared into the picture and caused the death of Northstar. Colossus and the rest of the people who went along went under Banshee drug and enhanced their powers. Dazzler could maneuver her powers to create anything, Rouge could keep the power she absorbed, Nightcrawler could go to greater lengths, Colossus became stronger, and Cyclops could control his eye beams and fly.</p><p>Jean Grey had taken it into her own hands to lead the X-Men and she was driving them around pretty hard. Nightcrawler contacted her saying that they needed help from themselves because they were addicted to the power enhancer. Wolverine had figured out that he was positive to have been dosed with Banshee so he went to <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker</a> for help to sort things out. Kitty and Peter were dealing with Banshee addicts themselves when Wolverine arrived. Peter explained that he was positive because he was Banshee the drug was made by taking properties of him. The X-Men went after the addicted X-Men and fought it off. Jean went off for a moment while she talked to her father as Phoenix when then she fell unconscious. Logan blamed Colossus for it so he took his heart out for it.</p><p>Both X-Men embark on a flight until Phoenix stops it all. Everyone cools down for the exception of Cyclops that flies to the moon. During the fight Wolverine looses a leg to Colossus. Phoenix show to Colossus that Northstar is okay except that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Colossus and Wolverine are fixed up by Jean after that and then Jean heads to the moon. Wolverine using some of the Banshee Colossus bought he tracked it down to Muir Island blaming Xavier for it. Jean talked to Scott and after that he said he wanted to keep the power the Banshee started wearing off so she put his glasses back on. The Prof. was who created Banshee from Wolverine along with Magneto but Moira distributed it. She fought Wolverine with her \"Screaming\" powers. In the end Wolverine destroyed the whole facility. Quicksilver then arrived an told Moira that Magneto had newer plans for the near future.</p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Rogue and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"../../ultimatum/39-55745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards. Then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a Sentinel from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverine Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually Scott. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over as Captain America after <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Rogers</a> aged 100 years, then he died. In the future Iceman was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be <a href=\"../../human-torch/29-2120/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny</a> he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"../../liz-allan/29-15408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops\u00b4s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. <a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben</a> and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue\u00b4s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother\u00b4s death. Everyone let the future hero\u00b4s free from a prison in the <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Negative Zone</a> Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-Men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that, that future would not happen.</p><p>In <a href=\"../../ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimate X-Men</a> #100 we find that The Academy of Tomorrow has been attacked by Madrox on behalf of Magneto. There are several multiples of Madrox with bombs strapped to their chest and when the Cyclops, Iceman and Rogue arrive the school is in flames and Northstar and Polaris are shown as dead.

Professor Xavier believes sociopath is the next step in human evolution. The X-Men are framed for killing their own member Jean Grey by way of three cuts over the back and face. Leader of the police force known as \" <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Brotherhood</a>\" named <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnus</a> is put in charge of the investigation. As the search for the X-Men continues more and more of them are found dead.

When he tells them to go to the police Scott responds. \"We're the X-Men, and no one is on our side\". Meanwhile a mysterious man in a bright red cape is investigating the crimes himself. After Warren Worthington is thrown from a roof top and Hank McCoy is shot and killed in a run in with The Brotherhood, Magnus orders the Brotherhood to take down <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a> (a powerful mob boss) and his Hellfire Club. Magnus believes with the X-Men out of his way and the Hellfire club killed off, the city will be \"his\". He meets with <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anne-Marie Rankin</a> to learn the whereabouts of the last few X-Men but she kills him instead. The caped figure later realizes that Jean Grey is not dead. What happened was that she killed Anne-Marie Rankin and took her place, because she wanted to avoid being studied by Xavier or exploited by Magnus. She then says she knows that the caped figure cannot kill her and pulls a gun on him but he then reveals that he is the twin brother of who she thinks he is and then pushes her off the roof causing them both to fall to their death. His twin, accompanied by Scott finds their bodies and says that he lost him years ago by what he had become. He recants about how when he and his brother both worked at a prison they started the whole cape thing because it made the inmates think he was in two places at the same time (making it seem like he has super powers).

There have also been rumors of an X-Men 4, Deadpool, and a New Mutants film. The films are loosely based on stories told in the comic books, and often focus on the same issues.

It is part of a tunnel system which extends into New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York state. <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a> first found the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> who had the power to psionically locate other mutants. Using <a href=\"/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> ability, <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a> located and gathered together many other mutants who had run away from human society. Many had been experiments of the evil geneticist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a> who arrived in this time-line from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a>, where he had worked under his reality's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>. &nbsp;The other founding members of the Morlocks include <a href=\"/masque/29-7252/\">Masque</a> who can rearrange a persons looks, and <a href=\"/sunder/29-7969/\">Sunder</a> the strongest of the initial group of Morlocks. Callisto herself not without a sense of humor named the loose knit group the Morlocks, after the&nbsp;H. G. Wells novel The Time Machine. Morlock's aren't always unified or even limited to New York, as their have been several splinter Morlock groups and groups of disaffected mutants from across the globe have adopted the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Creation</h2>The Morlocks are a <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel comics</a> creation and name given to an underground group of mutants who are disaffected and feel shunned by society. The Morlocks were created by writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont </a>and artist <a href=\"/paul-smith/26-2463/\">Paul Smith,</a> first appearing in&nbsp;<a href=\"/uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">Uncanny X-Men #169.</a> Their name is inspired by the&nbsp;<a href=\"/h-g-wells/26-60130/\">H. G. Wells</a> novel The Time Machine, which also features a similar group of underground beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Team Evolution</h2>There have been various Morlocks over time, often with multiple groups, coexisting alongside each other, with some groups membership swelling as others dwindle or vice versa. One of the first distinctions among the Morlocks, was with one group, the Tunnelers, who had grown dissatisfied with Callisto's main group of Morlocks, so splintered off. These Tunnelers&nbsp;consisting of Masque, <a href=\"/blow-hard/29-14474/\">Blow Hard,</a> <a href=\"/scaleface/29-12641/\">Scaleface,</a> and <a href=\"/berserker/29-36125/\">Berserker.</a> They lived in the underground tunnel section.

        "description":"<p>There have been several groups of mutant youths that have utilized the name the Hellions. The Hellions were/are in most cases the antithesis to the junior X-teams such as: the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/generation-x/65-15083/\">Generation X</a>, the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> and most recently the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> squad by the same name as the original, the New Mutants.</p><h2>The Original Hellions</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> began his quest to put together his second generation team of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, later dubbed the New Mutants. Initially, being that Xavier Institute was a school, it was simply a means to train young mutants in the use and responsibility of their powers. It evolved into becoming training grounds to become field trained and X-Men ready. The design was simple, in the event that the X-Men were not able to perform the New Mutants would fill the spot, which they eventually did. Unbeknown to Xavier, an organization caught wind of his activities and followed quickly after.This group was better known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>. The Hellfire Club is a sinister international group of the world's social elite. They are run by mutants that consider themselves superior to other mutants, in both their mutant abilities/powers and social status. They copied Xavier's design perfectly. They even had their own telepath, quite powerful at that, to front and run the school, by the name of Emma Frost then known as the White Queen.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"101511\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/101511-2979-hellions_super.jpg\" title=\"Original Hellions Additional members\"><img id=\"101511\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/101511-2979-hellions_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Original Hellions Additional members\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Original Hellions Additional members</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, the White Queen of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle, funded and purchased a private school in the Snow Valley, located in the Burkshire Mountains in Massachusetts. She named the private school, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/massachusetts-academy/34-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a>. She was the headmistress of the school, and it was here that she would train her future Hellions. Her intentions for the Hellions were, when fully trained, they would serve the interest of the Hellfire Club's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-inner-circle/29-34656/\">The Inner Circle</a>.</p><p>The Inner Circle seeks to amass absolute power and control, over all things political and economical, through both legal and illegal activities, any means necessary. The Hellions were to be the \"any means necessary.\" As such, Emma needed to seek out and recruit very specific mutants, with abilities that would further aid her organization and later herself. (As a note, Emma didn't truly do it all for the Hellfire Club. She did it to solidify her power in the club. For to mold and control the students, would mean she would control the future.) Her problem was that she couldn't let anyone get to them before her, especially Xavier. It was then that Emma had a computer, very similar to the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a>, created to amplify her mental talents. Once done, her search would begin. Once she located her potential students, she mentally hid their presence from all others until she could recruit them herself. In the order of the students acceptance of Emma's invitation to the academy:</p><ul><li>James Proudstar - Thunderbird (now known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warpath/29-2158/\">Warpath</a>): James was the younger brother of the X-Men <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a>. Super strong and durable he was the muscle of the team. His hatred for Xavier and the X-Men, as he blamed them for his brother's death and wanted revenge, only solidified his role on the team. His time with the Hellions would be limited. James would have a change of heart and eventually quit.</li><li>Sharon Smith - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/catseye/29-2138/\">Catseye</a>: The Hellions answer to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>. Catseye's youth and lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. Even more ferocious was she when fighting. Like Wolfsbane, Catseye was a metamorph though not into a wolf but into a cat. Catseye could morph into a lavender panther-like wildcat OR a transitional hybrid form granting her the best qualities of both a human and cat. Fiercely loyal she protected her friends to no end. But in reality she hardly understood the normal world prefer the life of a cat.</li><li>Emmanuel Alfonso Rodrigo De la Rocha - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empath/29-2173/\">Empath</a>: Empath was more like the White Queen then any other on the team. He was ruthless, cunning and willing to use his powers on anyone for personal gain. Empath's power (just like his name) was the ability to read, feel and control the emotions of others. He is able to perform this feat on individuals singly or on the city-wide level. Empath was one of Frost's favorites due to their similarities, also one of her biggest pains for the same reason. Empath would be the only member of the Hellions, actually present during their final battle with Fitzroy, to survive and leave the night unscathed. Due, largely in part, to his quick retreat once the Sentinel began their invade.</li><li>Haroum ibn Sallah al-Rashid - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jetstream/29-2143/\">Jetstream</a>: Jetstream shared powers and responsibilities similar to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, who could also propel himself through the air and was also team leader. Though, he didn't share his protective force field Cannonball generated during flight. Jetstream's body didn't have built in protections from the effects of his powers. When Jetstream would lift off the friction and force of the wind that he would fly through would flay his flesh and also cause severe burns or even catch him on fire. The Hellfire Club would remedy this and provide Jetstream with a bionic system that enabled more control, focus and protection from his powers. As a result, he pledged undying lifelong loyalty to them.</li><li>Jennifer Stavros - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roulette/29-2142/\">Roulette</a>: Born to a casino Poker card dealer in Atlantic City. She is the youngest of 8 children, because of this she never had her way. When her mutant gifts manifested things changed. She began running with a gang and breaking the law. She would surely have been arrested before being recruited as part of the Hellions. Roulette could alter the probability fields of good and bad luck. By creating discs of mental energy (red disc was good luck, black disc was bad luck) and throwing them at an individual or thing and action would always follow, depending on which disc she threw.</li><li>Marie-Ange Colbert - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarot/29-2140/\">Tarot</a>: Unlike some of her other more mean spirited teammates, Tarot was generally sympathetic and kind by nature. Tarot is a precog, with the ability to materialize and animate (purely of psionic energy) tangible, solid representation of the images on her tarot cards. Once created, she had full control of them and they would do battle for her or be used as a transportation device for the team. Her future was to be surrounded in mystery, and more lasting then many of the other Hellion teammates.</li></ul><p>With the final member's acceptance of the White Queen's invitation to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/massachusetts-academy/34-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a>, Emma's search would be over. These young mutants would represent the initial core group, The Hellions.</p><h2>Additional Members</h2><p>Others would join to replace members that would leave, or some would be added as ploys. These individuals included:</p><ul><li>The Fiery, on again, off again New Mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a> (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla).</li><li>The Bio-electrically charged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bevatron/29-2141/\">Bevatron</a> (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) would fill the slot Firestar would leave open.</li><li>The super strong, not so smart <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beef/29-2139/\">Beef</a> (Buford Wilson) would fill Thunderbird's eventual slot.</li><li>One other individual was offered a spot on the team but declined (revealed a lot later in the Marvel Continuity). Older brother of future X-Force member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jesse-bedlam/29-15329/\">Jesse Bedlam</a>/Aaronson, Christopher Terrance Bedlam/Aaronson, later known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-bedlam/29-15576/\">King Bedlam</a>. King Bedlam was gifted with the mutant talent to create telepathic static which could control bodily or mental functions, this gave him immunity to mental tampering. When he declined, tried as she might, not even Emma's telepathic persuasion could change his mind. And she tried HARD. Emma didn't take kindly to the word \"No.\" His short time with the team, while making his decision, led to a strong emotional tie with Tarot. They fell in love quickly and, in a still unclear way, the two lovers' souls somehow inextricably became bound together. This would lead to Tarot's later resurrection.</li><li>Finally there was the microwave manipulating, future Avenger <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a> (Angelica Jones). Emma never had intentions for Firestar to join or be apart of the main group. Emma along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, a time traveling mutant from the future, trained her separately and hidden from the others. Firestar was to be the White Queen's personal assassin due to Firestar's destructive and devastating nature of her mutant abilities. Her first mission was to, but never happened, kill the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club (at that time it was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/selene/29-2176/\">Selene</a>) who Emma felt threatened by. This was all for naught as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">New Warriors</a> interfered and won the freedom of Firestar, and she joined them instead.</li></ul><h2>The Hellions Were Formed</h2><p>This group of Hellions were together for years, and built a bond that only time could create. They would do battle with many of Marvel's heroes. Though they were created to battle and be enemies with the New Mutants. Through time it simply turned into something similar to a high school rivalry. The Hellions became more then a team, they were a family that most of them were deprived in their normal lives. Unfortunately, all this would be destroyed in one night.</p><p>As a means to lower tension between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, Emma threw a party and invited the X-Men (the Gold team led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>). Many of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle were being murdered and Emma felt that if they were targets that the X-Men wouldn't be too far from being the next targets. She wanted the teams to create an alliance, as she felt there was strength in numbers. Animosity between the two teams raged. Old rivalries, coupled with the immaturity of the Hellions egging the X-Men on led to a small skirmish that was quickly brought a halt when two (though at the time they could only see one, the other was using a cloaking device) unknown assailants broke in an attempted to assassinate the Emma. The female assassin immediately lunged at Emma. Emma far too quick, used a telepathic blast to take down her would-be attacker. While the teams regrouped and tried to question the girl/assassin, another attack began, though they had no clue from where. Even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey's</a> and Emma's vaunted telepathic gifts didn't register the second person. It was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, the one time partner of Emma, had returned but now he was there to kill Emma, not to help her. He was apart of the group of individuals called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/upstarts/65-9727/\">Upstarts</a> who were killing the members of the Inner Circle to gain points. The female attacker was sent in as a ploy to get the teams attention. Within the initial 20 seconds of his appearance he had already killed both Jetstream and Beef. Draining Jetstream of his life and throwing Beef out of the window of the skyscraper they were in, landing on the street, dead on impact. The combined forces of the X-Men and remaining Hellions eventually subdued Fitzroy, then another part of his plan unraveled. A huge teleportation gate opens with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">Donald Pierce</a>, also of the Hellfire Club, running through it with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a> following. The gate closes and a blood bath ensues. The Sentinels immediately head for Emma, apparently dealing her a killing strike. Empath tries to use his powers to see if she was alive, and runs when he finds that she was dead, or so he thought. The Sentinels decimate most of the Hellions and the X-Men barely get out with their lives. The remaining living Hellions, that didn't die in the fight, would have their life forces drained by Fitzroy, ultimately killing them, so he can open a temporal gate for his teammates to come through.</p><p>Those who were killed in the melee were: Jetstream, Beef, Bevatron, Roulette, Catseye and Tarot. As a side note, at the party there were approximately fifteen other Hellions that are shown but never given a name. It's assumed that Emma had recruited others but were not a part of the main team. They may not have had powers suited for battle, though this is never touched on. What is clear is that all the un-named Hellions would, too, have the life forces drained by Fitzroy. Though it seemed as if Emma was given a mortal blow, she actually did not die, but was put into a coma. When she awakens from her coma, she is informed of the death of her students. Grief-stricken and feeling completely responsible for their deaths, something changed in her. Unknown by all, Emma, over the years, grew to love and care for her students, her team of Hellions. The guilt over her loss would lead to her eventual reform. Tarot's story, too, was not over yet either. She is shown later in the page of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> alive. Tarot would be resurrected, due to her bond with King Bedlam. To be explained in New Hellions section. Other survivors (either because they were not apart of the team or left before the final battle) included: Thunderbird, Empath, Magma and Firestar (although not officially a member).</p><p>Additionally, it was noted in one of the Marvel Handbooks that a come of the New Mutants were members of the Hellions as well. A team of New Mutants were killed then resurrected by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beyonder/29-10300/\">Beyonder</a>. When they were brought to like they were mere husks of their former selves. They showed no emotion, being that their deaths affected their psyches greatly. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> was, at that time, the headmaster at Xavier Institute and also the White King of the Hellfire Club. He made the decision to send the affect students to Emma so that she could provide telepathic therapy to the students. While there, they were enrolled into the Massachusetts Academy and inducted as members of the Hellions, even participating in team training activities. This led to friendship being built between the team. They were: Cannonball, Douglas \"Doug\" Ramsey (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Cypher</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> (then Magik), Rahne Sinclair (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>), X'ian Coy Mahn (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>) and Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>).</p><p>Once cured of their ailments they quickly returned to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a> as it would be revealed that Magneto's decision to transfer his students was actually due to mental tampering from Empath. All would return save Magma who chose (or so she thought, later revealed to be manipulated by Empath's powers) to stay behind and remained with the Hellions.</p><h2>Original Team Stats</h2><p><b>Former Members:</b></p><p>Empath, Roulette, Thunderbird ll, Catseye, Tarot, Jetstream, Bevatron, Beef, Magma, Cannonball, Karma, Cypher, Wolfsbane &amp; Firestar (unofficial)</p><p><b>Base of Operations:</b></p><p>Massachusetts Academy</p><p><b>First Appearance:</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-new-mutants/49-3234/\">New Mutants</a> (vol.1) #16</p><h2>Emplate's Hellions</h2><p>The second group of \"Hellions\" was never truly an official incarnation of the Hellions.

This group consisted of some original members of the Hellions, some new ones and one that declined membership to the original group. The exploits of this team was limited to the few appearances that they made in X-Force. As a team their first and largest ploy was when they decided that they was to obtain and control a cryogenically frozen mutant known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/armageddon-man/29-15573/\">Armageddon Man</a>, a mutant of immense and immeasurable might. He was also was one of the earliest recorded mutants ever known. Once controlled they were to use him as a weapon against the government to blackmail them for a million dollars. Their team though would fall apart at the seams and have seen two of their force see the error of their ways and turn against their team. These two would aid X-Force and would see the tides turn That person being <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-bedlam/29-15576/\">King Bedlam</a>, who was also the one that organized and led the group. The New Hellions would swiftly be defeated and for the most part to be seen again in the Marvel Universe, neither as a team or singly. The team was organized by King Bedlam, he gathered together:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarot/29-2140/\">Tarot</a>: King Bedlam's girlfriend \"apparently\" resurrected. Similar but very different at the same time. Tarot has show mastery over her powers and improved usage of them as well. She is now able to take on the strengths of the tarot cards she wields. Such as assuming the death card she wears a black cloak and fights with a scythe (it never details if she could truly kill anyone with a touch of the scythe or if it simply acts as a weapon). This allows her to take a more active role in battle and makes her for effective physically.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>: The fiery Nova Roman would also resurfaced in the New Hellions, once a New Mutant, now apparently working for the bad side.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/feral/29-2160/\">Feral</a>: One time member of X-Force, her appearance is bitter sweet as she does battle with her ex-teammates.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradigm/29-15574/\">Paradigm</a>: A mutant techno-path infused with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/techno-organic/12-43631/\">Techno-Organic</a> matter extracted from the alien Phalanx.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/switch/29-15575/\">Switch</a>: A newcomer, with mutant mind swapping powers allowing him to mentally swap his mind with another allowing him to control their body.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jesse-bedlam/29-15329/\">Jesse Bedlam</a>: Jesse would briefly join his brother's team as well but quickly switches back to X-Force when he sees the error in his ways.</li></ul><h2>New Team Stats</h2><p><b>Former Members:</b></p><p>King Bedlam, Tarot, Magma, Feral, Switch, Paradigm &amp; Jesse Bedlam/Aaronson (King Bedlam's brother).</p><p><b>Base of Operations:</b></p><p>Mobile.</p><p><b>First appearance:</b></p><p>X-Force (vol. 1) #87</p><h2>the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\"><b>Xavier Institute</b></a>'s Hellions Squad</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76977\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76977-29469-hellions_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"76977\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76977-29469-hellions_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The last group to use the \"Hellions\" moniker thus far does so as a nod to the original team.

These squads would have one of the senior staffers assigned to them as an advisor, and each group would range from 5-6 mutants each. One such squad consisted initially with:</p><ul><li>Julian Keller (later assuming the codename <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a>): Squad leader and high level telekinetic.</li><li>Cessily Kincaid (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mercury/29-15078/\">Mercury</a>): Mutant with a malleable mercury form.</li><li>Santos Vaccarro (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide</a>): With super strength and composition of rock, he was the powerhouse of the team.</li><li>Sooraya Qadir (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dust/29-4555/\">Dust</a>): Able to transform into a living sandstorm.</li><li>Dallas Gibson (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/specter/29-41699/\">Specter</a>): Could merge with his shadow and take on a new super powered single form.</li><li>Josh \"Jay\" Gutherie (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Icarus</a>): Red winged younger brother of both Cannonball and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/husk/29-3426/\">Husk</a> with powers very similar to that of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>.</li><li>Brian Cruz (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tag/29-40539/\">Tag</a>): Limited psychic, able to compel and repel sentient beings.</li><li>Kevin Ford (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wither/29-40511/\">Wither</a>): A mutant with a decaying death touch.</li></ul><p>The Hellions Squad were a one of the prominent squads at the Xavier Institute and won the first Field Day competition.

A majority of the original team is still here including: Tarot, Roulette, Catseye, Jetstream, Beef and Bevatron.</p><p>After the fall of their High Lord Apocalypse, Magneto attempts to smooth over things with base-line humans and their governing council. The agreed upon solution was that Magneto and his X-Men were to apprehend all rogue followers of the, now dead, evil ruler, Apocalypse. The very first mission for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> and his X-Men is to capture the Hellions and bring them to the authorities to have them pay for the crimes they have committed.

As anyone might surmise from those four words, Simon Utrecht craved POWER and it wasn't enough that he had already acquired millions of dollars, being a serious industrial competitor of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> and having held political office, he wanted more! He wanted the might of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> and was willing to put his fortune on the line as well as his life and the lives of his three companions to obtain that power, sailing them right into the heart of a Cosmic Storm.</p><p>Tapping the knowledge of , Life-Support Specialist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vapor/29-6790/\">Ann Darnell</a> and her brother, Fuel Propulsion Engineer, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-ray/29-6822/\">Jimmy Darnell</a>, Utrecht goads Mike Steel into flying the ship. The Dynamic is now complete with four members ready to set sail to limitless power.</p><p>The sound of the rocket's propulsion wakens <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Bruce Banner</a> from his crater bed in the near by desert area, where he had been left by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> after reentering earths atmosphere. Deducing that the rocket configuration and trajectory could only mean space flight, Banner rushed to the mission control room to discover that the ship is headed straight for a cosmic storm, instruments reading radiation levels off the chart. Fearing for their safety Banner reprograms the flight control computer to bring them back before they are killed by radiation poisoning.</p><p>The occupants are bathed in the cosmic radiation, each of them experiencing something unique. Mike expresses that it feels as thought the weight of the ship were on his shoulders, his body somehow bonding with the ships alloy. Jimmy states that he feels aglow with power. Ann melds with the life support systems and Simon is overwhelmed by a mass of data somehow connected to the ships computers, as if he were vectoring towards the stars themselves. The Rocket returns crashing to earth with such a crushing explosion that Banner fears nothing could have survived the impact.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"555951\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555951-hulk254_09b_super.jpg\" title=\"U-Foes Emerge\"><img id=\"555951\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555951-hulk254_09b_medium.jpg\" alt=\"U-Foes Emerge\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">U-Foes Emerge</div></div></div></div><p>Much to Banner's surprise, four beings emerge from the wreckage with incredible powers.</p><p><b>Vector:</b> (Simon Utrecht) has the ability to vector/repel any object no matter it's weight size or density.</p><p><b>Vapor:</b> (Ann Darnell) Exhibits the ability to change her form into any gaseous mixture she imagines.</p><p><b>X-Ray:</b> (Jimmy Darnell) Commands radiation of all classifications and can project them offensively.</p><p><b>Ironclad:</b> (Mike Steel) Emerges with a metallic hide, the ability to control his density and Hulk class strength.</p><p>Immediately the quartet blame Banner for robbing them of even greater power by having brought them back too early. Banner is shocked by the revelation that they would expose themselves to dangerous levels of radiation intentionally, to which Simon Utrecht replies, \"You make it sound as if it were madness to seek after power! Perhaps it is when the quest ends in failure. But we have attained the power which we sought!\"</p><p>While pummeling Banner and continuing the blame game, Ironclad uses his cosmic irradiated logic to title the quartet the U-Foes. The <u><b>\"U\"</b></u> stands for Utrecht, who \"engineered the Voyage to the edge of Sanity!\" and <u><b>\"Foes\"</b></u> to signify the teams defiance of Humanity now that they are mighty and something greater than human.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"555952\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555952-namingconvention_super.jpg\" title=\"The Naming Convention!\"><img id=\"555952\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555952-namingconvention_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Naming Convention!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Naming Convention!</div></div></div></div><p>Incurring the wrath of the Hulk, the U-Foes battle clumsily as their powers are new to them and the team dynamic is something far less than \"dynamic\". Each member demonstrates a level of selfishness while trying to work as a team, catching Ironclad in friendly fire. While having the ability to defeat the giant green brute, ultimately the U-Foes end up defeating themselves as their increasing powers get the better of them, becoming uncontrollable. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vapor/29-6790/\">Vapor</a> unable to maintain her atomic structure dissipates into the air. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vector/29-6820/\">Vector</a> suffocates himself as he unwillingly pushes away even the smallest air molecule and pushes himself away from the earth into the outer atmosphere. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-ray/29-6822/\">X-Ray</a> is unable to control the radiation combination, explodes in the sky and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ironclad/29-6821/\">Ironclad</a>'s mass density get so heavy that he sinks into the ground working his way towards the earth's core.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The U-Foes were created by <a href=\"../../bill-mantlo/26-42478/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"../../sal-buscema/26-12717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sal Buscema</a> in 1980 and first appeared in <a href=\"../../the-incredible-hulk/49-2406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Incredible Hulk</a> # 254.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Of course this was not the end of the U-Foes. The team has tried to get revenge on the Hulk a multitude of times after their initial incarnation. They pop up every now and again with a second string treatment level but with first rate potential.</p><p>Much like the Fantastic Four, the team uses a family structure sharing the same goals and working together to reach their targets. Simon shares a romantic relationship with Ann much in the same way that Reed and Sue have but without the wedlock and the super powered offspring. Ann and Jimmy both come to each others aid in time of need like you would expect a loving siblings to do but this concern for one another is not specific to the siblings as all four members have dropped the cause of battle to aid one of their own in one instance or another.</p><p>Unlike the Marvel's first family, there is and air of negativity and dis-functionality that aids in their undoing, time and time again.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><p>The U-Foes fought the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\">West Coast Avengers</a> during the <a href=\"/acts-of-vengeance/39-41931/\">Acts of Vengeance</a>.</p><ul><li><h3>Civil War</h3></li></ul><p>The U-Foes registered as part of the Superhuman Registration Act after they were apprehended by the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a>.

Prof. Utrecht is a ruthless business man as well as being a Professor. Utrecht convinces three other people to join him in his quest to recreate Dr. Banners experiment. In the game Banner says he was tempted to go and speak to him when he first began working on the project. The army realizes what Utrecht is doing and sends a group of soldiers to arrest go an arrest him. Playing as the Hulk you must reach them and destroy them before they get to Utrecht because Banner needs to talk to him. A man named Rick Jones is an alley with you and radios you and tells you that there is a gamma radiation level coming from the top of Utrecht's apartment and if you don't destroy the dish then it could be a very bad thing for the city. Still playing as the Hulk you must rush to the apartment and destroy the satellite dish that is drawing the gamma energy. After doing so a small cut scene of the Hulk destroying the rest of the building shows and then the ufoes stand up and are amazed with the Hulk but decide he is a threat to them and he must be stopped. They will come at you by twos and try to kill you. They have all renamed themselves, Utrecht has named himself Vector. The others are named Vapor,Ironclad, and X-Ray. After finally defeating them a video will play of Vector promising that if the Hulk ever interferes again he must be killed. You will meet them randomly throughout the city later on.</p><p>In the 2012 turn based RPG social network game, Avengers Ultimate Alliance, the U-Foes are reoccurring enemies in chapter 4: You, Foe. Part 1 of chapter 4 has Ironclad and Vapor as bosses, Part 2 has X-Ray, part 3 has Vector, and Vapor is the last U-Foe to appear in the chapter in part 4, as a main boss, as the closing boss fight for chapter 4 part 5 features Doctor Doom as the boss rather the a member of the U-Foes.</p><h3>Television</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1537835\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1537835-animated_u_men_super.jpg\" title=\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\"><img id=\"1537835\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1537835-animated_u_men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</div></div></div></div><p>The U-Foes made their animated debut on <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/17-31304/\">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a>.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Rising out of the fall of the Axis Powers in World War II, HYDRA was created as a secret organization of global domination by Nazi spymaster <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/29-4662/\">Baron Wolfgang von Strucker</a> along with <a href=\"/kraken/29-60717/\">Kraken</a>. This developed with the help of an alliance with <a href=\"/shoji-soma/29-76602/\">Shoji Soma</a>, grandmaster of the <a href=\"/the-hand/65-1800/\">Hand</a>. When the power base pf HYDRA felt firmly established, Strucker installed himself as its supreme commander and ended the alliance with the Hand.</p><p>HYDRA recruited from the remnants of the Nazi's military forces and acquired alien technologies to advance its resources beyond what most governments possessed. Strucker chose to build HYDRA\"s forces quietly over the following decades.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hydra was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Through the decades, HYDRA was consistently used as a source of all-purpose terrorism and villainous cannon fodder with its legions of uniformed operatives and its philosophy \"cut off one head and two will takes its place.\" It also consistently served as an opposite number for <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, Marvel's source of all-purpose espionage and heroic cannon fodder.</p><p>A number of other criminal organizations began as branches of HYDRA before striking off as their own independent entities, such as <a href=\"/aim/65-13497/\">A.I.M.</a> and the <a href=\"/secret-empire/65-15136/\">Secret Empire</a>.</p><p>Baron Strucker has most commonly depicted as HYDRA's supreme leader. However, the organization fractured after his first death, leading to a variety of HYDRAs with a variety of leaders. This continued even after Strucker was resurrected and he supposedly reunited HYDRA. Other apparently supreme leaders of HYDRA included <a href=\"/viper/29-3420/\">Viper</a> and <a href=\"/gorgon/29-3777/\">the Gorgon</a>.</p><p>This was addressed in <a href=\"/secret-warriors/49-25640/\"><i>Secret Warriors</i></a> by <a href=\"/jonathan-hickman/26-45065/\">Jonathan Hickman</a>, who introduced the <a href=\"/hydra-high-council/65-58039/\">HYDRA High Council</a>. This embraced the sometimes inconsistent portrayals of HYDRA by rationalizing it as HYDRA now having a council-based leadership that including Strucker, Viper, Gorgon, <a href=\"/the-hive/29-60718/\">the Hive</a>, Kraken and a new <a href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegro-de-la-fontaine/29-23797/\">Madame Hydra</a>. The structure of HYDRA was much more strongly defined through the course of this series but also heavily changed in the end due to an internal civil war. Much of the High Council was left either dead or defected, leaving HYDRA under the command of Gorgon and Madame HYDRA.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/enemy-of-the-state/39-55965/\">Enemy of the State</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"265233\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine vs. Gorgon\"><img id=\"265233\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine vs. Gorgon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine vs. Gorgon</div></div></div></div><p>In an alliance between HYDRA and the Hand, Baron Von Strucker orchestrated a plan that saw <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> taken and killed by the Gorgon. Wolverine was then resurrected by the Hand's magic as a loyal agent of HYDRA. Wolverine was then sent on a killing spree in the superhuman and law enforcement communities in the service of HYDRA. Some of these superhumans were made into HYDRA agents using the same Hand magic that was used on Wolverine. Along the way, he also acquired defense secrets and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a>' technology for HYDRA. He was eventually brought down by a combined effort from the superhero community and freed of HYDRA's brainwashing. Despite this, HYDRA still accomplished a great deal.</p><p>All was not well within HYDRA, though. The Gorgon had entered into an affair with <a href=\"/elisbeth-von-strucker/29-4661/\">Elsbeth Strucker</a>, Baron Strucker's wife, and used this to overthrow h im as the Supreme Hydra. Both HYDRA and the Hand were now under his command, and he focused on the part of Strucker's plan involving using the Hand's magic to convert superhumans. He ordered a killing spree of superheroes and supervillains alike so that their bodies could be revived as loyal HYDRA agents, quickly gathering together a small army of them. .</p><p>However, S.H.I.E.L.D. had successfully deprogrammed Wolverine, and the mutant now wanted nothing but revenge. He tore through the Hand and Gorgon's former death cult, the Dawn of the White Light. He then came after Gorgon as he was carrying out a plan to assassinate Nick Fury. It was only Wolverine's last second intervention that prevented Gorgon from killing Fury, and Wolverine just barely managed to kill Gorgon, cutting off another head of HYDRA.</p><h3>The Seven Capital Cities of Heaven</h3><p>A man known simply as <a href=\"/xao/29-52979/\">Xao</a> formed an alliance with HYDRA in a plot to break through the mystical barrier separating Earth from <a href=\"/kun-lun/34-56104/\">K'un-Lun</a> and pillage the city of its ancient wonders. This plan failed when <a href=\"/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> managed to unite the <a href=\"/immortal-weapons/65-51583/\">Immortal Weapons</a> of all the other cities of Heaven against HYDRA's invasion force. The never made it through to K'un-Lun, and Xao was killed.</p><h3>Nick Fury: Agent of Nothing</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/nick-fury-agent-of-nothing/39-56029/\">Nick Fury: Agent of Nothing</a>, <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"818689\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34475/818689-copy__2__of_secret_warriors_4_8_super.jpg\" title=\"HYDRA High Council\"><img id=\"818689\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34475/818689-copy__2__of_secret_warriors_4_8_medium.jpg\" alt=\"HYDRA High Council\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">HYDRA High Council</div></div></div></div><p>When Nick Fury went rogue from S.H.I.E.L.D. and the government, it was discovered that for many years HYDRA had one of its tentacles into the highest levels of S.H.I.E.L.D., effectively meaning Fury had been working for HYDRA all this time. Ironically, HYDRA was dealing with its own infiltrators around the same time, namely the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a>. Upon realization that he had been breached by the Skrulls, Strucker chose to completely destroyed his undersea base codenamed Ichor with all of its personnel. He then reconvened HYDRA at Gehenna, their most treasured stronghold, and called the full HYDRA High Council together. They even forced the Grandmaster of the Hand to resurrect the Gorgon to convene the full council of HYDRA's leaders.</p><p>So it was that Baron Strucker, Kraken, the Hive, the Gorgon, Madame Hydra and the Viper all met together for what was apparently the first time, and Strucker laid out his intentions. Fury had discovered their true structure and was going to come for them. Rather than wait, he wanted HYDRA to go to war with Fury. Though some were reluctant, there was unanimous consent for Strucker's war.</p><h3>Wake the Beast</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/wake-the-beast/39-56433/\">Wake the Beast</a></p><p>HYDRA was betrayed by one of its leaders Madame Hydra, otherwise known as Contessa Allegro de la Fontaine. She was, in fact, a sleeper agent of <a href=\"/leviathan/65-57417/\">Leviathan</a>, an ancient enemy of HYDRA's dating back to the years of its very formation. She acquired from them an alien power source that could be used to awaken Leviathan's leader from stasis, and so rose <a href=\"/orion/29-70203/\">Orion</a>, leader of Leviathan. The two organizations met for what HYDRA hoped could be an understanding between them. Leviathan was not interested in any understanding, and so fierce war began between Leviathan and HYDRA.</p><p>All the while, Nick Fury and his small force of <a href=\"/secret-warriors/65-54569/\">Secret Warriors</a> manipulated events to urge them on.</p><h3>Wheels Within Wheels</h3><p>HYDRA took heavy losses in the war with Leviathan, and this was made worse when Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors successfully destroyed Gehenna. The loss of this stronghold fractured HYDRA's leadership, and two factions clashed in an internal civil war. One side rallied behind the Gorgon and the other behind Kraken. This only increased HYDRA's losses, and it turned out this was all carefully orchestrated by Nick Fury. Kraken was not the original man who helped create HYDRA but was actually Jake Fury. HYDRA had been played into killing itself, and Nick Fury personally executed Strucker.</p><p>Though diminished, HYDRA managed to endure because Fury had not accounted in his plans for Gorgon's resurrection. What remained of HYDRA gathered un his and Viper's leadership.</p><h2>Ultimate</h2><p>Spider-Man saved Tony Stark from an attack by HYDRA. Jameson recalls this events after Spidey's death.</p><h2>Exiles</h2><p>They are well underway with their plan to take over the world. This version is being led by Madame Hydra (Sue Storm) and her lover, Wolverine. Various other superhumans, including Captain America (now Captain Hydra), Iron Man and Slaymaster, are agents of HYDRA in this world. One of the Exiles' foe, the original character Venger later becomes an agent of HYDRA, as well as Boy-Bob Banner.</p><h2>MAX</h2><p>A terrorist organization that was involved in Cold War and battled against S.H.I.E.L.D. <a href=\"../../colonel-gagarin/29-14212/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colonel Gagarin</a> was a member.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h3><p>They seem more like a Men-In-Black team.</p><h3>Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/17-31304/\">Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1440698\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39997/1440698-hydrasoldiers_super.jpg\" title=\"Animated HYDRA\"><img id=\"1440698\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39997/1440698-hydrasoldiers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Animated HYDRA\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Animated HYDRA</div></div></div></div><p>In the continuity of this Disney XD animated series, HYDRA serves as a stand-in for the Nazi's in World War II and features prominently in Captain America's adventures in that era with Baron Heinrich Zemo and the Red Skull as its high-ranking commanders. HYDRA persists as a recurring threat through the first season in modern day as well under the command of Baron Von Strucker, though Viper is also present as Madame Hydra. <a href=\"/grim-reaper/29-7227/\">Grim Reaper</a> plays the role of one of HYDRA's foremost superhuman operatives, and <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> seemingly betrays S.H.I.E.L.D. to join them, secretly doing so as a double agent for Nick Fury.</p><p>HYDRA is ultimately defeated later in the first season when it goes with war with A.I.M. over possession of the Cosmic Cube. The Avengers intervene, leading to a battle between Captain America and Baron Strucker for the cube. They both touch it, seemingly having no affect. Both HYDRA and A.I.M. are then defeated and incarcerated.</p><p>HYDRA is the major villain in the rare video game titled <b>Spider-man: Web of Fire</b></p><p>In <b>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</b>, one of the levels includes an old HYDRA base that the Anti-Registration group was using. HYDRA's aerial base can be seen attacking the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the latter's stage in <b>Marvel Capcom 3</b> and the organization's logo can also be seen on the car that attempts to run She-Hulk down in one of her special moves.</p><h3>Ultimate Avengers 2</h3><p>Some HYDRA agents appear at the beginning fighting against Cap. After Cap defeats most of the agents, two of them try to escape in a van. Cap throws his shield, which slices clean through the van back-to-front, and causing it to skid out of control. The van crashes into a tank of some sort of chemicals, which then burst open, showering the van. The van melts along with both HYDRA agents.</p><h3>X-men: The Official Game</h3><p>HYDRA is partially responsible for the creation of the Master Mold and Sentinels alongside William Stryker. Under orders of their leader, Silver Samurai, HYDRA infiltrates Stryker's base to remove all evidence and Sentinel equipment, and by accident, activated the Master Mold. Lady Deathstrike was an agent of HYDRA too.</p><h3>Captain America: the First Avenger (2011)</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/captain-america-the-first-avenger/223-927/\">Captain America: the First Avenger</a></p><p>HYDRA is featured in this World War II era movie as a scientific research and development branch of the Third Reich. It is operated by the Red Skull and goes rogue from the German forces with its own advanced technology and weaponry. The organization is defeated after Captain America apparently kills Red Skull in battle, leading to their defeat by American forces. They appear in the movie's video game too.</p><h3>X-Men: Evolution</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/x-men-evolution/17-5435/\">X-Men: Evolution</a></p><p>In this X-Men animated series for Kids' WB, HYDRA appears briefly with seemingly Viper in command and as part of Wolverine's history.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>SHIELD was formed by (of course) <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury,</a> in the period after <a href=\"/world-war-ii/12-56025/\">World War II</a>. However, he figured the U.S government wouldn't want a group like that, so he disbanded it. Later, though, after a terrorist attack, he noticed that a group like SHIELD could really have helped and prevented the disaster. So he reformed it. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"/united-nations/65-57235/\">United Nations</a> had already taken SHIELD and restarted it, made it big. Fury immediately joined and rose to the top. The Nations had reformed it in response to a HYDRA attack, and once Fury was leading it, it flourished.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Shield made their first appearance in <a href=\"/strange-tales/49-18066/\">Strange Tales</a> #135. They were created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby.</a></p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>SHIELD (Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate) or Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law enforcement Division (see Iron Man #227) is a group affiliated with the U.N that deals with superhuman threats. It is an intelligence and anti-terrorism group similar to the FBI, only it is an international corporation that spans all the world. It acts like the police force. SHIELD agents are armed and work well, much more effective then standard police. They fight terrorists as well as super humans. SHIELD also has been responsible for the starting of spin-off groups like SWORD and S.T.R.I.K.E. S.H.I.E.L.D has agents that also are higher level, that often are super humans. Captain America, Spider-Woman, and Iron Man all have operated as SHIELD agents. SHIELD keeps ties to the superhuman community, too-they often call on the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and Captain America.</p><p>SHIELD has superhuman agents in the past-two teams were formed in an effort to make a SHIELD superhuman team. The first team consisted of Marvel Man, Texas Twister, the Vamp, and Blue Streak. However, it quickly failed, and another team in the same vein also failed. The Psi-Division of SHIELD is a group of psychics or telepathics that deal with psionic menaces. This is only one of the groups of super humans that work in SHIELD for the greater good.</p><p>All SHIELD members have a certain level, based on their importance. A normal SHIELD agent will have a Level One-which means he can pass through Level One areas and has clearance. A sergeant might have Level Two, which means he has Level Two and One clearance. The Director of SHIELD has a Level Nine clearance. Level Ten means the most important person in the world-no one currently possesses a Level Ten clearance. Not even the President, or Nick Fury.</p><p>SHIELD has many bases around the world. Many are on land-most notably SHIELD Central, which is located in New York City. There are also many shelters that are secretly placed around the world. Fury has used one, as has the Secret Avengers when they needed a base during the events of Civil War. However, their most famous and important base is the SHIELD Helicarrier.</p><h3>Helicarrier</h3><p>The Helicarrier is an aircraft that is constantly in the air. It is huge enough to hold an aircraft carrier. It is the mobile headquarters of SHIELD-and is extremely protected. The Helicarrier has held an entire squadron of jet fighters and a nuclear ballistic missile. There is one major Helicarrier, which is the one that is most important and used. There are also many smaller Helicarriers, however, which all serve as bases too. The Helicarrier has an extremely high level of security-even if someone managed to get on without clearance, guards and extremely powerful security technology would have them gone in a second. The Helicarrier was first proposed by Stark Industries, and was designed by Tony Stark, Forge, and Mr. Fantastic.</p><p>SHIELD operated as a covert, military/intelligence agency at the time, and members of it had already appeared. SHIELD already fought HYDRA then-the evil group had plots like the aforementioned \"Overkill Horn\". AIM made it's first appearance, and individual villains such as Red Skull also popped up and needed to be stopped by SHIELD. At this time, Godzilla came, and the Godzilla Squad was formed to take the monster down. SHIELD had tough periods during this time. Several lifelike robots got so smart that they became able to think and make choices-they became sentient beings. They had a grudge against SHIELD for making them follow orders all the time before they had intelligence-so they drugged important SHIELD members and took their place within the organization. Several of these were Contessa Valentina Allegro De Fontaine , Jimmy Woo , and Jasper Sitwell , among others. However, the valiant Fury managed to take them down.</p><h3>Fury's Influence</h3><p>Most of the reason that SHIELD was so effective started with Fury. He started the group and put good, effective agents in place. He was extremely popular in and out of SHIELD, and had strong ties with the hero community. Without him, many \"pessimists\" and intellectuals theorized that SHIELD would fall, and fall hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were right.</p><p>SHIELD ran into disastrous times. As aforementioned, Nick Fury did a mission in Latveria to stop them from attacking the U.S. However, it was totally unauthorized, and Fury was forced to resign from SHIELD Warrants went out for his arrest. The new head of SHIELD was Maria Hill-who proved to be incompetent at the position. The President of the U.S was a driving force behind Hill's election-for two reasons. Hill was a North American, and the President expected her to be loyal first and foremost to the U.S. Even though SHIELD was a United Nations facility. Also, many men and women had been members of SHIELD for a long time, and they would have been much better as the head of SHIELD. However, they were \"too loyal to Fury\", so Hill got the job to keep the Fury loyalists out.</p><p>SHIELD took a downward turn. Fury's work as the head of SHIELD was extremely effective, and an insane amount of work had kept corruption out of the huge organization. Unfortunately, Hill wasn't as good as Fury at it, and SHIELD became corrupt and weak. Crimes were committed. Criminals were \"stockpiled\" in prison. Worst of all, the Avengers discovered that someone was mining the anti-metal in the Savage Land using slave labor-and SHIELD was the prime suspect.</p><h3>Subdivisions</h3><p>SHIELD also has many subdivisions and other groups based off it. Two other groups have been formed from S.H.I.E.L.D- <a href=\"../../sword/65-41666/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.W.O.R.D</a>, and S.A.F.E.</p><p>SWORD stands for Sentient World Observation and Response Department. As you can easily guess, S.W.O.R.D works with extraterrestrials. It stops extraterrestrial threats, keeps tabs on powerful aliens, etc. They are not a subdivision of SHIELD, but are actually a separate, yet similar group that simply works with SHIELD. However, they are closely affiliated with both SHIELD and the United Nations. SWORD encountered Ord, an alien who was convinced that a mutant from Earth was destined to destroy his planet. He attempted to attack Earth to kill all the mutants-but SWORD and the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> stopped him, effectively stopping an interplanetary war. The leader of SWORD is <a href=\"../../abigail-brand/29-4441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abigail Brand</a>, a tough, effective leader who stopped many crises and is extremely valuable to SHIELD. She was a Fury loyalist and respected him a lot-but greatly dislikes Maria Hill. As for Tony Stark, he has not encountered SWORD or Brand yet. SWORD is currently trying to stop another war with a planet called Breakworld.</p><p>SHIELD is loyal to the United Nations-so two countries have created their own answer to SHIELD that works within their country and their country alone. The first to appear was the British version of SHIELD, S.T.R.I.K.E-which stood for Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies. S.T.R.I.K.E was British, but one of their early leaders, Tod Radcliffe, was revealed to be a traitor that worked for the Red Skull. The next leader was Lance Hunter. They worked closely with <a href=\"../../captain-britain/29-7477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Britain</a>. However, Vixen (Cap Britain's enemy) took them over and S.T.R.I.K.E was disbanded. The most prominent person to work for S.T.R.I.K.E was Betsy Braddock, who had psychic powers. After leaving S.T.R.I.K.E. she joined the X-Men as the heroine <a href=\"../../psylocke/29-3176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psylocke</a>.</p><p>S.A.F.E is the United States answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. The name stands for Strategic Action For Emergencies. S.A.F.E is nearly identical to S.H.I.E.L.D-except they are only in the U.S. They have fought many enemies, including Doctor Doom and <a href=\"../../baron-heinrich-zemo/29-3708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a>. The leader is Sean Morgan, a competent leader and good soldier. Joshua Ballard is the most prolific agent, and he's extremely helpful-he's the Dum Dum Dugan of S.A.F.E.</p><p>Along with these agencies, other small groups have been formed including Euromind and Starcore.</p><p>Another group that has continually showed up over the years is the Cape Killers. They were never an official SHIELD group, but SHIELD agents did make up it's ranks. The term Cape Killers was given to any group of soldiers trained to hunt, subdue and in worst case scenario kill meta humans. The Cape Killers have had such members as Agent Abrams, Agent Cleery, Dum Dum Dugan, &amp; Special Agent Marquez, and her partner Agent McAllister.</p><h3>Members</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"916245\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4_super.jpg\" title=\"Nick Fury\"><img id=\"916245\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Fury\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nick Fury</div></div></div></div><p>The most prominent, important, and effective member of SHIELD is the man who runs it all-Nick Fury. Fury was born in New York City in 1921, to decorated World War I pilot Jack Fury. He and his friend Red Hargrove lusted after adventure-so they joined the U.S Army in World War II. Nick was an adept soldier, and he was given command of the First Attack Squad-nicknamed the <a>Howling Commandos</a>. The Howling Commandos were extremely effective-and Fury quickly became a decorated war hero.</p><p>After the war, Fury was hit by a land mine and badly injured. The government decided to test a new formula on him-that would heal him and greatly retard his aging. This was called the <a>Infinity Formula</a>. It worked-Fury was restored to full strength and is still in his physical prime today. He eventually joined the CIA and became a CIA agent in Korea, also interacting with the Fantastic Four. Tony Stark hired him to be the second commander of SHIELD, and Fury excelled at the job. Under his leadership, SHIELD grew and grew until it is now one of the most powerful organizations in the world. Fury led SHIELD for over forty years, working tirelessly and keeping it powerful and secret.</p><p>However, Fury recently discovered that <a>Latveria</a>, led by the evil <a>Doctor Doom</a>, was planning to attack America. He immediately had SHIELD launch a covert assault on the country, effectively stopping the massive attack that would have taken place. A year later, Latveria attacked back, and thousands were killed. Fury was blamed-and <a>Luke Cage</a> was injured. Captain America was angered at Fury. Eventually, this culminated in Fury being fired as commander of SHIELD. A warrant was put out for his arrest, and <a>Maria Hill</a> took his place as the head of SHIELD. Hill still leads SHIELD, and Fury is still in hiding. He keeps control over parts of SHIELD and lent a base to the Secret Avengers during Civil War.</p><p>Nick Fury is infused with the Infinity Formula, meaning he barely ages at all. He is an soldier, with lots of experience as both a warrior and a leader. He is a master tactician and strategist, and is very good with all sorts of weapons. He wields great political power as the head of SHIELD, and is a very good hand-to-hand combatant.</p><p>Nick Fury is not the only SHIELD agent-not by a long shot. Many of the other important SHIELD members date back from Fury's old team-the Howling Commandos.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"141426\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan_super.jpg\" title=\"Dum Dum Dugan\"><img id=\"141426\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Dum Dum Dugan\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dum Dum Dugan</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> (Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader Dugan) was working as a circus strongman before he enlisted in World War II. He was put in the Howling Commandos, a new division led by Nick Fury. He was extremely valuable to the team-he was so strong that he was able to save them from many things that should have killed them. He was a great marksman, strongman, and leader, and he became Fury's second-in-command. When the war ended, Fury invited Dugan into SHIELD as his second-in-command. Dugan has easily been the second-most-important person to SHIELD. His missions have included tracking down and killing a radioactive monster ( <a>Godzilla</a>, in the Godzilla Squad) and various independent missions to take super villains (often with <a>Squirrel Girl</a>). For a long time, he worked maintaining security on the Helicarrier, and working for Fury whenever needed. When Fury was replaced by Maria Hill, he was her second-in-command and was put in charge of mutant affairs. This involved conflicts with <a>Wolverine</a>, who he had a mysterious contact with. Eventually, he tried to resign from SHIELD when Tony Stark took control. He was rejected-he was too important to SHIELD to quit. He was recently shot in the chest by Wolverine's son, but he survived, and is currently in the hospital.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"804114\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/804114-001_super.jpg\" title=\"Gabriel Jones\"><img id=\"804114\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/804114-001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Jones\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gabriel Jones</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../gabriel-jones/29-13836/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gabriel Jones</a> was a young African-American living in <a>New York City</a> when a little thing called World War II popped up.

After the war was over, Jones served on the Godzilla Squad with other former Howling Commandos (not Fury), and later joined SHIELD. He ran out missions with or without other agents for SHIELD until he retired, due to the events in the miniseries \"Nick Fury vs. SHIELD\". He remains retired today, living the quiet, peaceful life. He sure deserves that. He also has the honor of being the first African-American in the Howling Commandos.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"765560\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/765560-scpage_super.jpg\" title=\"Sharon Carter aka Agent 13\"><img id=\"765560\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/765560-scpage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Carter aka Agent 13\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sharon Carter aka Agent 13</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../sharon-carter/29-38227/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agent 13</a> (also known as <a>Sharon Carter</a>), is one of the most important members of SHIELD. As a young girl, Sharon loved hearing stories of her older sister Peggy, who was a World War 1 flying ace and freedom fighter. Peggy had worked with Captain America, and the two fell in love. However, Cap never learned her name, and he then froze in suspended animation. Sharon was a good fighter and loved justice, so she joined SHIELD under the codename \"Agent 13\" and ran out several missions for them. She kept crossing paths with Cap, who had been resurrected and they eventually fell in love. Cap wanted her to quit as a SHIELD agent, but she refused. Eventually, her death was faked so she could be sent off on a top-secret mission. The mission failed, and she was presumed dead. Cap was never informed that her death was faked the first time. However, he eventually found her, and she rejoined SHIELD. She now works as a high-level agent, reporting directly to Hill for missions. Recently, she was given a hypnotic suggestion by <a>Dr. Faustus</a> to help kill Steve Rogers, and under hypnotism, shot him in the stomach after <a>Crossbones</a>, a sniper and <a>Red Skull</a>'s henchman, shot him. It was also revealed that she is pregnant with Cap's baby.</p><p>Other important SHIELD agents include <a>Contessa Valentina Allegro De Fontaine</a>, <a>Clay Quartermain</a>, <a>Jimmy Woo</a>, and <a>Jasper Sitwell</a>.</p><h3>Hydra</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1487794\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71666/1487794-sw_21_0007_super.jpg\" title=\"Hydra\"><img id=\"1487794\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71666/1487794-sw_21_0007_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hydra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hydra</div></div></div></div><p>Since SHIELD is a major force and such a huge, powerful organization, it bound to have many enemies. Most of SHIELD's enemies are big groups-and the most powerful, fearsome, and deadly one of them all is <a href=\"../../hydra/65-3480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydra</a>. HYDRA is SHIELD's archenemy. The motto of the group is \"Cut off one of our heads, and two more will take it's place!\" This is a reference to the Ancient Greek monster called the hydra, which fought <a href=\"../../hercules/29-2503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hercules</a> and had the same ability. HYDRA is a terrorist group dedicated to taking over the world and destroying SHIELD, which has foiled them many a time.</p><p>HYDRA has actually been around for centuries. The group goes all the way back to Imperial Japan, which only sought to rule Japan. This all changed in the 1900s when Wolfgang Von Strucker joined the group. Strucker was insane, deluded, and powerful-and he quickly rose to the top of the group. he steered it away from Japan and decided on a new goal-rule the world!When he got to the top, he changed his name and got a title-he became <a href=\"../../baron-strucker/29-4662/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Strucker</a>. HYDRA was originally very open, not quiet, and SHIELD was actually specifically formed to fight it (as you will read later). HYDRA and SHIELD became enemies-constantly warring to take each other down. HYDRA made several daring moves. Strucker invented the \"Overkill Horn\", which would detonate all nuclear explosives worldwide. Later came the biological \"Death-Spore Bomb\". Both plots were foiled by SHIELD, and the latter resulted in Strucker's death.</p><p>After Baron Strucker died, HYDRA split into many mini-groups, or \"heads\" of HYDRA. Some of these were East Coast HYDRA, Las Vegas HYDRA, New York HYDRA, and Germany HYDRA. These factions also genetically created super agents for HYDRA, resulting in the creation of many villains. However, this backfired when the great hero Spider-Woman was created by HYDRA related. Eventually Strucker was revived, and he reunited HYDRA. They continued their war against SHIELD and the Earth.</p><p>HYDRA later planned a massive attack on the U.S-they smuggled nuclear missile into America and was going to launch a bio nuclear assault on a major aquifer. They also tried to brainwash an army of heroes and villains (including <a href=\"../../elektra/29-1802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a>). Both times, they were foiled by SHIELD and the <a href=\"../../new-avengers/65-42520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Avengers</a> (including Spider-Woman, who they created). HYDRA is still extremely dangerous, and cannot be stopped easily. The only reason they don't currently rule the world is because of the heroic efforts of SHIELD.</p><p>The HYDRA Agent is similar to the SHIELD agent. He is extremely well-trained-only the elite become agents. They carry a large variety of weapons and are trained especially in stealth. HYDRA Agents often get missions to detonate, destroy, beat up, or burn things, and they are superb fighters. Some Agents of HYDRA have been Red Skull, <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a>, and many others.</p><h3>AIM</h3><p>Although HYDRA is easily SHIELD's greatest enemy, it is by no means the only one. One of SHIELD's worst enemies is <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.I.M</a>.</p><p>A.I.M (Advanced Idea Mechanics) was created as a subdivision of HYDRA, by Baron Strucker. AIM's purpose was to create new technological wonders for HYDRA to use against SHIELD and to take over the world. It is a group of scientists, industrialists, and technological geniuses, and originally, they provided and designed weapons, defenses, and huge assault mechanisms for HYDRA. However, HYDRA suffered a huge defeat from the U.S and Japan Armies, so AIM broke off into it's own group. Like HYDRA, AIM's goal is to rule the Earth. However, unlike HYDRA, who wants to do it by force, AIM seeks domination by technological means. They have created huge weapons and marvels before, and share one trait with HYDRA-they are dedicated to destroying SHIELD. AIM was led by the Scientist Supreme, an evil, shadowy figure where very little about him is known by S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>The <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Cube</a> was an intensely powerful item-it could literally alter reality to the user's whim. Red Skull once stole it and wreaked havoc with it, but that was later. The Cube was created by the scientists at AIM, who sought to use it to rule the world. However, the Cube actually evolved into a new creature, <a href=\"../../kubik/29-20022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kubik</a>, and AIM no longer controls it. In this vein, AIM created the <a href=\"../../super-adaptoid/29-10861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Adaptoid</a>, which could exactly mimic the powers and appearance of other superheroes and villains. Although it was immensely powerful, the Adaptoid contained a sliver of the Cosmic Cube that gave it its power. When the Cube became Kubik, it wanted the shard back, so it easily destroyed the creature and regained the sliver. AIM also created <a href=\"../../modok/29-3709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MODOK</a> (Mobile Organism Designed Only for Killing). MODOK was originally one of AIM's own scientists, and he took control of AIM and improved it, continuing the fight to rule the world and destroy SHIELD. MODOK still is in charge of AIM.</p><p>Along with A.I.M, some of SHIELD's enemies are <a href=\"../../zodiac/65-41170/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zodiac</a> and Godzilla.</p><p>Zodiac is a criminal organization that was created using SHIELD technology. Each member is another sign of the Zodiac, and they are dedicated to world domination. Although the Zodiac mostly fights the Avengers, they often collide with SHIELD in their efforts to have the world ruled by their criminal organization.</p><p>Godzilla was a radioactive monster that rose out of the waters of Tokyo, Japan. SHIELD immediately responded to the crisis, and formed the Godzilla Squad out of some of its members. The Squad was led by Dum Dum Dugan (who never fully recovered from the experience), and its mission was to take down Godzilla! Godzilla caused lots of property damage around Asia and North America before it was finally driven back into the sea. Obviously, this is based on the Japanese movie in real life of the same name-minus the SHIELD agents.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Civil War</h3><p>The Civil War started when the <a>New Warriors</a> (consisting of <a>Robbie Baldwin</a>, <a>Namorita</a>, <a>Microbe</a>, and <a>Night Thrasher</a>) went on a basic mission to catch four criminals in an old house. They included <a>Speedfreek</a> and an old <a>Captain Marvel</a> villain- <a>Nitro</a>. These villains had escaped from the Raft when <a>Electro</a> broke them out. The New Warriors easily defeated the villains-but Nitro was escaping. Namorita stopped him, but he let off an explosion, destroying Stamford and murdering 600 people.</p><p>Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, proposed the Superhuman Registration Act, where all super humans would have to register their powers and identities. They'd basically be cops. Maria Hill, who was the head of SHIELD, supported the Act, and eventually it was passed. Many super humans disagreed with the Act, the most important and prolific being Captain America. SHIELD was enlisted by the U.S government-take down Cap and his anti-registration hero team, the <a>Secret Avengers</a>. New SHIELD Agents, nicknamed cape-killers, went after anti-reg heroes. SHIELD was led by Maria Hill, and was fully pro-reg. Iron Man worked closely with SHIELD also-he revealed his identity as Tony Stark. Many battles were fought. Eventually, Tony Stark's pro-registration side-and SHIELD-won. However, Maria Hill found out why she had been made the head of SHIELD, as aforementioned-to keep more effective \"Fury loyalists\" out and be loyal to the U.S. She was not supposed to be effective, and she wasn't. Dismayed, she turned leadership of SHIELD over to the man she thought deserved it most-Tony Stark. Stark, also Iron Man, is currently the leader and head of SHIELD</p><h3>HAMMER</h3><p>In the fallout of Secret Invasion Norman Osborn is granted the keys to the whole world and closes down SHIELD and replaces it with his own special forces known as HAMMER.</p><p>Nick fury also discovers a dark secret about who as been pulling SHIELD's strings the whole time he was an agent in Secret Warriors #1.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>SHIELD has a lot of technology, important technology that is often used. Perhaps the most important is the LMD- <a href=\"../../life-model-decoy/18-42286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Life Model Decoy</a>. The Life Model Decoy is an android that is absolutely indistinguishable from whoever it impersonates. Fingerprints, DNA, hair, speech, thought patterns (for telepaths), anything, the Decoy is exactly the same. However, it is an android. LMDs are used to duplicate people and take their place if they are going to be assassinated or there is a strong chance of an attack. LMDs have been used in place of personnel since the beginning of the organization, including Jessica Drew. Most often, they have been used as a substitute for Nick Fury, who has had at least five LMDs destroyed in attempts to have him killed. These robots are a lot of the reason that many key SHIELD members are still alive. The Zodiac, a criminal organization, was created using stolen SHIELD LMDs. Also, LMDs have gained sentience a few times. The Deltites were a group of LMDs that gained sentience and tried to infiltrate SHIELD. They were narrowly defeated by Nick Fury.</p><p>SHIELD also has used robot exoskeletons and gargantuan robots to achieve its ends. <a href=\"../../red-ronin/29-33761/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Ronin</a> is the most important of those. Red Ronin was a huge, super powerful robot that was used by the Godzilla Squad. The robot was destroyed by Godzilla before he was driven into the sea. It was rebuilt, but was hijacked by a mad scientist who was trying to start World War Three. It was stopped by the Avengers and SHIELD regained the remains. It has been stolen and used for evil many times, by Dr. Doom, <a href=\"../../the-hand/65-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hand</a>, and <a href=\"../../henry-gyrich/29-9711/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry Gyrich</a>. Each time, the robot has been defeated and rebuilt (by heroes like <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wasp</a> and Hulk)-only to be stolen again. Red Ronin is currently possessed and used by the evil villain The Fixer-it appears that the cycle is still going.</p><p>Of course, the most prolific technology created and used by SHIELD is the Helicarrier. The Helicarrier is outfitted with weapons, security, and is constantly filled with SHIELD agents who are extremely effective and good fighters. The Helicarrier is always being attacked by villains, and they are barely ever successful. Read more about the Helicarrier at the top of the page. A smaller version of the Helicarrier, the Behemoth, is often used by SHIELD Agents on missions, including by the Squad and by Dum Dum Dugan. The Behemoth is similar to the Helicarrier, only there is less weapons, technology, and it isn't as fast or powerful.</p><p>As for other technology, SHIELD has access to an infinite amount of military-level tech. Tools, weapons, anything that's used, SHIELD can get. Anything from pistols to nuclear weapons is easily attainable. Fighter jets are often used by SHIELD agents when it is necessary for their mission.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</h3><p>In the Ultimate Marvel universe, S.H.I.E.L.D was started and first led by <a href=\"../../general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Thunderbolt Ross</a>, who is a major enemy of the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>. SHIELD funded and sanctioned projects like <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-5018/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a>, which created Wolverine. A now-black Nick Fury took control of the group and was very effective. He tried to recreate the Super Soldier program, making another Captain America. the project failed and the formula turned the lead scientist on the project, Bruce Banner, into the Hulk. SHIELD tried again with the Oz formula. It was responsible for the creation of <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"../../green-goblin/29-1484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Goblin</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sandman</a>, and Electro.</p><p>Also, Ultimate SHIELD created the <a href=\"../../ultimates/65-40504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimates</a>, as the government enlisted Fury to create a strike force of government-sponsored superheroes. The force was similar to the Avengers in the 616 universe, and answers to Ultimate SHIELD.</p><h3>Marvel Zombiverse (Earth-2149)</h3><p>SHIELD also appears in Marvel Zombies Universe. At first, some of the members are already infected by the virus when Sentry came to Earth infected. The first of the members infected were Colonel America, <a href=\"../../ms-marvel/29-21561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=\"../../hawkeye/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hawkeye</a>, and <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a>. Luke Cage is part of the Avengers. After these infections, it starts to go on from there, with the infected heroes infecting other heroes and villains while eating people completely. <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> becomes infected by Spider-Man after saving <a href=\"../../nova/29-2105/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nova</a> and Nova is saved by the Fantastic Four and Thor and goes to the SHIELD Helicarrier. SHIELD has called all uninfected heroes to meet together with Nick Fury and Nick Fury tells the uninfected heroes that they must make a defensive stand against the infected. The heroes agree to this, SHIELD, Avengers, and many more alike, and they go fight the zombies. However, this ends in tragedy and the uninfected become infected by the virus. The heroes were no match for the zombies and they all subdue to infection, becoming one of them. SHIELD becomes no more and all of the members are killed or infected.</p><h3>Mutant X (Earth-1298)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"661527\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super_super.jpg\" title=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\"><img id=\"661527\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, SHIELD now stands for Save Humanity by Intervention in the Evolution of Life-form Deviants.

After much planning, expense and hard work; the ship was built and was nearing its launch date. However, as the launch neared, the federal government was about to cut funding for the flight. Reed decided there was no choice but to launch the ship before the whole effort was scrapped and wasted.</p><p>Reed invited his girlfriend Susan Storm along for the trip and her brother Johnny Storm insisted on coming along in order to keep her safe. Wanting a pilot with both the ability and the guts to make the flight, Reed turned to his former college roommate and very close friend Ben Grimm, a highy accomplished former test pilot for the United States Air Force. The crew now set, everyone was ready for launch when Reed received a warning from the authorities concerning the effects of the cosmic rays on human bodies so far out in space. Reed's request for launch was denied and the mission aborted.</p><p>More desperate than ever to make the flight, Reed's crew waited until the changing of the guards that night and then sneaked onto the ship and launched before any planes could be scrambled to intercept them and/or shoot them down using missiles. Successful in leaving the Earth's atmosphere, they were halfway along on their mission when they entered a sub-space storm and were bombarded by intense cosmic rays both before they expected and stronger than they expected. This unexpectedly intense cosmic ray storm had strange and disorienting effects on the crew, making them unable to continue the trip. They turned back, returned to Earth and crash-landed in a small opening in a forested area.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1248591\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o_super.jpg\" title=\"The Birth of the Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1248591\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1248591-2163445905_4a784aae01_o_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Birth of the Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Birth of the Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>Luckily, they survived the crash but were radically changed. Ben felt his body become heavy and found he'd turned into a monster. Reed tried to calm him down and restrain him when he realized that he'd reflexively stretched and wrapped his body around Ben; he now had elastic stretching abilities. Johnny burst into flames while Sue panicked and turned invisible. Gathering their wits, they soon managed to calm themselves and agreed to use their new-found powers for the good of humanity and stay together as a team. Johnny called himself the \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a>,\" Sue took the name \"Invisible Girl\" (and later changed it to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>). Ben chose the name \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing\"</a> and Reed decided to call himself \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>.\" Thus, the Fantastic Four were born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Fantastic Four was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/49-2045/\">Fantastic Four</a> #1, November 1961. Stan Lee and Jack Kirby created the Fantastic Four after seeing what a success <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics'</a> <a href=\"/justice-league/65-55928/\">Justice League</a> was. While this is no doubt true, it has also been rumored for years that Stan actually patterned the FF team after DC's Sea Devils team and The Challengers of the unknown. Looking at the composition of both teams, there are a lot of similarities, so this rumor could well be correct.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Silver Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1189434\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189434-ff_vs_mm_super.jpg\" title=\"Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\"><img id=\"1189434\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189434-ff_vs_mm_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fantastic Four v.s Mole Man</div></div></div></div><p>The first family super team of Marvel Comics, the <b>Fantastic Four</b> opened up the genre to a whole new way of telling the old story of family binds above all else. The Fantastic Four as a team made their public debut when a villain named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mole-man/29-2481/\">Mole Man</a> (A villain that lives underground) began attacking the surface. The Fantastic Four continued their illustrious careers as superheroes and unlike <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, they were well loved by the public and the media by appearing on television and more.</p><p>Reed Richards also created the \u201c <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/unstable-molecules/18-54225/\">unstable molecules</a>\u201d which are used for their costumes. This allows Reed\u2019s costume to stretch as he does, Invisible Girl\u2019s goes invisible when she does, and Human Torch\u2019s doesn\u2019t burn up when he flames on. Reed would also discover <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">The Negative Zone</a> ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> shared credit for the creation of the Negative Zone and unstable molecules). The Negative Zone is a parallel universe in which all matter is negatively charged. It also has a breathable atmosphere which allows Mr. Fantastic to lead his team in adventures in the Negative Zone. The Negative Zone is mostly uninhabited and Reed was eventually able to map out most of the area.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216479\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216479-ff_38___a.jpg\" title=\"FF 38 (1965) - captive Sue laying next to the Q-bomb\"><img id=\"2216479\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216479-ff_38___a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 38 (1965) - captive Sue laying next to the Q-bomb\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 38 (1965) - captive Sue laying next to the Q-bomb</div></div></div></div><p>One of the most important issues of the Silver Age was FF 38, \"Defeated by the Frightful Four\". This is the first issue where the FF are actually defeated by the end of the story. Medusa shows superb cunning by creating a trap for the Invisible Girl. She lures Sue to an East Side fashion house, on the pretext of showing her some wedding dresses. When Sue arrives, Medusa captures her easily with her deadly red hair and the Trapster makes certain the blonde girl cannot escape by shooting her with his paste gun. The Wizard flies himself, Sue and his two partners up into the air. The Frightful Four take an unconscious Invisible Girl to an isolated Pacific island and then go into an underground chamber. Wizard directs Trapster to place the girl down next to the detonation mechanism of a powerful nuclear Q-bomb! The Fantastic Four follow in an attempt to rescue Sue. However, after a brief battle, the Frightful Four escape, leaving the FF on the island. Fortunately Sue's partners find her just in time and Reed gets Sue to use her force field. The bomb explodes. While the FF survive, they have lost their powers. Daredevil then assists them in FF 39-40, as the FF try and avoid death at the hands of Doctor Doom. They do not regain their powers until late in issue 40.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216525\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216525-ff___annual_6.jpg\" title=\"FF Annual 6 - The birth of Franklin Richards\"><img id=\"2216525\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216525-ff___annual_6_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF Annual 6 - The birth of Franklin Richards\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF Annual 6 - The birth of Franklin Richards</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1174781\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b_super.jpg\" title=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\"><img id=\"1174781\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1174781-panel_ffann003b_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF Annual 3 - Sue &amp; Reed are married\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF Annual 3 - Sue & Reed are married</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216455\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216455-ff_81___crystal.jpg\" title=\"FF 81 - Crystal replaces Sue and then she saves the FF from the Wizard\"><img id=\"2216455\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216455-ff_81___crystal_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 81 - Crystal replaces Sue and then she saves the FF from the Wizard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 81 - Crystal replaces Sue and then she saves the FF from the Wizard</div></div></div></div><p>Reed and Sue eventually married in 1965 and it became a celebrity event. The couple continued their newly married life in the public eye for years to come. Later Sue would become pregnant with a baby boy whom would be named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>. Due to Sue being pregnant, she had to take a temporary leave on the team. To take Sue's place, the Fantastic Four decided to recruit the Human Torch\u2019s girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a>. However due to the pollution on Earth, Crystal was forced to leave the Fantastic Four soon after. Sue eventually gave birth to Franklin on 1968 in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four-annual/49-2129/\">Fantastic Four Annual</a> #6, and returned as an active member on the Fantastic Four. Lee and Kirby ended their run when Kirby left Marvel in 1970.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216460\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216460-ff130_breakup.jpg\" title=\"FF 130 - Sue and Reed separate\"><img id=\"2216460\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216460-ff130_breakup_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 130 - Sue and Reed separate\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 130 - Sue and Reed separate</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2221330\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue.jpg\" title=\"Medusa tells Reed she will replace his estranged wife\"><img id=\"2221330\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221330-medusa_repalces_sue_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Medusa tells Reed she will replace his estranged wife\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Medusa tells Reed she will replace his estranged wife</div></div></div></div><p>Sue and Richards\u2019 relationship eventually became dysfunctional because Sue began hating the life of a celebrity. Feeling angry she was not treated as an equal, Sue left the Fantastic Four at the end of Fantastic Four 130 and the Inhuman named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a> would fill in for Sue while she took a break. Sue eventually returned to active duty in the Fantastic Four again, but only after Namor staged a fight with Mr. Fantastic in issue #149. Sue did not return to active FF duty for several more issues after the reconciliation. The separation between Sue and Reed lasted for 19 issues. This is really significant, as it means the separation lasted for one year and 7 months. This was a very harsh break-up that could easily have ended in Sue and Reed getting a divorce. The fans seemed to side with Mr. Fantastic in the break-up and against the Invisible Girl. The Fantastic Four Fan Page in issue #152 actually had a shocking letter which urged the writers to kill Sue off and the FF Bullpen implied that a few other fans had also urged them to kill Sue, though not as many as had called for Sue and Reed to divorce. The Fan Page editorial staff went on to say that the consensus was that they had to find a way to make Sue think again, implying that perhaps the gorgeous blonde had not been thinking straight when she left Reed and the team. Medusa did perform in a satisfactory manner in Sue's absence, though she did not demonstrate the awesome power that Crystal did, when Crystal replaced Sue a few years earlier, due to Sue's maternity leave with baby Franklin Richards.</p><p>During the 1970s the Fantastic Four had many artists and writers who would continue the Fantastic Four\u2019s public career as superheroes. A roster change would come up when the Thing temporarily lost his powers. Reed decided to hire mercenary Power Man ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>) to fill in for Ben.</p><p>Reed eventually finished developing an exoskeleton that mimics his strength as the Thing, and Ben returns to the Fantastic Four as an active member. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-byrne/26-1770/\">John Byrne</a> would take over the Fantastic Four in the 1980s where critics would call \u201cthe best</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1189423\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189423-102_spider_man___the_secret_wars_1_super.jpg\" title=\"The Secret Wars\"><img id=\"1189423\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1189423-102_spider_man___the_secret_wars_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Secret Wars\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Secret Wars</div></div></div></div><p>run since Lee and Kirby.\u201d Byrne was most celebrated for his modernization of Invisible Girl.

During their time in the Secret Wars, the Thing was able to change to his human form and the Thing form at will. After the heroes were victorious against the Beyonder, the Thing decided to stay on the alien planet as he was happy to be able to change his forms at will. When the Fantastic Four returned to Earth, they recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> to fill-in for the Thing.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1228622\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1228622-fantasticfour_v1_279_p12_super.jpg\" title=\"She-Hulk replaces Thing spot in the Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1228622\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1228622-fantasticfour_v1_279_p12_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"She-Hulk replaces Thing spot in the Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">She-Hulk replaces Thing spot in the Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>Later, Sue would appear to have become pregnant with a second child but instead, Sue suffered a miscarriage.

Sue turns out to be a mutant Skrull named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/delila/29-56198/\">De'Lila</a> who is a leader of a band renegades searching a technotroid egg to use as a weapon against the Skrull Empire.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1331664\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1331664-art_adams_and_walt_simonson__the_fantastic_four__page__042_super.jpg\" title=\"The New Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1331664\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1331664-art_adams_and_walt_simonson__the_fantastic_four__page__042_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The New Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The New Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>Later, Marvel editor-in-chief <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tom-defalco/26-41037/\">Tom DeFalco</a> decided to retcon Johnny and Alicia\u2019s relationship. They revealed that the real Alicia was actually kidnapped by the Skrull Empire and was replaced by a shape-shifting Skrull named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lyja/29-11892/\">Lyja</a>. When they discovered this, Lyja had fallen in love with Johnny and decided to help the Fantastic Four rescue the real Alicia.</p><p>After Ben and Alicia were able to reconcile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sharon-ventura/29-20604/\">She-Thing</a> (Sharon Ventura) had already fallen in love with Ben and decided to ally with Dr. Doom afterwards. However, Dr. Doom mutated her even more and she eventually left for good. Franklin Richards was later kidnapped by a time-traveler named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nathaniel-richards/29-7221/\">Nathaniel Richards</a> (Father of Reed Richards) and took him to the future to raise him there. He brought Franklin back as a teenager, who dubbed himself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Psi-Lord</a>.</p><p>It was later revealed that in a future time-line, Franklin would father a child with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a> who would become a super villain named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hyperstorm/29-11832/\">Hyperstorm</a>. For a time, it had appeared that Mr. Fantastic was killed by Dr. Doom, who also was badly wounded and dying. However, it was later revealed that Mr. Fantastic and Dr. Doom were not dead, but were kidnapped by Hyperstorm right before their deaths. The Fantastic Four eventually discovered this and were able to free Reed and defeat Hyperstorm with the help of Galactus.</p><p>When the team returned back to Earth, Nathaniel decided to revert Franklin back to his original age as a child. The Fantastic Four would later battle the psychic being known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a>. Onslaught was too powerful for the Fantastic Four and all the heroes of Earth, it became a losing battle. However, the heroes devised a plan to defeat Onslaught but at the cost of all non-mutant hero lives. The Fantastic Four and all the heroes decided to sacrifice themselves in order to destroy Onslaught and were seemingly killed in the process.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"232407\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught_super.jpg\" title=\"Heroes vs. Onslaught\"><img id=\"232407\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/232407-146823-onslaught_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes vs. Onslaught\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heroes vs. Onslaught</div></div></div></div><p>Since Reed had developed so many advanced technologies, the Government attempted to seize all his equipment, however Nathaniel traveled back to this reality and stored all of Reed\u2019s equipment into the Negative Zone. However, with Franklin\u2019s reality-altering powers he was able to store all the sacrificed heroes in a pocket universe and was able to bring them back to life on this reality\u2019s Earth. The team would later return from the Heroes Reborn Earth, and have to cope with the fact that they had been considered dead for more than a year.</p><p>During this time the team resided in Pier 4, since <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/four-freedoms-plaza/34-42378/\">Four Freedoms Plaza</a> now belonged to a group of super villains, masquerading as heroes known as, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a>. It was also around this time when the team came in contact with a teenage girl calling herself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valeria-von-doom/29-18247/\">Valeria von Doom</a>, who claimed to be the daughter of Susan and Doom in the future. Sue was apprehensive at first with the girls story but eventually she and the rest of the team came to accept Valeria as both ally and friend.</p><p>In a struggle against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abraxas/29-18246/\">Abraxas</a>, Valeria forfeited her life in order to help bring back Galactus to life. But she would not die. She is transformed into the form of a fetus and transferred into Sue's womb, making Valeria's story true except for one notable difference. She had been Reed's daughter all along. Sue was pregnant again but all would not go well for the Invisible Woman. Due to Sue's cosmic radiation exposure it became difficult to give birth. With Reed away solving a world crisis, Johnny turns to Dr. Doom and asks him to help his sister. Doom was successful in the delivery but forced Sue to allow Doom to name the child. Doom would name her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valeria-richards/29-2470/\">Valeria Richards</a> after a woman that he had once loved.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192171\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192171-waid_super.jpg\" title=\"Mark Waid-Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1192171\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192171-waid_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Waid-Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mark Waid-Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mark-waid/26-40724/\">Mark Waid</a> era saw the Fantastic Four we see a lot of new concepts and amazing arcs come to light. His first stories on the book dealt with the Fantastic Four as Imaginauts and how they dealt with the fame that they always had their way. We also saw glimpses of Johnny as a much more responsible man, thanks to his sisters conjecture.</p><p>We also witness Doom's ruthlessness in trying cause harm to the Fantastic Four at any costs. He sold his loves life, Valeria (his first love) in an attempt to gain more of the magics that were always in his blood and which he denounced for a life of science. Seeing now that having both would help him in his end, he betrayed her to demons and was able to get the magical knowledge he yearned for.</p><p>To add to that, when Doom delivered baby Valeria, he cast a spell on her that would make her his magical familiar and he used the connection to carry out a devastating attack against the team. In the instant she uttered \"Doom\" demons kidnapped Franklin and Reed and Johnny tried desperately to save him before Johnny was burnt badly by demon fire. Sue and Ben hurry to Reed to tell him what's happened when they discovered Johnny wailing and notice his burnt flesh. They explain what happened and the team sets out to rescue Franklin and heal Valeria from this affliction Doom gave upon her.</p><p>They travel to Latveria where the team is ambushed by Doom. He takes Valeria and uses his magic in order to have the team suffer through painful versions of each others powers. He gives Johnny, Reed's stretching abilities, stretching him to his limits. He gives Sue a painful version of her brother's flame power. He has Ben fight off dozens of monsters. And finally he sticks Reed in a room full of magical information. But with the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, (or should I say his astral projection), Reed escapes and saves his family. Together they defeat Doom, and rescue Franklin and Valeria. Doom was vanquished and left in Hell by Reed, but not before Doom instilled a parting gift on him and scarred his face. This encounter would have lasting affects on the team and Reed.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, the super-hero community was split in two, one in favor of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human registration act</a> and the other against it. Reed sided with the Pro-Registration side along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> as team leader against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America's</a> Anti-Registration team.</p><p>A group of civilians attacked Johnny and seriously injured him because they blamed the super-heroes for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stamford-ct/34-45571/\">Stamford</a> Incident. Susan and Thing reluctantly joined Reed's side all the while looking over a hospitalized Johnny, who was seemingly neglected by Reed. Reed, Sue and Ben joined the first battle against Captain America's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> where a Cyborg <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, made by Iron Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> and Reed, joined the battle and killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a>. After witnessing this, Sue shielded Cap's team from Thor's attack, giving them the time they needed to teleport away. Although Reed tried to explain himself, Sue refused to hear any of it. She decided to turn her back on Reed, and along with Johnny, who was released from the hospital, she joined the Secret Avengers and left a note for Reed explaining her actions and begging him to spend time with the children, who were neglected by Reed since the start of this struggle. However, Ben refused to participate in this war any longer, and although he did not agree with the Registration Act, he refused to fight the Government so he left for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/france/34-55778/\">France</a>. Reed remained with Iron Man and even helped built a prison in the Negative Zone meant for the rogue heroes.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1363219\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm_super.jpg\" title=\"Reed dies saving Sue in the Civil War\"><img id=\"1363219\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1363219-8_30_2010_6_40_22_pm_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Reed dies saving Sue in the Civil War\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Reed dies saving Sue in the Civil War</div></div></div></div><p>In the final battle between the two sides, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/taskmaster/29-4578/\">Taskmaster</a> shot at Sue but Reed intervened and took the bullet instead, wounding him. This angers Sue and she smashes Taskmaster down with an invisible construct. Johnny was seen attempting to ambush Iron Man from behind but failed, During the fight, Ben returned and tried to save as many people as possible from being caught in the crossfire. When Captain America decided to surrender, the heroes had to face all the destruction their fight had caused. Sue and Johnny were granted amnesty and they try to reconstruct the streets where the battle took place. In an attempt to reconcile their relationship, Reed is able to convince Sue to come back to him and go on a second honeymoon. He takes Sue to one of the moons of Saturn to try and rekindle their love, as well as give her their first true honeymoon, since they never had one. During their absence, Storm and Black Panther filled in for them along side Ben and Johnny.</p><h3>New Fantastic Four</h3><p>The new team's first mission was to find the body of their friend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gravity/29-40452/\">Gravity</a> which was taken by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/epoch/29-6143/\">Epoch</a> in the story in order to recover him as the Protector of the Universe. However, the Silver Surfer, who has returned to being a Herald of Galactus, was tracking down Epoch, in order to feed her to Galactus, seeing her as an energy source capable of fulfilling his master's hunger. The team traveled to space and confronted the Surfer who, after a brief battle with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>, agreed to help them find their friend but Epoch will be fed to Galactus. Surfer then told Thing that he is a Herald again because he realized that Galactus' is hunger is not related in the story to good or evil.</p><p>However, the recovered Gravity and the Fantastic Four refused to allow Galactus consume Epoch. The Black Panther, using a device similar to the one used by Doctor Doom that takes away the Surfer's Cosmic Powers, fought and defeated the Surfer but they were still no match for Galactus himself. Gravity used all the powers given to him by Epoch to feed Galactus, who restored the Surfer's powers and spared Epoch.</p><h3>Second Honeymoon</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2216464\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216464-ff_548___3a.jpg\" title=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\"><img id=\"2216464\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2216464-ff_548___3a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">FF 548 - Sue is a hostage of the Frightful Four yet again</div></div></div></div><p>In the stories, Reed takes Sue to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titan/34-41103/\">Titan</a>, one of the moons of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saturn/34-56294/\">Saturn</a>, as a means for them to have a honeymoon, since they never took one when they originally married. While there, Reed discovers a strange object and begins to examine it. Unfortunately he is unsure of it and he teleports back to Earth so other scientists can see and help him determine what it was. In order to do so, however, he left Sue alone on the ship in which they traveled to Titan, where she was ambushed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frightful-four/65-11439/\">Frightful Four</a>. Sue fought them off for as long as she could, but she was defeated. The Wizard proved his superb intellect by creating a gun which was set to the frequency of Sue's force field. One shot of the gun and Sue fell to the ground, unconscious. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/29-3287/\">Wizard</a> placed a power dampener on her, making her totally helpless. Sue was held prisoner on her own ship, all in the hopes that Sue, as well as everyone else, recognize the Wizard as Reed's superior. Sue refuses to acknowledge him as her husbands superior, and he attacks her, now that she's subdued. The slap that the Wizard gives Sue is even more brutal than the one Reed delivered to her in FF 281. So much for a second honeymoon, as Sue has become a hostage of the Frightful Four for the third time in Fantastic Four history, the other two being Silver Age FF 38 and FF: The World's Greatest Comic Magazine 9 of 12. Reed, along with Johnny, Ben, Storm, and Black Panther head for the ship to stop the Frightful Four and rescue Sue.</p><p>Sue is subjected to attacks by the Wizard but eventually Reed and the rest of the team manage to return to the ship. Once there, Storm found Sue and released her from the special machine that neutralized Sue's powers. As a means of revenge, Sue threatened the Wizard with creating a force field around his heart. The Wizard, intimidated by the more powerful Sue, subsequently faints and the Frightful Four are then rocketed out into space on a smaller vessel.</p><h3>Brand New Day</h3><p>Before the Civil War, Spider-Man's identity was shared among many super-heroes including the Fantastic Four. On one occasion they in-listed Peter's help in journeying with them to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/macroverse/34-56470/\">Macroverse</a> where they helped save a princess from a group of barbarians. During this whole encounter, Peter never wore his mask.</p><p>In present time, The Fantastic Four seek Peter's help again in journeying to the Macroverse, from where Reed received a distress signal. At first Spidey refuses to go but then accepts after Reed produces him a check to pay his bills. However, after <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/one-more-day/39-49939/\">One More Day</a>, the Fantastic Four have also forget of Spidey's identity, making the Human Torch, who was once a very close friend to both Peter and Spider-Man, very skeptical. When they arrive at the Macroverse, they discover five statues of themselves, the inhabitants of the Macroverse idolize them for their previous adventure. Once the Johnny realizes that the unmasked Spider-Man's statue's face is unrecognizable, he recalls that he once knew more about Spider-Man and wants to know what he did that caused them to forget who he is. When Spidey refuses to answer and declares that he won't go down that road again and that no one will ever know his secret, an angered Human Torch burns off Spidey's mask but Susan uses her powers to protect Peter's face and lashes out at Johnny for betraying Spidey's trust. However, they are in a war-zone between two races, and the combined might of Spider-Man and the Fantastic Four was able to return the Macroverse to peace. When they were heading back to Earth, Reed asks Spidey about his secret identity and how he was able to have everyone forget it. Spidey tells him that it was the result of a special spell that prevents anyone from knowing Peter's identity unless Peter himself unmasks. Johnny urges Peter to unmask since they're all friends but Peter still refuses until Reed tells him that he has a \"psychic firewall\" that allowing them to know his identity and keep it to themselves. Peter agrees and unmasks and they renew their friendship.</p><h3>Planet Hulk &amp; World War Hulk</h3><p>The Hulk, who is now under the control of Banner, was sent to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/las-vegas/34-55734/\">Las Vegas</a> by the Fantastic Four to investigate a Hydra <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gamma-bomb/18-55673/\">Gamma Bomb</a>. However, things went horribly wrong and the bomb detonated in his face so Human Torch and the Thing are sent to bring back the Hulk before more people get hurt. But Bruce doesn't seem to be in control any more, as the Hulk now appears as a bald Grey Hulk. As Ben and Johnny fight this mindless Hulk, he seems to be recalling some of the tragic events in his life. Ben realizes that some-thing's wrong with him and that the explosion somehow messed up his mind. Ben told Johnny that he and the Hulk were both hit by something that made them monsters people need but don't want and that \"monsters understand monsters\". He attempts to reason with the Hulk despite Torch's protests. However, this doesn't work and Hulk recalls Betty's death and hallucinates that Thing is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abomination/29-3489/\">Abomination</a> (who killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/betty-ross/29-3445/\">Betty</a>) and savagely attacks the Thing who doesn't fight back. Hulk hits Thing so hard, Ben is immobilized and tastes blood and before Hulk could finish Thing off, Human Torch goes nova but it didn't seem to have any effect on him until the Hulk told them not to worry about him and that he's fine.</p><p>The fight in Las Vegas caused a lot of destruction so, the Illuminati were debating on whether or not Hulk should remain on Earth. Reed, Iron Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, and Doctor Strange were all for sending Hulk into outer space, so he wouldn't harm anyone ever again. However, their plan didn't work out as they planned, as the Hulk, now stronger than ever, returned to Earth and declared war on the Illuminati, including Reed. When the Hulk came for Reed, with the help of Susan and the New Fantastic Four, he projected a hologram of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> in order to calm the Hulk down, but his plan backfired and the Hulk defeated the Fantastic Four and captured him. The Hulk had built a gladiatorial arena in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a> and equipped Reed and Tony with obedience disks, forcing them to fight each other to the death. Reed defeated Tony but Hulk spared because he came for justice, not murder. During the final battle between Sentry and the Hulk, Stark used a satellite cannon to finally defeat the Hulk.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illuminati/65-40421/\">Illuminati</a> investigated the corpse of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a> who turned out to be a Skrull when Black Bolt revealed himself to be a Skrull himself and attacked the other members only to be killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>. The Illuminati then separated since anyone of them could be a Skrull. Reed and Hank Pym were examining the body of the Skrull in order to find out why the Skrulls are undetectable. When Reed discovered why, Hank revealed himself to be a Skrull and shot Reed with a special gun, destabilizing him.</p><p>He was taken to a Skrull armada in orbit where he was tortured by the Skrulls until being save by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sword/65-41666/\">SWORD</a> agent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abigail-brand/29-4441/\">Abigail Brand</a>. Using the information he discovered in the lab, Reed was able to develop a weapon that undoes the Skrulls shape-shifting abilities. Brand and Richards both traveled to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a> where they used this weapon to identify the Skrulls during their battle with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2220918\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe.jpg\" title=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\"><img id=\"2220918\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2220918-ff___secret_invasion_3bbe_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four 1</div></div></div></div><p>Susan was on a speaking tour around the world when she was attacked in her hotel room by Skrull Reed who used a forcefield to knock her out and neutralize her. That same Skrull took the form of Susan in order to infiltrate the Baxter Building while Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria were there, and opened a portal to the Negative Zone causing half the building along with everyone in it, the Skrull Susan, Ben, Johnny, Franklin and Valeria, to be sucked in. While in the Negative Zone, they were attacked by Bug-like monsters. While Ben protected the kids from the \"bugs\", Johnny and Sue made it back to Reed's lab where they debated on who she really was. He asked her what her favorite movie was to which she answered wrong. The Skrull revealed herself to be Lyja, Johnny's ex. They fight and Lyja is captured by a Negative Zone monster but Torch saves her and they kiss for old times' sake. Franklin and Valeria make their way back to the lab to get a machine their dad built for them for defensive purposes and they help Thing fight off the rest of the bugs. Franklin suggests that they should free the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tinkerer/29-3144/\">Tinkerer</a> from his N-Zone prison in order to help them fix the Baxter Building. While on their way to the prison on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantasti-car-mk-i/18-42331/\">Fantasticar</a>, Valeria falls off, only to be saved by Lyja, who reveals that she was sent to kill them all but because of her feelings for Johnny she sent them to the N-Zone instead. The Thing frees the Tinkerer, and after an agreement, he manages to return the building to normal. As they make their way back to a ruined New York, Lyja decides to stay behind.</p><p>Sue was revealed to be held captive on another Skrull ship along with other heroes and villains, who were freed and returned back to Earth when Iron Man destroyed the Skrull ship. After returning to Earth, she reunited with Reed and they both checked on their family before joining the final battle along side their fellow heroes against the Skrulls.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>When the Fantastic Four were attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammer/65-56065/\">HAMMER</a> agents, Reed built a device called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-bridge/18-56497/\">Bridge</a> which allowed him in the story to explore alternate dimensions. The team was sent to other continuities, leaving Franklin and Valeria under siege from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a>, HAMMER agents and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a>. Valeria was able to outsmart them and separate Osborn from his agents and led in a room where he was confronted by Franklin wearing a Spider-Man mask, calling him a villain. While Osborn is chasing the children holding a gun, the Fantastic Four make their way back to the Baxter Building where an enraged Invisible Woman scream at Osborn to stay away from her children. However, the insane Osborn challenges her to make him, which she does by knocking him down with a forcefield and preventing his remaining forces from reaching him. Reed tells Osborn to leave and never return but he replies by attempting to shoot Reed, only to be shot by Franklin. However, Franklin was holding a harmless toy gun, having Ben and Johnny thinking that Franklin's powers may have returned. Sue then told Reed to destroy the Bridge which he did but secretly he put it back together.</p><h3>Prime Elements; the end of a Family</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2221100\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party.jpg\" title=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\"><img id=\"2221100\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2221100-ff_574___franklin_s_birthday_party_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fantastic Four 574 - Franklin's birthday party</div></div></div></div><p>On Franklin's birthday, an older Franklin infiltrated the Baxter Building and used a forcefield to prevent the team from reaching him. He then confronted Franklin and seemingly knock him down, angering the team. He then entered Valeria's room and informed her about the coming conflict between four cities and that the only hope is Doom. He urged her not to tell anyone of this encounter before she recognized him as her brother. When Reed was finally able to penetrate the forcefield, Future Franklin teleported away. In his bedroom, little Franklin formed a pocket Universe, hinting that his ultimate powers may have fully resurfaced. Deep within the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/antarctica/34-55940/\">Antarctic</a> underground Lake Vostok, the team made contact with the Lost Tribes of Atlantis who appointed Sue as their representative with the Outside world.

It was the only way to do it, according to Valeria en Thirty-Two, member of the group formed by Reed Richards; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/future-foundation/65-57552/\">the Future Foundation</a>.</p><p>The seeming demise of the Human Torch has ripped the Fantastic Four apart and the group known as the FF disbanded. It was revealed that all the other members of the old Fantastic Four team will be joining the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/future-foundation/65-57552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Future Foundation</a> team, including new member Spider-Man.</p><h2><b>New Fantastic Four</b></h2><p>A team of Marvel Superheroes who briefly became a replacement Fantastic Four in the early 1990's.</p><h2>Fantastic Four Suits</h2><p>Reed had invented specialized suits made of unstable molecules which could adapt to him and his teammates' powers. For him, his suit allows him to stretch to great lengths without tearing it. The costume also makes them harmless against electrical attacks. They are also computers. In them, they have something equivalent to a computer. It forms a network, keeping the team up to date. It also displays data for them and touchpad controls are available on their gauntlets. The costume is like a GPS, providing their location. It has a scanner which can scan things in their environment, being able to scan things like how many people are in the room next to them.</p><h3>Members</h3><ul><li>Spider-Man- once tried to \"apply\" to the team but reconsidered when he wasn't gonna get paid.</li><li>Hulk -in the Grey Hulk and the Professor personality in different occasions.</li><li>Wolverine</li><li>Ghost Rider -Danny Ketch version.</li></ul><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192173\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192173-nffvff_super.jpg\" title=\"The Fantastic Four V.S The New Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1192173\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192173-nffvff_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Fantastic Four V.S The New Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Fantastic Four V.S The New Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>When a female Skrull captured the original team, she impersonated the Invisible Woman to recruit a new team to avenge the \"death\" of the original and to steal a weapon from the Mole Man.</p><p>The team reassembled again by Doctor Strange to arrest the Human Torch for his actions that destroyed a quarter of a city.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486710\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four_super.jpg\" title=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\"><img id=\"486710\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486710-250px_ultimate_fantastic_four_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Fantastic Four of Earth-1610</div></div></div></div><p><b>Earth-1610</b></p><p>The Fantastic Four of the Ultimate universe is composed younger versions of the original four, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>. The origin of these four is different than the original. Reed Richards enters a Think Tank in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baxter-building/34-41454/\">Baxter Building</a> along with Sue Storm her father Richard Storm, one of the caretakers, Johnny Storm her brother and Victor Van Dame. He started in the think tank trying to create a teleportation device and joined work with Victor to get better results. When they had finally acquired results that seemed promising they tried it out. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Ben Grim</a> a childhood friend of Reed went to see the launch.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486712\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486712-ultimate_fantastic_four_001_super.jpg\" title=\"The Ultimate Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"486712\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486712-ultimate_fantastic_four_001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Ultimate Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Ultimate Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>The five of them were side by side trying to teleport an apple but got teleported instead. The teleportation consisted of going through something called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">Negative Zone</a> and the moment the five entered the N-Zone (a reality where the teleportation takes place as a mediator) affecting their DNA giving them superpowers. Reed could stretch to different lengths and didn't need to eat,drink or breathe. Sue could generate invisible force fields and arrange light making her invisible. Johnny could generate fire and fly. Ben turned into a rock brute with super strength. When Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny came together once again faced an old Baxter teacher now going as the Mole Man. The four face his mole men and won.</p><p>Later they decided to find <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Victor</a>. They found him in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a> where he was manipulating the locals with dragon tattoos. He now had metal instead of skin. He went against the four but he could not be arrested in Latveria.

While on the N-Zone, N-ihil pretended to be the Four's friend and explained how realities are stacked on the universe. That's when they became enemies. They returned home along with some sort of dinosaur leaving Annihilus in the N-Zone. Then they faced an old think tank jealous Brainiac going by the name The Thinker. She took over the Baxter Building and started going up against Reed. Brain against brain. The better genius won and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mad-thinker/29-2131/\">Thinker</a>, Rhona Burchill, escaped. Johnny went to school with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a> (AKA Spider-man). Johnny fell for a girl named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/liz-allen/29-15408/\">Liz Allen</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">MJ</a>, Peter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kong/29-12490/\">Kong</a>, Liz and Johnny went to the beach together. There he was seen using his powers. Liz being mutant-phobic stopped talking to him so Peter as Spidey went and cheered him up. Reed made contact with himself and the rest of the FF from another universe making them become the Ultimate Frightful Four.</p><p>Reed trying to cure Ben decided to change time. As a result <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> went to earth and gave them pills to give them superpowers. In the end they were betrayed by them all and they all died for the exception for Ben Grimm who didn't take the pill. He fought the Super-Skrull that used a suit to copy their powers. With no powers to be able to copy Ben took over and went back in time to stop the stopping of the accident. Again they faced the Frightful Four zombies and Doom went down along with them trying to be a hero. Spider-Man had a clone crisis and went to the FF for help. One of the clones who thought was Peter's father asked Sue to be his friend before dying. Reed cured <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">MJ</a> from a monster transformation she was having because of the clones. Then they gave the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scorpion/29-4484/\">Scorpion</a> clone to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Ga Lak Tus</a> was going to destroy the world and the FF did their part in stopping him. Teaming up with Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimates/65-40504/\">Ultimates</a> they got information from the Kree.</p><p>Reed created a machine that would damage Ga Lak Tus with the help of the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>. The Fantastic Four then went up against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gallowglass/29-51527/\">Gallowglass</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a>. They also faced their father <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> and got out of the problem with the help of Seed. The Thinker came back stealing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro's</a> hard drive and making the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> believe that it was the FF's fault. In the end they teamed up to defeat her. Then they faced Diablo a guy who created a teleportation from past to present and relied on magic.</p><p>After the Fantastic Four first encountered Thanos in his home dimension, Thanos implanted the idea for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a> in Reed Richard's mind. Legend told that Thanos had discovered the original Cosmic Cube after it feel from the sky above his planet. With it he would attempt to control all existence. Thanos' defeat was narrow, and the costs were great. While Reed believed that he was creating the cosmic cube out of his own accord, Thanos was controlling Reed in order to re-create the powerful weapon that he once lost. As Reed continued to analyze the possibilities contained within the energy lattice, he found the draw of creating a cube irresistible. Reed's first attempt to harness the energy required for fueling the cube would result in the Fantastic Four's first encounter with the real Silver Surfer as well as the inter-dimensional being that they would com to know as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psycho-man/29-7112/\">Psycho-Man</a>.</p><p>Sue then had to face <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-ghost/29-2473/\">Red Ghost</a>. After the Red Ghost's defeat Reed would continue to work on developing the Cube. She went by herself to what she thought was a conference but was caught with the woman who became the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-ghost/29-2473/\">Red Ghost</a>. With the help of the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson-dynamo/29-7234/\">Crimson Dynamo</a> the rest of the FF saved Sue. Because of the actions of Reed while building the cube their relationship was broken off. When he finished the cube it automatically protected <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a> from an attack from Seed. Thanos' forces would spring foreword, removing a block of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a> containing the Four to take back to his home dimension. Thanos battled Reed in order to take the cube by force. While the Cube was a powerful weapon, Reed's inexperience wielding it made him susceptible to Thanos' power, and Reed was seemingly destroyed before Thanos acquired the cube. Using the power of the cube, Thanos came into our reality and took over the minds and wills of Earth's superheroes including the Ultimates, the X-Men, the remaining members of the Fantastic Four, and all solo heroes. These heroes in turn helped Thanos capture any remaining rebels. Thanos was disturbed because he could tell that he somehow didn't have full access to the Cube's vast powers as he once did.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"504374\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51_super.jpg\" title=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\"><img id=\"504374\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/504374-mr._fantastic_thanos_nic_klein51_medium.jpg\" alt=\"War over the Cosmic Cube\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">War over the Cosmic Cube</div></div></div></div><p>Meanwhile, Ben Grimm had located Thanos' estranged daughter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atrea/29-53792/\">Atrea</a> who helped him realize that Reed was not actually dead. During his battle with Thanos Reed used the power of the Cosmic Cube to create a charred likeness of himself, while turning his actual form into an energy being. This move allowed him to escape Thanos' full power by being perceived as dead. Atrea felt Reed was still alive but trapped, and freed his essence.</p><p>Convincing Atrea to rebel against her father, the three traveled back to their home dimension to battle Thanos. In the middle of the warped landscape of New York they found his citadel. With Atrea and Ben acting as a diversion Reed was able to get to Thanos to battle for control of the Cosmic Cube. While in partial control of the Cosmic Cube, Reed knew he was no match for Thanos' power.</p><p>The small portion of the Cube's power which Thanos previously was denied access to was Reed's work. Reed unlocked this sequestered power within the Cube, giving Thanos full access to the Cube's infinite resources. With full access to the Cosmic Cube restored, Thanos' physical form quickly deteriorated as he died. Thanos' infatuation with death had created a subconscious drive within himself, and it was that desire for the fullness of death that destroyed Thanos.</p><p>This left Reed the question of what to do with the Cube. It's vast powers had proven to dangerous for anyone, even himself, to wield. In order to deal with the Cube Reed opened up a very small rift in space and time and dropped the cube through. The cube plummeted through the rift and landed on Thanos' home planet many years earlier. The cube found its way to the sand in front of Thanos' very feet. The resulting paradox was that the original Cosmic Cube, the cube that Thanos had tricked Reed into building for him, was actually the Cosmic Cube that Reed had designed and built.</p><p>After the Cosmic Cube event Sue went up with a new mystery. An giant egg was found along with the ex-Think Tank people now living underground. The the Ultimate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/salems-seven/65-41219/\">Salem's Seven</a> appeared into the picture trying to stop a flaming building and getting all the glory.</p><p><strong>March on Ultimatum</strong></p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of Captain America, Wolverine, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Shadowcat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimatum/39-55745/\">Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards.</p><p>The then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a> from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverines and Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott</a>. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over a s Captain America after Steve Rogers aged 100 years, then he died. In the future <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be Johnny he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, Namor and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops\u00b4s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. Ben and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/29-10964/\">Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue\u00b4s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother\u00b4s death. Everyone let the future hero\u00b4s free from a prison in the N-Zone Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that future would not happen.</p><h3>Ultimatum</h3><p>It's Tuesday 4:12 PM. Reed Richards is about to propose to Sue. Ben Grim is working out with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/herbie/29-23720/\">H.E.R.B.I.E</a> watching over. Johnny Storm and his father are having a heated argument on Johnny's intelligence.</p><p>It's Tuesday 4:13 PM. New York is underwater.</p><p>At the Baxter Building, Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Girl reach the roof top. A whale enters the room with the Thing, Johnny and Franklin Storm are underwater. At their rooftop of the Baxter, Sue uses all her power to keep the water away from New York and then she collapses. The Thing arrives and Reed leaves Sue with him.</p><p>At 4:21 PM, Reed is already on an FF submarine and meets with Namor. Reed accuses him of the event while Namor excuses himself saying it was not him.</p><p>It's 12:31 AM in Latveria and all except Dr. Doom are frozen solid.</p><p>Then, telepathically Xavier tells all superheroes, that he knows who is responsible for this events, and that all of them have to unite against this threat, to stop <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>.</p><p>Back in the Baxter, Ben takes over and is now alone. The Baxter Building is turning invisible and Sue isn't stable. No scientist knows how to help her, and the one scientist who might have a chance of saving her is dead, Franklin Storm is dead.</p><p>The Thing has gone out of resources and Sue\u00b4s mother then arrives. She suggest that the person who could help would be Dr. Molveick a.k.a. The Mole Man. With the help of the students from Baxter B help Ben find Mole Man and save him from fire mole men. As a result he helps the Thing figures out that the way to help Sue is to internally help her. Using <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pym-particles/12-42077/\">Pym particles</a> the Thing and the Mole man are going to go inside the Invisible Girl.</p><p>The Thing and the Mole Man Successfully rescue Sue from herself by going inside. Inside they fix the problem and then after that Sue recovers completely. During the journey inside Sue Ben and Dr. Molevick found some strange antibodies that attacked them. Sue explained that these weren't antibodies, they were actually some form of robotic organisms implanted inside her by Reed without any of the Fantastic Four's knowledge. Because of this Sue realized that with he GPS system imbedded in them she could locate Johnny. So she gets to work.</p><p>Sue realizes that they need a huge antenna to locate Reed and Johnny around the world, so Sue's mother explains how advanced Atlantean technology could become useful here. Sue, Dr. Molevick, Mrs. Richards and Ben head into deep waters to get this technology. On their dive they discover some other Atlantean fugitives that were locked up. After being captured, since they couldn't surpass the power of these people, Sue's mother makes a deal that gets them out of the mess. They leave from Atlantis and create the necessary equipment to locate the nanobots implanted in Johnny and Reed. A mapping system appears showing the location of the rest of the team but it shows they aren't necessarily on earth. On a different earth Reed is with Dr. Doom and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-princess/29-6912/\">Princess Zarda</a> while Johnny is in a dimension where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a>, a demon lord, rules.</p><p>Hulk and Spider-Man see Doctor Strange's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sanctum-sanctorum/34-55966/\">Sanctum Sanctorum</a> blowing up. Magical beings start bursting out of control and Hulk and Spidey try and stop it. Dormammu, powered by the Human Torch, appears and kills everything in his path, apparently including Spider-Man.</p><p>Doctor Strange tries fighting off this monster but fails and get's killed in the process.</p><p>Now that Sue and Ben have located Johnny they go in to get him back. The Invisible Woman uses a forcefield over Dormammu's head cutting the oxygen from the monster and Johnny gives it all it's got to cut his breathing off. The effect brings him to turn back into a little man re-unites the Storms and 3/4 of the FF.</p><p>Reed finally comes back with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> and he along Doctor Doom and Princess Zardra take the fight to Magneto. The X-Men take the battle to Magneto and what's left of his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">brotherhood</a>. Nick Fury, with the help of Jean, shows Magneto how mutants are just a man-made accident. After this Cyclops kills Magneto.</p><h3>Post-Ultimatum</h3><p>After the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimatum/39-55745/\">Ultimatum</a>, Sue and Reed break up and the Fantastic Four are officially disbanded. Reed goes back to his parent's house, Sue takes over the Baxter Building for herself, burying herself in work, Ben joins the military and Johnny starts to travel.</p><p>After some time Johnny got tired of traveling around so instead of going to the Baxter he arrived on Peter Parker's doorstep. After talking to his sister he decides to live with the Parkers, Iceman and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\">Gwen Stacy</a> all while going to high school.</p><h3>Ultimate Enemy</h3><p>Reed Richards, now ex-leader of the world famous Fantastic Four, now lives with his parents and his father is not happy about that especially since he has no job to contribute to the family. After being brutally woken up by his father, Reed's computer detects an energy flux, and then somebody knocks at the door, even though Reed warns his father not to open the door, he opens it, and a purple, cloud-like explosion happens inside the Richard's home.</p><p>Sue uses her invisible powers to hide herself from the rest of the world while taking a walk in the city. She feels better when not having to be a world spectacle to the rest of the world. Once back in the Baxter she wonders all alone the place only to find Ben Grim interrupts her loneliness. After a brief catching up between the two, Sue examines Ben's recent shedding of rocks and Ben drops a bomb on her by telling her that he loves her. Now that her relationship with Reed is over he took the opportunity to tell her that. One of the Thing's rocks falls and leaves Sue by saying: \"something to remember me by\". Then a huge, purple, cloud/octopus-like creatures overtakes the Baxter building and Ben even when trying to stop it he is thrown to a street.</p><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486717\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30_super.jpg\" title=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\"><img id=\"486717\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486717-ultimate_fantastic_four_30_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Zombie Four of Earth-2149\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Zombie Four of Earth-2149</div></div></div></div><p>*In the Zombie Universe the Fantastic Four as most other heroes are transformed into zombies.

It was simply made so that the property could be copyrighted, though the directors (Roger Corman/Bernd Eichinger) and creators were left unaware of this fact, and so it was not intended to be released. The film depicted the origin of the Fantastic Four and their first battles with Dr. Doom and Mole Man.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"486675\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie_super.jpg\" title=\"The Fantastic Four (1994)\"><img id=\"486675\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/486675-picfffirstmovie_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Fantastic Four (1994)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Fantastic Four (1994)</div></div></div></div><p>In 1994, a film about the Fantastic Four was produced in order that the studio, Constantin Film, could secure the rights to the group. Unknown to the director, crew and actors of the film, this movie was never intended to be released. The film starts with Reed and Victor Von Doom in college. An experiment goes goes wrong and Victor is allegedly killed. Reed's friend introduces him to her children Sue (a teenager) and Johnny (a preteen). Reed grieves for his friend but finishes school and years starts a space expedition (one that is to be piloted by his roommate Ben Grim) and they decide to bring, a now older, Sue and Johnny along (for shits and giggles).</p><p>Little do they know that Victor Von Doom did not die the day of that horrible experiment, and to that day had been planning his revenge on the man he assumes is responsible for his experiment not working (none other than Reed Richards of course). He sabotages their ship so it flies right on course with some cosmic rays (an energy source that has unknown strength) the ship seems to be destroyed in space. Doom laughs a terrible laugh and marvels in his years of planning coming to fruition.</p><p>The group survives the cosmic ray exposure and they crash land back on earth even though their ship blew up and it shouldn't be possible. Once they find they are all alive, they also discover they all have amazing powers. Reed Richards is elastic, Sue can hide from sight, Johnny is the Human Torch, and Ben has become the Thing, with a large gravel-like exoskeleton and super strength.</p><p>All you need to know is that Doom finds out the Fantastic Four are still alive and lures them to his lair. They fight. Doom's device almost goes off. They stop it and save the day. The End.</p><p>CAST:</p><table class=\"t-editor with-border full-width\"><tbody><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Hyde-White\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alex Hyde-White</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mister_Fantastic\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards / Mister Fantastic</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebecca_Staab\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rebecca Staab</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Woman\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sue Storm / The Invisible Woman</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bailey_Smith\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Bailey Smith</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Grimm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben Grimm (but not the Thing... strange choice if you ask me)</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carl_Ciarfalio&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carl Ciarfalio</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_%28comics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Thing (but not Ben Grimm... strange choice if you ask me)</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Underwood\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jay Underwood</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Torch\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny Storm / The Human Torch</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Culp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joseph Culp</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom\" rel=\"nofollow\">Victor Von Doom/ Doctor Doom</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kat_Green&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kat Green</a></td><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Masters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alicia Masters</a></td></tr><tr><td><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ian_Trigger&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ian Trigger</a></td><td>The Jeweler</td></tr></tbody></table><h4><b>Fantastic Four</b></h4><p>Released in the US on July 8, 2005 it was the third superhero film of the year ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/223-126/\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-begins/223-12/\">Batman Begins</a> being the first and second respectively). The film was directed by Tim Story and released by 20th Century Fox, and though it was the first Fantastic Four film to be released it was the second to be filmed. This film told of the forming of the Fantastic Four and how they got their abilities. It was also a tale of their change in mindset when they slowly began to accept that it was their duty to be heroes, they were not destined to be normal, even Ben came to terms with this. The film also depicted the origins of the team's nemesis Dr. Doom and showed the characters developing their powers, pushing them to their limits and learning how they work. In the end, when working as a team they find themselves able to defeat Dr. Doom, his \"dead\" body is then shipped off to Latveria.</p><p>Among the deleted scenes included on the December 2005 DVD release:</p><ul><li>Three slightly modified scenes concerning the attack on Doctor Doom - one in which Reed uses his body as a funnel to direct a stream of water at Doom, one in which he doesn't, and one in which Doctor Doom's line \"Is that the best you can do, a little heat?\" is cut short, having the \"..a little heat?\" portion removed.</li></ul><ul><li>Two versions of a scene with Jessica Alba and Ioan Gruffudd. The original features the pair in the planetarium, where they communicate their feelings for each other without an argumentative tone. This ends in a kiss. The second version, included in the DVD release as a bonus feature, features the two outside, looking toward the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Statue_Of_Liberty\">Statue Of Liberty</a>. Similar lines are used, but it ends with Alba's Susan turning invisible before Gruffudd's Reed can kiss her. A joke was used during the line \"a stronger man\": Instead of Reed giving himself a square jaw (as he does in the theatrical release), he makes his skin look like the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/X-Men\">X-Men's</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Wolverine_%28comics%29\">Wolverine</a>. Actor Gruffudd breaks the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Fourth_wall\">fourth wall</a> and looks directly at the camera as he does this.</li></ul><ul><li>There is also a scene where Reed and Sue are in a storage room of the Baxter Building where we see on one of the shelves is a robot that is supposed to be H.E.R.B.I.E. from the 1970s Fantastic Four cartoon.</li></ul><p>The novelization of the film contained a number of scenes not in the final cut, including a small number of scenes that developed the character of Alicia Masters.</p><h4>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</h4><p>A sequel to the Fantastic Four film of 2005, this film was also directed by Tim Story. Rated PG-13, this film was released in North America on June 15, 2007 and some of its stars include:</p><ul><li>Ioan Gruffudd (Mr. Fantastic)</li><li>Jessica Alba (Invisible Woman)</li><li>Chris Evans (Human Torch)</li><li>Michael Chiklis (Thing)</li><li>Julian McMahon (Doctor Doom)</li><li>Kerry Washington (Alicia Masters)</li><li>Beau Garrett ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frankie-raye/29-11605/\">Frankie Raye</a>)</li><li>Doug Jones (Silver Surfer)</li><li>Laurence Fishburne (Surfer's Voice)</li></ul><p>Stan Lee (Stan Lee) This film starts off quite some time after the last movie ended and focuses on the upcoming marriage between Sue and Reed and their relationship/future as well as the threat the Silver Surfer poses to the world. Once again the team finds themselves needing to work together as the Earth will be devoured if they do not, forcing them to do things like working with the resurrected Doom. Eventually they try and capture the Surfer but when they succeed they realize it was the wrong thing to do and Sue frees the alien, after creating a bond with him. She learns a lot about him and eventually it is this relationship that causes him to help the Fantastic Four by driving away Galactus, turning against his master.</p><h3>Satire</h3><p>In the animated show \"The Venture Brothers\", there is super powered family know as the \"The Impossibles\". They are direct parody of the Fantastic Four.</p><ul><li>Richard \"Mr. Impossible\" Impossible- can stretch and is negligent and abusive to his family.</li><li>Sally \"The Visible Woman\" Impossible- has to concentrate to not turn her skin invisible (but her muscle tissue is still visible).</li><li>Rocket Impossible- Their son.

These heroes came together to stop the\nmenace of The Hulk but they soon discovered Loki\u2019s trickery and teamed up with\nHulk to defeat the God of Mischief. Ant-Man stated that the five work well\ntogether and suggested they combined to form a team against threats that no lone hero can deal with. The Wasp proposes the name \u201cAvengers\u201d and thus <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth\u2019s</a> Mightiest Heroes were formed. The original members are known as the\n\"founding members\" based on an Avengers Charter, to manage the good\nname of the team.

The Hulk at this time greatly divided public\nopinion. Some thought he was a misunderstood creature who just wanted to be\nleft alone. However thanks to the efforts of <a href=\"/thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\">General \u201cThunderbolt\u201d Ross</a>, the\nmajority of people viewed The Hulk as a rampaging menace. Almost from inception the Avengers team roster has been\nfluid, with the Hulk departing during their second adventure and <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain\nAmerica</a> joining soon after. The rotating roster has become a hallmark of the\nteam although one theme has been constant - The Avengers fight the foes that no\nsingle superhero could defeat - hence their famous cry of \"Avengers\nAssemble!\"</p><p>The Avengers have always accepted a diverse range of\nmembers, regardless of their backgrounds, as long as they are ready to fight\nthe good fight. To that end, the team has featured humans, <a href=\"/robots/12-56059/\">robots</a>, <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">mutants</a>, Gods,\n<a href=\"/aliens/12-46567/\">aliens</a>, supernatural beings and even former villains, such as <a href=\"/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a> and <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black\nWidow</a>. Despite the diverse nature of the team, which often results in\nsquabbling, the Avengers have always managed to unite into a cohesive unit to\ncombat the deadliest threats in the universe.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2435148\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2435148-avengers_1_2.jpg\" title=\"The other Avengers distrust The Hulk\"><img id=\"2435148\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2435148-avengers_1_2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The other Avengers distrust The Hulk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The other Avengers distrust The Hulk</div></div></div></div><p>During their first team meeting there is already inner\nsquabbling between the Avengers as Thor and Hulk exchange words.

The Space Phantom switches bodies with\neach Avenger and plants seeds of distrust and hatred amongst them. It is clear\nthat the other Avengers never truly trusted the Hulk and in fact admit to each\nother they had him join their ranks to keep an eye on him. The Space Phantom\nmanages to have the Hulk realize this distrust in the others and he leaves the\nteam.</p><p>Soon afterwards The Hulk is befriended by <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> the Sub-Mariner\nand the two <a href=\"/antiheroes/12-55830/\">antiheroes</a> form an uneasy alliance to battle their common foe -\nhumans.

But in the middle of the\nbattle Hulk changes to Bruce Banner and leaves Namor to fight the Avengers\nalone.

The heroes bring the floating body on board and realise it is Captain America, who has been in suspended animation since the Second\nWorld War. Thus the Living Legend of World War II is reborn! Initially\nCap attacks The Avengers mistaking them as threats but the issue is quickly\nsettled and The Avengers take Captain America back to <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a> where he helps\nthem defeat Namor and the alien <a href=\"/starhammer/29-50246/\">Vuk</a>.

Hank Pym (Goliath persona) who is outside hears the Wasp scream. He grows and climbs the building to rescue her and shatters the window. They take the Vision back to the Avengers Mansion and stabilize him. Hawkeye and the Black Panther make their way into the lab, but the Avengers are taken by surprise when the Vision awakens. After a brief battle, the Vision stops and tells the Avengers that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron-5</a> had sent him to attack the Avengers.</p><p>So the Avengers accompany the Vision and go to Ultron\u2019s lair. It turns out to be a trap, and the Avengers are captured. Then the unexpected happens: the Vision fights Ultron and wins, thus saving the Avengers. The Vision is then tested in melee and questioned by a whole lot of Avengers. He eventually becomes a new member.</p><p>Under the pressure of being chairman and lacking self-confidence, Hank Pym goes to his lab in the Wasp\u2019s mansion, and has an accident. The mixture of different chemicals triggers a new persona, and Hank now calls himself Yellowjacket. This persona is more confident and free willed, a total opposite to his current personality. After thwarting and bashing some thugs, Hank enters the Avengers Mansion and wants to join their ranks. He makes claims that his Yellowjacket persona killed his Goliath persona. The Avengers didn\u2019t take the news likely, so Hank grabs the Wasp and escapes to his miniature base outside the mansion. Hank then kisses the Wasp, and from that point-on the Wasp knows it is actually Hank.</p><p>The two decide to get married, and tons of superheroes make their way to the wedding of Yellowjacket and the Wasp. To everyone\u2019s surprise the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/circus-of-crime/65-23035/\">Circus of Crime</a> decide to be wedding crashers.

The culprit is revealed to be the Scarlet Witch, who has gone insane after agonizing over the memory of her lost children and loses control of her reality-altering powers.

A group of heroes formed a team called, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a>.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"108526\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war_super.jpg\" title=\"Whose Side Are You On?\"><img id=\"108526\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Whose Side Are You On?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Whose Side Are You On?</div></div></div></div><p>Trying to get high ratings for their TV show, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">New Warriors</a> came in contact with a group of super-villains in Stamford, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/connecticut/34-56118/\">Connecticut</a>. This led to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a>, who was a part of the group of villains, to explode, killing the New Warriors and killing over six hundred people, including a group of school children. With the public now fearing that super-humans were becoming a threat, Congress passes the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human Registration Act</a>. Believing this to be unconstitutional, Captain America escapes Government capture and gathers others to fight with him against the SHRA. Iron Man, in contrast, believes the SHRA was the best way to keep the public safe and keep all superheroes accountable for their own actions and worked with S.H.I.E.L.D. to help capture Captain America. This divided the super-human community, which literally became a super-human <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, leading to multiple conflicts between Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D. with Cap's \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a>,\" and left friendships and relationships broken, familirs divided, friends turned into bitter enemies, and the death of few individuals, such as Bill Foster, Goliath. The war only ended when Captain America finally surrendered after seeing the harm the war was doing, but this only ended in more bloodshed as Captain America was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america/39-54540/\">assassinated</a> shortly after surrendering.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, once learning of a secret Skrull invasion and now not being able to know who they can trust, the Avengers are even more divided. When a Skrull spaceship crash lands in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>, both the New and Mighty Avengers go to investigate, only to face off against Skrulls disguised as younger versions of different heroes. With the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, both teams unite and make make their way back to New York City, joining together with many of Earth's heroes and villains as they enter into battle in Central Park against the Skrull Empire, who are being led by the Skrull Queen <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/queen-veranke/29-54514/\">Veranke</a>, who had orchestrated the entire invasion. This battle led to the supposed death of the Wasp, the invasion was finally ended with the death of Queen Veranke at the hands of none other than Norman Osborn, who was later put in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. by the President after the battle.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-reign/39-55707/\">Dark Reign</a>, for reasons unknown, both split factions of the Avengers (New and Mighty) remain separated in their fight against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a>. Both teams have major Avengers on their teams, but the most likely reason for the division is that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a> are still trying to live up to the Earth Mightiest Heroes moniker, while the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a> are more street level in their crime fighting.</p><h3>Siege</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1117828\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1117828-siege_202_4_super.jpg\" title=\"Steve Rogers gathering the troops\"><img id=\"1117828\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1117828-siege_202_4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Rogers gathering the troops\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Steve Rogers gathering the troops</div></div></div></div><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siege/39-55985/\">Siege</a>, bringing his Dark Reign to its climax, Norman Osborn has one last objective to complete: bringing down <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a>. Teaming up with the villain, Loki, Norman frames the Asgardian <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/volstagg/29-3513/\">Volstagg</a>, giving himself an excuse to attack. Norman then leads his \"Avengers\" on an all out assault on Asgard, and the first hero to fall in the battle is none other then Thor.</p><p>As the battle rages on, Ares learns of Norman's lies and decides to join his fellow god's into battling Osborn's forces. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maria-hill/29-40824/\">Maria Hill</a> then rescues Thor from Norman's men, and helps him escape back into town to heal. Back at the Avengers hideout in Brooklyn, the newly returned Steve Rogers, in uniform, rallies the New and Young Avengers along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-warriors/65-54569/\">Secret Warriors,</a> and they then head to Asgard. Back in Asgard, Ares has a change of heart and finds and attacks Norman, but is stopped by Sentry, who, after a short struggle rips Ares in half, killing him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daken/29-42501/\">Daken</a>, who was sent into Broxton to find Thor, locates him, but Thor hits him with a bolt of lightning and declares that he will not hide from Norman or his men, Osborn then sends Sentry in to finish Thor off. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/taskmaster/29-4578/\">Taskmaster</a> then warns Norman to turn around, and as he does, he sees Cap's shield flying straight for him.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1154316\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1154316-siege003_int_lr_0003_4_super.jpg\" title=\"Avengers Assemble!\"><img id=\"1154316\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51843/1154316-siege003_int_lr_0003_4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers Assemble!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers Assemble!</div></div></div></div><p>Cap's shield then nails Norman on the head, knocking him back as Cap along with the New and Young Avengers and Fury and his Warriors come in behind him as Cap yells \"Avengers Assemble!\" The heroes join the Asgardians and begin to fight back Osborn's forces, Thor and Maria Hill are then confronted by Sentry and Thor engages in battle with him. Norman then calls on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">The Hood</a> and his gang to join the battle. In the town, Young Avenger Speed locates Tony Stark and gives him the briefcase that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a> gave Cap before they left. The President then orders H.A.M.M.E.R. to be taken down. Thor and Sentry continue to battle, while Iron Man joins the battle, using his own armor to shutdown Osborn's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Iron Patriot</a> armor, which causes Norman to order <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> to destroy Asgard. The Sentry causes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> to break apart and fall to Broxton. Norman's suit then falls apart, revealing his now Green Goblin deformed face to the Avengers and to the news team who are filming the whole thing, showing Osborn's true face to the world. Norman then tells the heroes that they don't know what they've done, that he's the only one who can control the Sentry, he then points up to the skies where the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/void/29-11585/\">Void</a> is now, Norman then tells them that they are all dead.</p><p>The Avengers do their best to fight off the Void, but they are quickly overpowered by him. Only with the help of Loki who begged Odin for the Norn Stones, did the Avengers gain the power of the stones. Now powered up, the Avengers took the fight straight to the Void, gaining the upper hand, but this new power-up was short lived as the Void seemly kills Loki, taking away the heroes new found power. Iron Man takes control of the H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier, turning it into a giant bullet, and ramming it into the Void. The heroes find Bob begging them to kill him, but he soon reverts back into the Void, only to be finally struck down by Thor, Thor then takes the Sentry's body and throws it into the sun.</p><h3>The Heroic Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1226501\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1226501-siege_204_11_super.jpg\" title=\"Enter The Heroic Age\"><img id=\"1226501\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1226501-siege_204_11_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Enter The Heroic Age\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Enter The Heroic Age</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-heroic-age/39-56023/\">The Heroic Age</a>, the President gives Steve Rogers Norman Osborn's job as America's Top Cop, Steve accepts, but tells the President that he's going to do things his way.

Thor soon arrives, telling them that if the call is sent out, he will join their ranks once more, hearing this, Steve tells Thor that's good news since he's going to need all of the Avengers for what he has planned next.</p><p>Following those events, Steve Rogers asks various heroes and former Avengers to join his new plan. Nearly all of them enthusiastically agree, save for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>, who believes all the recent misfortunes that happened on Marvel Earth to be the Avengers fault. Steve disagrees, but leaves an opening for Simon to join if he wishes. He later assembles the main team of Avengers: Bucky Barnes as Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a>, Hawkeye, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. Steve explains the reasons for which he decided that they should be the core group, the \u201cface of a new era\u201d. He wanted a team comprised of strength, nobility, bravery, responsibility and selflessness. Several members of the group get to know each other better, while Iron Man voices his concern on being teammates with Steve once again. Steve explains that the Avengers would not answer to him, but to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maria-hill/29-40824/\">Maria Hill</a> instead.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1233900\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1233900-kang_super.jpg\" title=\"Kang returns\"><img id=\"1233900\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1233900-kang_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kang returns\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kang returns</div></div></div></div><p>At that point, a time traveling <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kang/29-2264/\">Kang the Conqueror</a> emerged.

It is a device that Iron Man conceived, but never got to actually create: a doomsday machine. Forced to do as Kang says, in fear he will activate it, the Avengers hear him out: according to Kang, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron</a> would slay the Avengers at some point in the future, and rule with an iron fist, before the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/next-avengers/65-17900/\">Avengers\u2019 children</a> eventually stop his reign \u2013 only to start their own empire, and threaten the entire universe. Kang asks the Avengers to build a time machine and travel to the future in order to stop their successors. He pledges that he will no longer harm them, but rather befriend the Avengers if they will do so.</p><p>The Avengers debate on if they should intervene, or not, and they decide to do so.

A <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\"><b>Skrull</b></a> posing as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\"><b>Black Panther</b></a> easily found out information about the Avengers fighting against the Skrull army. Once the Avengers found out that a Skrull was impersonating their fellow teammate and friend, the Avengers took him down and freed the real Black Panther. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\"><b>Iron Man</b></a> created ID cards for the Avengers so that they can have access to the mansion instead of outsiders (people outside of the team) could just walk in. Throughout the years the ID cards have gotten more advanced and are currently used by mostly all of the branching Avenging teams (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\"><b>Secret Avengers</b></a> ). The ID Cards were also created for the days during the superhero fight for freedom called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\"><b>Civil War</b></a> - as a reminder for heroes to keep their cards at all cost or suffer being thrown into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\"><b>Negative Zone</b></a> .</p><p>Though the ID Cards have come in handy, mostly any super powered villain could steal one from an Avenger member and use a shape-shifter to pose as that hero. So Iron Man (teamed with other genius heroes) made a card that needs the Avengers retina scanned. The look and ideal of the ID Card has changed throughout the years, but it is one of the Avengers greatest tools at keeping their secrets safe.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"542913\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/542913-zombie_avngers_super.jpg\" title=\"Zombie Avengers of Earth-2149\"><img id=\"542913\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/542913-zombie_avngers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Zombie Avengers of Earth-2149\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zombie Avengers of Earth-2149</div></div></div></div><p><b>Earth-2149</b></p><p>In this alternate reality, the Avengers are infected by a virus that turns everyone into a zombie who craves for flesh no matter what.

That was the motivation that spurred him to create his \"Master Mold\", a servitor/controller that would command the many 'Sentinels' that Trask would create later. Unfortunately the A.I. it had been given, began to grow exponentially and Master Mold became sentient, and made sure his progeny acquired this ability also. Ironically, unbeknown to Trask he had fathered two children who would grow up to become mutants: Tanya (and Lawrence) who had the ability of time travel and due to the instability of her power became lost in the timestream. When Bolivar discovered that Lawrence was 'Gifted' with Precognition, he went to great lengths to create a device that would disguise his son's genetic ability (from his guardians) and hid it within an amulet, that He gave Lawrence, after Bolivar realized his son had predicted his wife's death. Trask had created Humanity's guardian in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/master-mold/29-10254/\">Master Mold</a>, but had Not factored in Sentinel Logic in problem-solving, \"We were created to be the Guardians of Mankind - and to guard them properly we must RULE them completely\". Master Mold commanded the existing Sentinels to capture their creator and return with him, So that he could commence the creation of a vast army of Sentinels with the intention of World domination. Trask, after witnessing Beast's interrogation under the Psycho-probe realized that it was He, who had created the threat. To destroy Master Mold, he sacrificed himself by triggering an explosion. The X-Men barely escaped, Bolivar was found by his son, and who, from that day blamed Mutants (specifically the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> ) for his father's demise, and made it his project to vastly improve on his father's design, initially converting the Mk I's then eventually creating the superior Mark II Sentinels. They could identify/determine a Mutant's power from a distance due to an encyclopaedic database and Advanced scanning equipment and could conceive a plan to nullify/neutralize All mutant powers/attacks, and incapacitate any opponent. Judge Chalmers (a close family friend) abhorred by Lawrence's extreme solution, (and privy to the family secret) decided to shock his young ward by snatching the amulet about his neck (That, to that day had hidden his presence from his servitors) No longer masked by the amulet, his former servitors, apprehended Trask and followed his last order as their leader, \"<b>Secure</b> All Mutants in area - - and <b>DESTROY</b> them\", Needless to say the X-Men triumphed and saved the Day. In a future confrontation with his creations, Lawrence became involved, when Quicksilver used him, to locate his sister (the Scarlet Witch) who had been abducted by the Sentinels, in their latest scheme to rid the world of Mutants. Unfortunately, He too, came to an untimely end, crushed beneath one of his creations Like his Father.</p><p>Even though two generations of Sentinels had failed in their objective, the technology still lived on, the US government took possession of Trask's plans, wherein (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steven-lang/29-14861/\">Steven Lang</a> and later) <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">Sebastian Shaw</a> set out to build a new line of Sentinels.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Sentinels were created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.

Aged by a bubble that bent space and time, the Cuckoos joined the X-Men. It was eventually discovered that there were actually a thousand more clones of Emma Frost who had been created by the Weapon Plus program. They were collectively known as \"Weapon XIV\". These surplus clones were destroyed by the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a> while it possessed the body of Celeste.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Stepford Cuckoos were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ethan-van-sciver/26-9317/\">Ethan Van Sciver.</a> They first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-x-men/49-18078/\">New X-Men #118</a>. Originally Grant Morrison intended the first letter of each of the girls name to spell <strong>S-P-I-C-E,</strong> but as he never finished naming the girl, the last was named Mindee. This was later corrected by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matt-fraction/26-42266/\">Matt Fraction</a>, who attributed the name Irma to Mindee.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Riot at Xavier's</h3><p><b>For further details see:</b> <a href=\"/riot-at-xaviers/39-43639/\">Riot at Xavier's</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134067\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134067-192827-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Top Students\"><img id=\"134067\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134067-192827-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Top Students\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Top Students</div></div></div></div><p>During the student riot on opening day headed by Quentin Quire - a student, powerful telepath, and the Cuckoos' chief rival who had an unrequited love for Sophie - Emma offhandedly chastised the girls for hiding during the riot rather than assisting to end it, as she felt true heroes should. Inspired by Emma's words, Sophie used Kick to increase the Cuckoos' abilities and used Cerebra to stop Quentin. Although Quentin was defeated, the overexertion and her sister Esme's unknown telepathic suggestion resulted in Sophie's death.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134061\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134061-58664-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Open Day\"><img id=\"134061\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134061-58664-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Open Day\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Open Day</div></div></div></div><p>The remaining Cuckoos were later awarded for their bravery and outstanding use of telepathy in line with the ideals of the Institute. After Sophie's untimely death, they began calling themselves the Four-In-One. The Cuckoos blamed Emma Frost for Sophie's death, and separated themselves from her. This hurt her greatly. The Stepford Cuckoos then telepathically communicated with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> while at a gathering, not only to test the new limits on their reduced powers, but also to tell her about Emma's telepathic affair with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott.</a> Jean furiously confronted Emma and trampled through Emma's mind, humiliating her. Emma managed to barely hold out against this attack in her diamond form until Scott willingly showed Jean that nothing had happened. Emma was later discovered in her diamond form, shattered in pieces, having been shot by a diamond bullet while in her diamond body, which had one flaw. To help find the murderer, Sage and Bishop came to investigate. They found that Angel Salvador killed Emma, but was being mind-controlled by Esme, who was working for Xorn (Magneto). Deciding to flee, Esme told the other Cuckoos that she desired individuality and that Emma Frost did not care about them, but instead only wanted to make them like her. Bishop and Sage confronted Esme as she was leaving. Esme telepathically defeated both of them and joined Xorn/Magneto.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"162230\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/162230-65947-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Sophie's death\"><img id=\"162230\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/162230-65947-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie's death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sophie's death</div></div></div></div><p>Xorn, believing himself to be Magneto, began destroying New York, planning to reverse the magnetic poles and leading a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with Esme as a member. Esme believed that Xorn/Magneto reciprocated her feelings of love, but he rejected her. During the chaos, the X-Men joined together to stop him, and Celeste, Phoebe and Mindee used their telepathy to safely guide civilians to safety.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"187930\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187930-186482-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Esme's death\"><img id=\"187930\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187930-186482-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Esme's death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Esme's death</div></div></div></div><p>Hurt by his rejection and concerned for Xorn/Magneto's sanity, Esme and the others turned against him. Esme used her telepathy to destroy Xorn's mind. This caused him to lash out and kill her by magnetically ripping out her earrings and forcing them into her brain. Esme died in Emma Frost's arms, with Emma saying, \"...you turned into such a wonderful little femme fatale in the end, didn't you? I\u2019m ever so proud of all my girls but you ... I think I\u2019m most especially proud of you, dear.\" Despite this, Esme's last words to Emma were \"...Nothing like you...\".</p><p>With Esme's death, the girls resolved their differences with Emma and called themselves the Three-in-One.</p><p>The three remaining Stepford Cuckoos were members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsairs/65-46826/\">Corsairs</a>, until they disbanded following M-Day. The Stepford Cuckoos were instrumental to defeating Blob, whose few vulnerabilities included telepathy. They were also seen going to the dance with Hellion. The three survived the depowering caused by Decimation, and remained as students at the school.</p><h3>The Phoenix Endsong</h3><p><b>For further details see:</b> <a href=\"/phoenix-endsong/39-51111/\">Phoenix Endsong</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"169131\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/169131-97989-kid-omega_super.jpg\" title=\"Kid Omega with Sophie's Body\"><img id=\"169131\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/169131-97989-kid-omega_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kid Omega with Sophie's Body\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kid Omega with Sophie's Body</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-omega/29-40583/\">Quentin Quire</a> awoke from his psionic stasis when the Phoenix manifested itself on Earth again and revived the recently deceased Jean Grey. Realizing that the Phoenix could revive Sophie, he unearthed her body and confronted the Phoenix, stating that he would give it whatever it wanted. The Phoenix Force revived Sophie, who took one look at Quentin as he professed his love to her, and responded, \"Eww.\" Sophie then reverted to a corpse again, preferring death to being with Quentin. The other Cuckoos assisted the X-Men as they fought the Phoenix Force by using Cerebra to contact all of the X-Men and collecting them to channel positive thoughts and love to Jean Grey. Jean Grey was then able to wrest control from the Phoenix Force and spiritually move onward to the White Hot Room, dying again. Quentin realized that Sophie would never love him and returned to a deep sleep. Meanwhile, a shard of the Phoenix communicated with one of the Cuckoos, who responded \"Oh, of course. What took you so long?\"</p><h3>Phoenix Warsong</h3><p><b>For further detail see:</b> <a href=\"/phoenix-warsong/39-51110/\">Phoenix Warsong</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"288678\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/288678-51142-celeste-cuckoo_super.jpg\" title=\"Celeste\"><img id=\"288678\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/288678-51142-celeste-cuckoo_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Celeste\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Celeste</div></div></div></div><p>In the follow-up series, X-Men: Phoenix Warsong, the Cuckoos origin was revealed, and the Cuckoos, having been contacted by the Phoenix, began manifesting new powers such as telekinesis and the ability to generate fire. The three Cuckoos each handled the Phoenix's influence differently. Celeste feared the power of the Phoenix, remembering how it drove Jean Grey insane, while Phoebe embraced its destructive powers. They went to different staff separately to try to work out their feelings and their growing identities, free of their sisters. However, before the X-Men could effectively intervene, the Phoenix took over and the Cuckoos returned to <a href=\"/the-world/34-41078/\">The World</a>, the headquarters of the Weapons Plus program. Meanwhile, Esme and Sophie mysteriously revived, albeit in decaying forms, and spoke of collecting information and realizing their true mission.</p><p>The X-Men followed the Cuckoos and learned that as creations of The World, the Cuckoos have implanted nano-technology that caused them to unknowingly transmit any and all information they encountered back to The World. Thus, Esme and Sophie did not actually return to life, but were rather piloted by their nano-technological systems. In addition, Emma learnt that the Cuckoos were truly her daughters, having been cloned from her eggs, which were harvested by <a href=\"/sublime/29-11330/\">Dr. Sublime</a> while she was in a coma following a Sentinel attack years before. Sublime cloned a thousand Cuckoos, in tanks hooked up to machinery. The original five were released to infiltrate the school and transmit information. Their origins were never questioned due to a strong telepathic block placed in everyone's minds which would cause their thoughts to redirect whenever they questioned where the Cuckoos came from.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134071\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Weapon XIV\"><img id=\"134071\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134071-72981-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Weapon XIV\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Weapon XIV</div></div></div></div><p>Dr. Sublime intended the remaining Cuckoos to return and join their \"sisters\". The true purpose of the Thousand-In-One (called Weapon XIV) was to combine their minds into one immense psychic weapon and telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. By assimilating the original Cuckoos into the one, Sublime would be able to control the power of the Phoenix through his control of the Thousand-In-One. It was then revealed that every Cuckoo could also turn into a diamond form, but unlike Emma, their diamond forms were flawless. He could then use the Thousand to split the Phoenix between all of them and trap it within their diamond bodies, thus giving him further control. Mindee willingly chose to re-assimilate, but Phoebe attempted to fight her way out. The X-Men attempted to destroy Sublime. When the X-Men severed Sublime's control of the Thousand and deactivated all the Cuckoos' nano-technology (including the original three), each individual clone awoke with their own consciousness and reached out to their sisters and mother.</p><p>It was revealed that Celeste was chosen as the primary host for the Phoenix because it heard Celeste \"call\" to her, as Celeste longed to feel, to live, and to burn with life. Emma reached out to a fearful Celeste and told her that her methods of teaching - trying to make the girls cold and emotionless as a means of protecting them - was flawed and that she hoped the girls would live with passion. She then gave Celeste the confidence to do \"what was right\" with the Phoenix Force and for her sisters.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"249689\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Three-in-one\"><img id=\"249689\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/249689-199568-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Three-in-one\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Three-in-one</div></div></div></div><p>However, to Emma's horror, the Phoenix used Celeste to destroy every \"sister\" of the Weapon XIV and the revived Sophie and Esme in order to end their threat against mutant-kind. The only ones spared were Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe. During the aftermath, Celeste begged the Phoenix to leave her as what it had forced her to do was too much. The Phoenix decided it wanted to stay with Celeste, so to stop it, Celeste divided her into three, and each remaining Cuckoo turned her heart into flawless organic diamond. Doing so trapped the Phoenix within them so that it could no longer wreak havoc. Unfortunately, this also caused the Cuckoos to lose their emotions forever. Thus, the Cuckoos - especially Celeste, who longed to truly live, grow, and love - sacrificed their ability to ever do so for the sake of maintaining peace. In truth, the Phoenix they encountered was merely a shard of the true Phoenix, having been shattered into billions of pieces at the end of <i>X-Men: Phoenix Endsong</i>. Despite this, that shard remained divided in three and sealed within Celeste, Mindee, and Phoebe.</p><p>These events devastated Emma, whose thousands of cloned daughters had each just begun to reach out for her with their minds when the Phoenix chose to destroy them. Emma then vowed that the Phoenix would have to contend with her if it ever returned, be it cosmic entity or in the form of Jean Grey.</p><h3>Quest for Magik</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b> <a href=\"/quest-for-magik/39-47186/\">Quest for Magik</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"303941\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"303941\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/303941-178596-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The Cuckoos helped Elixir to master biological manipulation by taking all biological and medical information from <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast's</a> head and duplicating it in <a href=\"/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir's</a> mind. Along with the other students, they were captured by <a href=\"/belasco/29-10947/\">Belasco</a> and sent to <a href=\"/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> as he searched for <a href=\"/illyana-rasputin/29-71216/\">Illyana Rasputin</a>.

In doing so, they learned that Belasco loved Illyana, but was only able to revive her soulless body, Darkchild, her soul lost and unreachable. After the defeat of Belasco by <a href=\"/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie</a> and Darkchild, the Cuckoos and the other students returned to the Institute, which reverted as if nothing had occurred.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><p><b>For further detail see:</b> <a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a></p><p>The Cuckoos helped the X-Men to find a <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">baby mutant</a>, the first post-Decimation mutant child born.

They remained loyal to Cyclops kept their own silence on the subject of X-Force.</p><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull's</a> invasion on Earth, the Cuckoos helped defend San Francisco from the Skrulls. When the Skrulls created a psychic blockade, it rendered every telepath useless and attempting to use their powers hurt them psychically. They soon channeled their powers to Emma Frost with the help of Cerebra, in the hopes that Frost would find and destroy the psychic blockade. Emma's psyche was temporarily disconnected from her body as she fought off the psychic Skrulls. The Cuckoos followed Cyclops' orders and used their telepathy to keep Emma's autonomic functions going, thereby animating her empty body. Emma finally destroyed the blockade, allowing the girls to use their telepathy again.</p><h3>Nation X</h3><p><b>For further detail see</b>: <a href=\"/nation-x/39-55961/\">Nation X</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1039279\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36512/1039279-cuckoos_517_super.png\" title=\"The Phoenix Fragments Leaving\"><img id=\"1039279\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36512/1039279-cuckoos_517_medium.png\" alt=\"The Phoenix Fragments Leaving\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Phoenix Fragments Leaving</div></div></div></div><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scalphunter/29-9734/\">Scalphunter</a> sent a group of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a> to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopia/34-56536/\">Utopia</a>, the X-Men were forced to battle the mutant-eating creatures. The Cuckoos served as a means of telepathic communication for the team, but during the battle, the Phoenix fragments that were contained inside their diamond hearts left them. It mysteriously returned to space, leaving the girls unconscious.</p><p>Once the Stepford Cuckoos woke up from their comma, they began scanning for the Phoenix. Since they couldn't find any trace of the psychic entity, they asked <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> to take some of their power so they could try passive scanning, as Mindee believed that since the Phoenix could bend active psychic probes the same way a black hole does with light. They explained to Rogue that she wouldn't just get the power, she'd get the perspective as well, the perspective of triangulating on peoples mind. When Rogue finished with the Cuckoos powers, they said that the silence of little or no telepathy could be deafening. They also told Scott that they didn't find anything on Cerebra. He then asked her if they had gotten a trace of the Phoenix when it left them, and they replied that it got further and further away without actually moving.</p><h2>Powers</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"747873\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3_super.jpg\" title=\"Psychic Gestalt\"><img id=\"747873\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/747873-worldwarhulkxmen002011dd3_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Psychic Gestalt\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Psychic Gestalt</div></div></div></div><p>The Stepford Cuckoos are powerful telepaths, who can combine their telepathic abilities to create an even more powerful hive-mind. Their telepathic powers include broadcasting and receiving thoughts, mind control, planting illusions, blasts of pure psionic energy, seeing through another person's eyes, and also are so powerful that they are one of the few people able to operate Cerebra. The Stepford Cuckoos are considered to be near Omega-level mutants, though they have never been classified as such, and since the deaths of their two sisters, have reduced in power.</p><p>In <i>X-Men: Phoenix Warsong</i>, they were the avatars of the Phoenix. During possession, they displayed new powers related to the Phoenix, such as Phoenix-granted telekinesis and fire generation. It is unlikely that they still possess these abilities, however, especially after their captured Phoenix fragments left them abruptly during the <i>Nation X</i> storyline. It should be noted that avatars of the Phoenix are normally only Omega-level mutants and that the Phoenix in question was merely a shard of the full Phoenix Force. Regardless of this, they are uniquely powerful telepaths and essential to the X-Men. Often, they maintain telepathic communication for the teams via Cerebra when Emma is occupied with other missions.</p><p>The Cuckoos have also inherited the ability to turn into organic diamond like their mother, Emma Frost. However, unlike Emma, their diamond forms are flawless, and cannot be shattered. Despite having this ability, the Cuckoos have never utilized it outside of the events of <i>Warsong</i>, where their hearts were transformed into a perfect diamond prison to capture the errant Phoenix shards. While the extent of their psychic powers while in full diamond form is unknown, they have been shown to telepathically communicate in this state, an ability that Emma does not share.</p><p>Alternate versions of the Cuckoos have also demonstrated the power of precognition. This may or may not be true for the Earth-616 Cuckoos.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-15104</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"216381\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\"><img id=\"216381\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8134/216381-11718-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Here Comes Tomorrow.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Here Comes Tomorrow.</div></div></div></div><p>The Stepford Cuckoos also exist on Earth-15104, known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/here-comes-tomorrow/39-41708/\">Here Comes Tomorrow</a>. In this reality, there were only three of them left - Celeste, Mindee and Phoebe - and they called themselves the Three-in-One. They also seem to have a self-destruct sequence within their consciousness, and this is the first reference to the sisters being Weapon XIV. The Three-In-One assisted the new team of X-Men in this apocalyptic future. When the Sublime-controlled Beast reawoke and controls Jean Grey as the Phoenix, they alert the others. Sensing that the crazed Phoenix will burn away their minds, they initiate a self-destruct sequence, committing suicide.</p><h3>Earth-58163</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1100246\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super_super.jpg\" title=\"House of M\"><img id=\"1100246\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1100246-80379_57075_stepford_cuckoos_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"House of M\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">House of M</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-58163, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>, all five Cuckoos were alive and well. Sophie still seemed to be the more dominant Cuckoo and still had the urge to be a heroine. When she found out that David and Nori were going to Japan to find Nori's father (who was labeled as a human terrorist by S.H.I.E.L.D, who were also looking for him, but to put an end to him), Sophie decided that she wanted to help them and left her sisters to go to Japan.</p><p>Sophie proved to be quite an asset to the team that went to Japan (which included Prodigy, Surge, Jubilee, Dust, Wallflower and Mercury). Even though most of the human terrorists were shielded from psionic attacks, Sophie still had enough power to manipulate some of their thoughts, and make them do as she commanded. She also helped the New Mutants in a premature face-off with the Hellions, and when Quill attacked Prodigy, she commanded Quill to surrender to her, which he did. She also was able to scan minds, which was how she learned that Wallflower was really working with the people of an experiment known as 'Project Genesis' which was what the New Mutants and the human terrorists wanted to shut down.</p><p>Wallflower quickly used her pheromones to make all the parties involved (New Mutants, Hellions and the human terrorists) hate each other so much that they would fight to the death. This brawl was ended by Mercury, who was immune to Wallflower's pheromone manipulation, when she killed Wallflower. Wind Dancer of the Hellions, cleared the pheromones in the air with her wind-manipulating powers, and Sophie, knowing that the pheromones only fueled hatred that was already there, started to use her psionics to strip the hatred so there would be no more fighting. Tragically, Sophie was gunned down by a human terrorist who was immune to her psionic manipulation, as she was trying to make peace, but the gunman refused to be at peace with mutant-kind and wanted to fight them.</p><h3>Earth-91172</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"187948\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men: The End\"><img id=\"187948\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/187948-33144-stepford-cuckoos_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: The End\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men: The End</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-91172, a world ravaged by the Hulk, three of the Cuckoos are alive.

The team's first recorded adventure is cleaning up the complete destruction of bar caused by a fight between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/turk/29-9039/\">Turk</a>.</p>\n<p>On John's first day at work, the team tackles rebuilding downtown Manhattan after a battle between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-knight/29-3172/\">Black Knight</a> and one of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tinkerer/29-3144/\">Tinkerer</a>'s robots. It's during this clean-up Damage Control construction worker, Rex Randolph, finds a cosmic artifact that turns him into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/edifice-rex/29-43354/\">Edifice Rex</a>.</p>\n<p>A test of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>'s latest weapon invention goes wrong and turns an entire building into glass and Damage Control is called to help out. It's revealed that Doom hasn't paid his bill in over six month and after some debate, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> is sent to collect on Doom's account. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> charges into Damage Control's offices demanding to speak to someone because his insurance had told him he was no longer covered because his policy only covered the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a> works this out by having <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> growl over the phone to the insurance company and once <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> pays his deductible, all is well. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> finds out that Albert went by himself to collect from Doom and he summons the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> to rescue him. Albert turns out to not need help as he gets <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> to write a check himself and uncovers an embezzling scheme in the process. Once the account is paid, Damage Control can deal with the glass house in the way only Damage Control can.</p>\n<p>Head of marketing, Henry Ackerdson, comes up with a new Image Enhancement program for the firm. It includes splashy, action-filled commercials featuring Fix-It Man, Fix-It Girl and Fluppy, the dog. His plan also includes uniforms for all employees and the drilling of a tunnel from Damage Control headquarters to their Warehouse in New Jersey. Ackerdson gives the tunnel digging crew from Stark Enterprises the wrong coordinates and sends them drilling under the Hudson river which causes the tunnel to start to flood. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> saves the day by placing a big metal plate at the bottom of the river to stop the flooding. The warehouse is destroyed however. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> cancels the Image Enhancement program and makes Henry clean up the mess where the warehouse used to be.</p>\n<p>As part of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inferno/39-41408/\">Inferno</a> event, Damage Control is asked by the county to investigate a series robberies of building supplies at construction sites and lumber yards and the team winds up at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> which is now a pile of rubble. Turns out some members of Damage Control had been there before to do some repair work and unwittingly unleashed a pack of robot clowns on the mansion. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> help round them up. Back in the present, the team learns that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a> is trying to rebuild the destroyed building and is responsible for the thefts. Damage Control shuts down the building's power and returns the stolen materials.</p><a></a>\n<h2>Round Two</h2>\n<p><b>\"After the earth-shattering conclusion...Once justice is served...When at the last possible moment, the world is again saved from the very brink of destruction...It's time to pick up the pieces...DAMAGE CONTROL!\"</b></p>\n<p>When we next see Damage Control it's smack in the middle of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/acts-of-vengeance/39-41931/\">Acts of Vengeance</a> storyline and the team is at the base of one of the support towers of the Brooklyn Bridge. The support has been destroyed and the only one keeping the whole bridge from tumbling to ruins is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> who's hoping DC can come up with a solution quick. Meanwhile back at Damage Control HQ, it is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a>'s last day and receptionist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne/29-43306/\">Anne</a> gives him a heck of a going away present. Elsewhere in the building, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> gets a phone call from President <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/george-bush/29-28108/\">George Bush</a> asking her to join the Commission On Superhuman Activities. She decides to take the job leaving <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin-chapel/29-43307/\">Robin Chapel</a> in charge of the business. Meanwhile, across the continent in Colorado, a prison break is in progress at The Vault and the escaping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a> finds their crowbar. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a> are sent to help out at The Vault after seeing to the repairs to the bridge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> goes to tell her business partners, Tony Stark and The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> about her new position and finds out they've sold their interests in the company to CarltonCo. Meanwhile at The Vault, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a> restore power and are promptly capture by The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderball/29-2253/\">Thunderball</a> recognizes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a> whom he met one day at the Damage Control offices and he convinces the rest of the Crew that they are not worth taking hostage. Soon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> arrives at The Vault to rescue our team and put the criminals back behind bars. Arriving back in New York, John and the rest of the team find out about the sale of Damage Control and find that CarltonCo has done a little work on the Damage Control Headquarters.</p>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a>'s trail of money leads the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> to Damage Control's newly redesigned headquarters. He busts in, guns drawn, only to be told to take a number and wait to be served. Using a robot of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> scares off the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a> gets Damage Control to retrieve the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-mansion/34-41036/\">Avengers Mansion</a> from underwater. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> discovers something strange in CarltonCo's reorganization plan for Damage Control and because of it <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> is fired. He vows revenge on Damage Control. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bart-rozum/29-43336/\">Bart Rozum</a> is promote to assistant and his first action is to hire a new intern in the form of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\">Robbie Baldwin</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> tracks <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin-chapel/29-43307/\">Robin Chapel</a> to her home but some quick thinking prevents him from causing any harm. Another part of the new business plan for Damage Control is not to honor the worker's negotiated contract which leads <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lenny-ballinger/29-43333/\">Lenny Ballinger</a> to call a strike!</p>\n<p>With Damage Control employees on strike, the destruction in the city is mounting. John and Robin try to figure out a solution. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rob-washington/29-43335/\">Rob Washington</a> is summed to a mysterious warehouse where he's offered a powerful battlesuit to extract his vengeance on the city in return for helping someone with their vengeance. Damage Control. John and Robin call in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> to help them repair buildings all over town. While fixing the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">Daily Bugle</a> building which had been knocked off it's foundation, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> is attacked by two men in battlesuits. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\">Robbie Baldwin</a> as Speedball comes to save the day and it is revealed that the mastermind behind the battlesuits is none other than <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a>. By the end of the day, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a> is in jail, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">Daily Bugle</a> is on it's side, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-mansion/34-41036/\">Avengers Mansion</a> is back underwate and the strike is still ongoing with no end in sight! <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin-chapel/29-43307/\">Robin Chapel</a> calls <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> for guidance, but is told she has other matters to discuss. When she hangs up we see <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a> is in a meeting with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/albert-cleary/29-43331/\">Albert Cleary</a> is plotting with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> to attempt a hostile takeover of Damage Control. Ray Lippert warns Robin and John that CarltonCo is willing to gut Damage Control to raise cash. Robin talks Lenny into getting the Damage Control crew to put off the strike for an afternoon to save some folks trapped in a collapsed building. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> arrives with a newly released <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-strausser/29-43334/\">Gene Strausser</a>, who it turns out used to work for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> and is truly sorry for the crimes he committed. Gene has an idea to stabilize the building from the inside. Meanwhile, Fury, Hoag and Cleary march into Mr. Souris' office to attempt the hostile takeover. Turns out Souris had used a loan from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> to purchase Damage Control. Cleary uses this information to make Souris agree to sell Damage Control back to Anne-Marie using money borrowed from Fury. Robin meets with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> to inform him that his dealings with Damage Control are now over. Hoag restores all Damage Control employees pay raises and the strike is over and the people in the collapsing building are saved. To wrap up the day, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-porter/29-43330/\">John Porter</a> restores Damage Control headquarters to it's original form.

        "description":"<h2><b>Origin</b></h2>\n<h3>Queen</h3>The Brood's civilization is based on insect societies such as the bees or ants consisting of a Hive-like lair. All Brood civilizations share strong telepathic bonds with their Queens, thus predicting no rebellions occurring against the Queens. The Broodlings do all the work and have an undying allegiance to their Queen, however each Queen do not share in a common interest. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3>Subspecies</h3>There are a few different types of Brood. Starting with the Broodlings who are brown in color and have known to have transparent wings. Next up is the Queen, which is also brown in colour and have no wings. They give out the orders to the Broodlings to fulfill. The second last are referred to as \"the Pure-Borns\", they are the firstborn offspring which have had no exposure to other races, they are green in color and rather large. <br />&nbsp;<br />Lastly, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood-empress/29-42767/\">  Empress Brood </a>which is also green in colour and extremely large, they are the supreme rulers of the Brood. Recently <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phyla/29-40922/\">  Phyla-Vell </a>(the new Quasar) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">  Moondragon </a>encountered and fought a newly discovered strain of the Brood species above the planet Dlaw-Neurg&nbsp;during the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilation-conquest/39-44982/\">  Annihilation: Conquest</a>. Unlike its brethren the Brood had no eyes, a brown-colored heavily armored exoskeleton and&nbsp;silver-colored wings.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The Brood also&nbsp;possessed the ability to&nbsp;breath in space and was at the very least three times the size of a full-grown Brood Empress. The creature, as far as anyone can tell, was&nbsp;little more than a feral beast and was not raised in a Hive-mind culture like its cousins. Moondragon later deducted that the Brood (along with&nbsp;a sand-dwelling&nbsp;member of a previously undiscovered gargantuan insectoid&nbsp;species) were the guardians of a deserted palace&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-warlock/29-6805/\">  Adam Warlock </a>once lived in&nbsp;sitting in the sand dunes of Dlaw-Neurg and therefore were not actually natives of Dlaw-Neurg leaving the Brood's true origins open to speculation. <br />&nbsp;<br />Recently, an unknown alien adversary of Kitty Pryde secretly infected her with an airborne virus that impregnated her with a microscopic Brood egg-sac, which made her body grow into that of a pregnant woman in her ninth month within a span of a few hours. It should be noted that these micro-Brood have been engineered to grow by consuming every last cell of their host from the inside-out and therefore must be removed before the Brood have a chance to grow out of control.<br />&nbsp;<h2>Creation<br /></h2>The Brood was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">  Chris Claremont</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\">  Dave Cockrum</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-wiacek/26-3271/\">  Bob Wiacek</a> in 1982 and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">  Uncanny X-Men</a> # 155.<br />\n<h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Brood Saga  </h3>Xavier and the X-Men are on a Shi'ar spaceship led by Lord Samedar and Araki. They tell the X-Men about Lilandra's kidnapping and their plan to invade Earth.&nbsp; The X-Men are opposed of course, so they head back to Earth and get Jarvis and Tigra to help.&nbsp; Deathbird and the Brood attack Corsair and Storm.&nbsp; The rest of the X-Men arrive to help them defeat the Brood, but Deathbird escapes and holds Xavier against his will. <br />&nbsp;<br />All of the X-Men were infected by the Brood, except Carol Danvers.&nbsp; Wolverine's healing factor saved himself by purging the virus.&nbsp; He saved the rest of the X-Men except for Fang who became a Brood Warrior.&nbsp; While the X-Men leave, the Brood Queen realizes this and instructs the Queen embryo inside Cyclops to stop them.&nbsp; They find a dead Acanti prophet and recover the \"Soul\" inside of a crystalline object in his brain.&nbsp; The Brood find the X-Men and defeat them while they mutate into the Brood themselves.&nbsp; The Soul starts to get corrupted as well, and Wolverine tries to stop his teammates.&nbsp; Carol arrives and has a new appearance due to the Brood experimenting on her, and she releases the Soul.&nbsp; It cures the X-Men, crystallizes the Brood Queen, and destroys the Broodworld.&nbsp; X-Men, Lilandra and Lockheed escape, as well as some of the Brood escaping from the exploding planet.<br /><br /><h3>Age of Apocalypse &nbsp;</h3>\n<p>In this reality, the Brood possessed the Shi'ar who later encounter the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">  Starjammers </a>which included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">  Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">  Havok's</a>&nbsp;father,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsair/29-7591/\">  Christopher Summers</a>. He ends up getting infected by the Brood. He later crashes on Earth and is later kept captive by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">  Mr. Sinister</a>. Christopher Summers later escapes the lab and meets up with his lost sons only to end up losing control to the Brood inside of him. He is then killed. In this reality another character infected was: <a href=\"/colleen-wing/29-1494/\"> Colleen Wing</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h3>Annihilation: Conquest<br /></h3><p>Annihilus and the Annihilation Wave (a race of insects) led an invasion and destroyed nearly all of the Brood species.<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h3>Planet Hulk (and World War Hulk)<br /></h3><p>In Planet Saakar, the Brood arrive and their Queen decides to mate with Miek, an insect king.&nbsp; They discover that Miek betrayed the Hulk, and the Queen and Hulk retaliate against Miek.&nbsp; The Earth Hive (an omni-consciousness of insects) decided to use Humbug to make the Queen infertile and kill the hivelings growing inside Humbug<br /><br /></p><h3>Ultimate X-Men<br /></h3><p>The Brood in the Ultimate Verse are <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">  Danger Room </a>programs.

At his side were Dr. <a href=\"/dr-cornelius/29-9393/\">Abraham Cornelius</a>, Dr. <a href=\"/hines/29-15697/\">Carol Hines</a> and Dr. <a href=\"/dale-rice/29-71214/\">Dale Rice</a>. <a href=\"/sublime/29-11330/\">John Sublime</a>, the director of <a href=\"/weapon-plus/65-40591/\">Weapon Plus</a>, was always behind the scenes. Some of the work of Weapon X was based on the experiments detailed on the journals of Nazi scientist <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Nathan Essex</a>, which were obtained by Weapon Plus after the end of World War II. The Project's original test subjects were the members of <a href=\"/team-x/65-49826/\">Team X</a>, a covert ops CIA team (<a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>/Logan, <a href=\"/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>/Victor Creed, <a href=\"/maverick/29-8307/\">Maverick</a>/Christoph Nord, <a href=\"/silver-fox/29-15696/\">Silver Fox</a>/Kayla Silverfox, <a href=\"/mastodon/29-27460/\">Mastodon</a>, and <a href=\"/john-wraith/29-3205/\">Kestrel</a>/John Wraith).</p><p>The telepath <a href=\"/aldo-ferro/29-27417/\">Psi-Borg</a> (Aldo Ferro) was involved in the creation of the victims' memory implants, in exchange for being endowed with immortality. The test subjects were policed by an adaptive robot enforcer, called <a href=\"/shiva/29-15390/\">Shiva</a>, should any of the agents go rogue. What the Weapon X scientists did not foresee is that the experimentation on Wolverine would cause him to go on a murderous rampage, which allowed the escape of the other test subjects, and caused the deaths of the Professor and Dale Rice, among dozens of other members of Weapon X staff, both scientists and military.</p><h3>The Facility</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76155\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/76155-132004-x-23_super.jpg\" title=\"X-23\"><img id=\"76155\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/76155-132004-x-23_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-23\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-23</div></div></div></div><p>Weapon X was temporarily shut down, but eventually was reinstated.

Like Weapon X once did, the Facility has also branched off from the main Weapon X Program.</p><p>Later creations of The Facility, now under the direction of Dr. <a href=\"/adam-harkin/29-65447/\">Adam Harkins</a>, include <a href=\"/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a>.</p><h3>Department K</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"403097\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/403097-127489-deadpool_super.JPG\" title=\"Deadpool\"><img id=\"403097\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/403097-127489-deadpool_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Deadpool\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Deadpool</div></div></div></div><p>At some point, Weapon X branched off from Weapon Plus' control and was solely headed up by Canada's Department K. A new generation of agents were created: <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a>, <a href=\"/garrison-kane/29-26923/\">Garrison Kane</a> (who took on the moniker \"Weapon X\"), <a href=\"/slayback/29-26752/\">Slayback</a>, <a href=\"/sluggo/29-15610/\">Sluggo</a>, and <a href=\"/ajax/29-20609/\">Ajax</a>, among others. Weapon X used Logan's DNA in order to endow its agents with healing powers. The batch produced many additional failures, which were sent to a facility for dissection to determine the cause of their failures.</p><p>These rejects were freed by <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> when he escaped from the facility. A smaller experiment was later developed by Department K with a New Zealand terrorist, who would become the third individual to be known as Weapon X, merging him with a symbiotic bacteria colony.</p><h3>New Weapon X</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79465\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/79465-81749-the-director_super.jpg\" title=\"The Director\"><img id=\"79465\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/79465-81749-the-director_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Director\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Director</div></div></div></div><p>Director <a href=\"/the-director/29-15621/\">Malcolm Colcord</a> forms the third version of the Weapon X Project, designed to monitor and eliminate mutants. <a href=\"/the-director/29-15621/\">Colcord</a>, once a security guard at the first Weapon X project, suffered severe facial lacerations during an escape attempt by the mutant Wolverine. Unlike the previous two installments of Weapon X, the third Project was completely U.S.-based and focused not only on the creation of living weapons, but also on the ultimate goal of Colcord, the creation of death camps. The Director initially uses Weapon X as his personal strike force to exact revenge against Wolverine. He soon begins utilizing its resources for the capturing and imprisonment of mutants in the secret government death camp called <a href=\"/neverland/34-55994/\">Neverland</a>. Mutants who are not suitable to be used as military weapons would be executed, while those that are suitable are given the choice to join Weapon X or die. A number of mutants, such as <a href=\"/cecilia-reyes/29-14177/\">Cecilia Reyes</a>, <a href=\"/maggott/29-15072/\">Maggott</a>, <a href=\"/ape/29-13368/\">Ape</a>, <a href=\"/tar-baby/29-14553/\">Tarbaby</a>, <a href=\"/leech/29-3193/\">Leech</a> and many others were arrested by Weapon X's agents and sent to Neverland. Those mutants deemed useless to the project were killed in gas chambers, while others were brainwashed to become Weapon X operatives. The organs of the executed prisoners were then sent to the <a href=\"/u-men/65-47994/\">U-Men</a>. The agents of the third Weapon X were <a href=\"/agent-brent-jackson/29-15622/\">Agent Brent Jackson</a> a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent; Sabretooth, who was given new adamantium implants; the shapeshifter <a href=\"/copycat/29-13311/\">Copycat</a>, Deadpool, and <a href=\"/mauvais/29-15624/\">Mauvais</a>.</p><p>Later on, Deadpool went rogue and new operatives were recruited into Weapon X, many of whom had their powers enhanced or were brainwashed into servitude. Maverick was saved from certain death and his powers were enhanced with the purpose of assassinating Wolverine, thus Agent Zero was created. Former member of <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a> <a href=\"/wild-child/29-9476/\">Wildchild</a> was brainwashed and further mutated into a Nosferatu-like feral humanoid. Former mutant terrorist Marrow had her powers set to a controllable level, restoring the young woman's natural beauty. <a href=\"/sauron/29-3180/\">Sauron</a>'s personality was merged with that of his Karl Lykos self and his energy-draining powers enhanced so he could fire energy blasts. Garrison Kane was further transformed into a cybernetic being. Aurora was kidnapped and brainwashed, like <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/29-24399/\">Madison Jeffries</a>, who was extracted from the terrorist group known as the Zodiac and used to create hundreds of Boxbots loyal to Weapon X to serve as guards at Neverland. Washout had his powers enhanced, though at a heavy cost. Each usage of his powers endangered his life and eventually, he dies trying to kill Colcord. <a href=\"/mesmero/29-5065/\">Mesmero</a> joins willingly, while <a href=\"/reaper/29-10317/\">Reaper</a> and <a href=\"/wildside/29-14842/\">Wildside</a>, former members of the Mutant Liberation Front, became agents of the program in exchange for their lives. The psychic mutant Jack-in-the-Box joins after his legs and arms were amputated. He becomes a living polygraph.</p><p>Unbeknown to all, except Sabretooth, Mister Sinister was disguised as the head scientist at the Neverland facility, Doctor Robert Windsor. As Windsor, Sinister supposedly helped some mutants escape from Neverland, but he was only taking them to his own secret labs. After some time, Brent Jackson, the only human officially on the team, took over as Director, during a mutiny by the team in conjunction with an attack by mutants from the Underground. Cable led this group, in a mission to destroy Weapon X and expose its existence and its human rights violations. Washout and Garrison Kane died in the event, while Sabretooth was washed away into the sewers after a battle with Marrow. Marrow used the battle to escape from Weapon X, eventually taking over the Mutant Underground, now reformed as the third incarnation of Gene Nation. Colcord fled Weapon X, with the always loyal Jeffries, and Aurora as well. Director Brent Jackson's team consisted of Wildchild, Sauron, Agent Zero, Mesmero, Jack-in-the-Box, and newly recruited Chamber, whose face was restored by the program's scientists.</p><p>Chamber was originally a double agent working for the X-Men, but was subsequently brainwashed into Jackson's service. Mister Sinister, under the alias of Dr. Windsor, remains at Weapon X. At some point, Jackson's team fought with Colcord's Boxbots. Colcord regains control of Weapon X. A person claiming to be Chamber has joined a superhero team known as Excelsior, but that person turned out to be an impostor. Following M-Day, both Chamber and Mesmero are rendered powerless. Neverland is shut down and the prisoners, either powered or depowered, are executed by hosts of Boxbots. Records of the massive executions are discovered by Beast in the Endangered Species storyline, which also hints that some of the bodies of the prisoners executed prior to M-Day were sent to Ord and used in the research to develop the cure for mutation.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse</h3><p>Logan uses the name Weapon X instead of Wolverine. Additionally, Deadpool didn't receive his healing factor from Weapon X, but from Apocalypse.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>An incredibly brilliant but unorthodox young scientific researcher, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-chief/29-35126/\">Niles Caulder</a> accepted the aid of a mystery benefactor in financing his biological experiments. His curiosity led him to investigate this unknown philanthropist, only to discover himself to be a pawn of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/general-immortus/29-25155/\">General Immortus</a> , a criminal mastermind striving to recreate an immortality elixir that had kept him alive for centuries. To guarantee Caulder's loyalty, Immortus had a bomb inserted in the scientist's chest which only Immortus could safely remove while Caulder lived. Caulder, however, tricked the General into shooting him, then, having reprogrammed his robot assistant, he had the mechanical surgeon operate to remove the bomb after he was clinically \"dead.\" The operation was only a partial success. Niles Caulder lived, but lost the use of his legs, becoming confined to a wheelchair. Destroying his lab and all his notes to prevent Immortus from discovering the secret he sought, Caulder seemingly vanished, and even the ancient overlord of crime could not find him.</p><p>Only after Niles Caulder's death would Immortus learn that, during his researches, the scientist had served as a Red Cross volunteer in India, where he met and later married a young woman named Arani, who became the first and only beneficiary of the Immortality serum. After going into hiding to escape Immortus, Caulder never returned to his new bride, fearing reprisals from his enemy. He surfaced only twice more before settling permanently in the brownstone combination laboratory/living quarters in Midway City that was to become the headquarters of the Doom Patrol.</p><p>First, he created a special radiation-proof fabric which was used to allow Larry Trainor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/negative-man/29-4087/\">Negative Man</a>, to walk the streets after he became permanently radioactive. Then, he became the first surgeon to transplant a human brain into a mechanical body when he saved <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robotman/29-4079/\">Cliff Steele</a>'s life by transforming him into Robotman. Finally, using the code-name \"The Chief\" to protect his real identity, he brought together Rita Farr, Larry Trainor, and Cliff Steele, and formed the team of adventurers whom the media dubbed \"the Doom Patrol.\"&nbsp;</p><h2>Creation&nbsp;</h2>The first appearance of the team was in My Greatest Adventure #80&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Team Evolution</h2>Throughout the publication history of the team, they have attempted to maintain the same edginess as the original team. &nbsp;This has meant that the membership of the team often reflects what is considered edgy in contemporary culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><br /><p>General Immortus quickly deduced the Chief's true identity and became one of the Doom Patrol's most persistent foes, but the general public remained unaware of the background of the red-bearded genius in the wheelchair until much later in the team's career.</p><p>Although Rita Farr was initially attracted to fellow teammate Negative Man, she eventually lost her heart to a self-aggrandizing billionaire named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mento/29-14647/\">Steve Dayton</a> who went so far as to adopt the super-hero identity Mento in order to impress her. After their marriage, Rita continued her association with the Doom Patrol despite Dayton's open antagonism towards them. Together, Steve and Rita adopted orphan Garfield Logan, the teen-age hero called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast-boy/29-3586/\">Beast Boy</a> (who would eventually become the New Titan known as Changeling).</p><p>After a series of adventures, the four original members were trapped on their island base by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madame-rouge/29-33038/\">Madame Rouge</a> and her ally, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-zahl/29-33039/\">Captain Zahl</a>, and given an ultimatum: either they would allow ZahI to blow up the island and destroy them, or he would detonate another bomb which would wipe out a fishing village of fourteen inhabitants. Heroes to the end, the Doom Patrol voted to sacrifice themselves, and Zahl triggered his explosive, seemingly killing the entire quartet.</p><br /><p>Two other regular characters in Doom Patrol, one who became a part-time member of the team and the other a non-member ally, lived on after the destruction of the original group. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast-boy/29-3586/\">Beast Boy</a>, later known as the Changeling, became a member of both \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/teen-titans-west/65-41546/\">Titans West</a>\" and the New <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/teen-titans/65-19081/\">Teen Titans</a>. Meanwhile, Steve Dayton continued to perfect his Mento helmet; Dayton vowed vengeance and spent much time and money in search of his wife's killers only to be captured by them. Several months after Dayton's disappearance, Gar Logan, now Changeling, asked Robotman to help him find Mento. The two old friends, plus Gar's new friends, the Teen Titans, rescued Mento from General Zahl and Madame Rouge; both villains died in the ensuing battle.</p><p>Robotman decided to forgo super-heroics and to mourn his friends, but was brought out of retirement by a new Doom Patrol organized by a woman claiming to be Caulder's widow. Steele joined their short-lived team until it disbanded, then went into service a third time when evidence was unearthed that led to the discovery of the still-living Negative Man. Eventually, Niles Caulder resurfaced as well and talked Steele into staying on as the core of the fourth incarnation of the Doom Patrol.</p><br /><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy-Prime</a> pounded on the vibrational barrier that once separated the multiverse, reality fractured and splintered. From its wake, a new Doom Patrol emerged in present day, seemingly wiping out the history of the first team. In this new reality, the wheelchair-bound Chief gathered Elasti-Girl, Robotman and Negative Man - who were soon joined by new members <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grunt/29-9043/\">Grunt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nudge/29-9044/\">Nudge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vortex/29-9045/\">Vortex</a>.</p><br /><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> struck, the members of the Doom Patrol - as well as Beast Boy - began to remember their original histories. When Beast Boy reunited with his foster mother, Rita Farr, time began to realign itself. The myriad histories of the Doom Patrol began to merge into a whole, combined history. As a result, The Doom Patrol's history was restored.</p><p>Former Titans <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bumblebee/29-3576/\">Bumblebee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vox/29-35124/\">Herald</a> joined the newest version of the Doom Patrol during the lost year after Infinite Crisis.</p><br /><p>Steve Dayton is again using the Mento helmet and he is mentally unstable; however, he remembers his time as the Crimelord. The Chief appears to be manipulating the Doom Patrol members once again; he claims to wish to return them to normal, so \"maybe one day they won't be freaks anymore.\" After the Doom Patrol encounters the Titans, the Chief tells them that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-devil/29-40528/\">Kid Devil</a> should be a member of the Doom Patrol instead of the Titans, since his unique appearance and nature will always separate him from others. However, Beast Boy, Elasti-Girl and Mento all stood up to the Chief and forced him to step down as the Doom Patrol's leader.</p><p>Another twist is that while fighting the Titans and the Doom Patrol, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-brain/29-31126/\">Brain</a> claimed that he had been the Chief's lab assistant, his body destroyed in an explosion Caulder caused and that he was to be Robotman.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3><b>Teen Titans</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1679243\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1679243-doom_patrol_super.jpg\" title=\"Doom Patrol in Teen Titans\"><img id=\"1679243\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80015/1679243-doom_patrol_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Doom Patrol in Teen Titans\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Doom Patrol in Teen Titans</div></div></div></div><p>The Doom Patrol made an appearance on the Teen Titans animated series' two-part episode \"Homecoming\".</p><p>The members that appeared were Negative Man, Robotman, Mento, and Elasti-Girl, this Doom Patrol was captured by the Brotherhood of Evil, with only Robotman free to save his comrades. After Robotman successfully sought out former Doom Patroller Beast Boy, he and the Teen Titans teamed up to rescue the Doom Patrol. In flashbacks to Beast Boy's Doom Patrol days, it is clear that Mento and Elasti-Girl play parental roles toward the young masked hero. When Beast Boy has to make the choice to defeat the Brotherhood of Evil or save his friends in both teams, he elects to save his friends, a decision denounced by Mento and lauded by the Titans. Mento acts in the series as the team leader, as their is no Chief on the team.</p><h3>Batman: The Brave and the Bold</h3><p>The Doom Patrol team up with [[Batman]] in the episode \"The Last Patrol\". In this series, the team is made up of Niles Caulder, Negative Man, Elasti-Girl, and Robotman.</p><p>A clip at the beginning of the show explain the history of the group and their popularity with the teens. After an incident with Captain Zahl at Paris, they end up breaking up. When the episode begins, the team has broken up and it's members are trying to live a normal life. Through out the episode, various <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/monsieur-mallah/29-11273/\">Monsieur Mallah</a>, Brain, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-animal-vegetable-mineral-man/29-38958/\">Animal-Mineral-Vegetable Man</a>, Arsenal, and Mutant Master attack members the Doom Patrol. Niles Caulder was first. Afterward, he and Batman teamed up to reunite the Doom Patrol.</p><p>However, it was all a ploy by Captain Zahl to get the team back together. He forces Niles Caulder to tell the world that he allowed a woman to be shot when he defeated Zahl at Paris. The Doom Patrol was then placed on an island rigged with explosives and given the choice to save their selves or an fourteen innocents on a similar island. They chose to sacrifice themselves. Batman tried to stop Zahl from activating the explosives, but was too late.</p><h3>Justice League: The New Frontier</h3><p>The Doom Patrol makes a cameo appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-the-new-frontier/223-86/\">Justice League: The New Frontier</a>.</p><h3><b>Film in progress</b></h3><p>Variety reported on July 19, 2006 that Warner Bros. has hired Adam Turner to pen a screenplay to bring Doom Patrol to the big screen.

They were there to rescue <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lucius-fox/29-3738/\">Lucius Fox</a> after he was taken by the evil <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baron-bedlam/29-30844/\">Baron Bedlam</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/geo-force/29-9544/\">Geo-Force</a> is the prince of the country and his father was recently killed by Bedlam. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/metamorpho/29-2384/\">Metamorpho</a> has travelled there to get help with his from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-jace/29-31374/\">Dr. Helga Jace</a> who was responsible for giving Geo-Force his own powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/katana/29-9547/\">Katana</a> is also there so she can kill Bedlam\u2019s military commander General Karnz who was in part responsible for the death of her children and husband. Batman also finds a young girl in the woods with amnesia with light based abilities. Batman decides to name the girl <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/halo/29-5694/\">Halo</a> and the group decides to stay together after teaming up to stop Bedlam. Some of the team\u2019s foes are <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-orange/29-32153/\">Agent Orange</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cryonic-man/29-31979/\">Cryonic Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/force-of-july/65-47155/\">Force of July</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/masters-of-disaster/65-31531/\">Masters of Disaster</a> ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-wave/29-19680/\">New Wave</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shakedown/29-9609/\">Shakedown</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/windfall/29-31287/\">Windfall</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heat-wave/29-7651/\">Heatwave</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/coldsnap/29-9607/\">Coldsnap</a>).

Emily Briggs is revealed in the comics and would soon become <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/looker/29-30843/\">Looker</a>. Halo\u2019s origin has also been revealed to the group and Geo-Force\u2019s lover <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/denise-howard/29-13123/\">Denise Howard</a> also showed up during this period.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Outsiders were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mike-w-barr/26-41455/\">Mike W.

Another year from then down to the month (November 2005) Captain Marvel Jr joined the team. The final member to join this team was <a href=\"/owen-mercer/29-7650/\">Boomerang</a> in <i>Outsiders</i> (vol. 4) #37 (April 2011).</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Without Batman</h3><p>Batman withholds the knowledge that Bedlam has been brought to life and retook Markovia with help from the Masters of Disaster and other Soviet forces. This angers the team and leads Batman to disbanding the group. However the team minus Batman travels to Markovia was they discover dead soldiers because of Bedlam. After beating Bedlam they discover he has cloned <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adolf-hitler/29-9671/\">Adolf Hitler</a> but the clone soon kills himself because of the horrors caused by his older self. The team is soon branded as Markovian agents who gain funding from the country and they soon move to L.A. in a new headquarters but Geo-Force leaves Denise and Looker and her husband are now separated. Batman only leaves for 1 year.</p><h3>Los Angeles</h3><p>The group also battles their foes the Forces of July again and the team also battle the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/duke-of-oil/29-4450/\">Duke of Oil</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peoples-heroes/65-47050/\">People\u2019s Heroes</a>, a group of Soviet supervillains.The team was also stranded on an island for three weeks, Geo-Force and Looker had an affair and he gives up his position as team leader on the island but the team is soon rescued. The Looker is soon followed by a detective who learns of her real identity and tries to blackmail her. However, she hypnotizes him and forces him to leave her alone but he was soon killed, Looker arrested for the crime and the team unable to clear her name of the charges.</p><h3>Return of Batman</h3><p>The team rejoins with Batman to battle <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eclipso/29-3763/\">Eclipso</a> and are given access to the L.A.

The team is taken prisoner but escape with help from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atomic-knight/29-30925/\">Atomic Knight</a> who joins the team. Dr. Jace dies when she was blown up along with Metamorpho. Looker also looses her powers after returning to the Abyssia when her powers came from and battled the Manhunters. Halo is also wounded saving Katanna and falls in a coma and is watched by Katanna. After these events Geo-Force has the team break up once again.</p><h3>Volume Two</h3><p>Markovia is taken over by a vampire-lord who has Geo-Force branded a traitor. He is forced to reform the Outsiders with new and old members to battle the threat. Looker is killed during the battle. The team is also blamed for the destruction of a Markovian village, sending them into hiding. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atomic-knight/29-30925/\">Atomic Knight</a> soon rejoins the team after tracking down the team to bring them in but is proved of their innocence. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/faust/29-11292/\">Faust</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/technocrat/29-47144/\">Technocrat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wylde/29-47145/\">Wylde</a> join the team. Halo and Technocrat\u2019s wife Marissa are killed while the group hides in Gotham City while fighting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/azrael/29-12834/\">Jean-Paul Valley</a> when he was acting as Batman. Luckily, Halo has taken over Marissa\u2019s body but this is causing Technocrat to have a hard time dealing with her death. The team soon finds that Looker is still alive but as a vampire and is soon freed from the control of the vampire-lord by her friends.</p><h3>Two Teams</h3><p>The team is soon split after the battle with the vampires. One composed of Geo-Force, Katana, Technocrat and Wylde, the other includes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eradicator/29-5377/\">Eradicator</a>, Looker, Halo and Faust and because of some of the things done by some of the new members are still fugitives. The teams also learn that Halo\u2019s original body has been reborn and is being used by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spectra/29-50697/\">Violet Harper</a>, the evil woman Halo originally controlled. The teams defeat <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kobra/65-55793/\">Kobra</a>, the group that recreated Halo\u2019s body and Harper (now calling herself Spectra with her own powers like Halo\u2019s) as well as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dervish/29-24927/\">Dervish</a> and Windfall. The teams also fight Faust\u2019s father <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/felix-faust/29-6593/\">Felix Faust</a> who tells Wylde to betray the team in return for being human again but is turned into a real bear and imprisoned in a zoo after they beat Felix.</p><h3>Nightwing's Outsiders</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"292418\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/292418-38024-outsiders_super.jpg\" title=\"Nightwing's team\"><img id=\"292418\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/292418-38024-outsiders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Nightwing's team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nightwing's team</div></div></div></div><p>A mysterious conglomerate known as Optitron offered to sponsor the Titans and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-justice/65-17733/\">Young Justice</a> after summoning them to San Francisco. Before any decisions could be made, a mysterious cybernetic girl (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/indigo/29-3408/\">Indigo</a>) from the future invaded the complex - and immediately engaged combat with both teams. With half the team out of commission, the remaining members tried to track down Indigo, but instead encountered a rogue <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> android which had been activated. The destructive robot caused the deaths of Titans <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donna-troy/29-4913/\">Troia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilith-clay/29-12525/\">Omen</a>. Indigo arrived and shut down the Superman android, leaving <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roy-harper/29-3404/\">Arsenal</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Nightwing</a> to mourn the fallen Troia.</p><p>Three months later, Arsenal assembled a new team of heroes and persuaded the reluctant Nightwing to join the team as well. Joined by the reformatted Indigo, Metamorpho (actually <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shift/29-3409/\">Shift</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jade/29-3406/\">Jade</a> and new heroes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunder/29-3407/\">Thunder</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grace-choi/29-3405/\">Grace</a>, the team vowed to proactively hunt down villains before they could strike. Nightwing dubbed this new team of heroes The Outsiders, in honor of his mentor's former team and said the team should track down criminals before they do anything wrong. Soon into the team's formation, Roy is injured, and to take his place as leader of the Outsiders was the Huntress. Helena didn't last long on the team, and quit as soon as Roy recovered</p><p>Nightwing's leadership began to falter, leading to a heated confrontation with Arsenal. Sensing a team in turmoil, Jade assumed leadership of the Outsiders and invited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfire/29-2389/\">Starfire</a> to join. After the team was utterly betrayed by Indigo who was revealed as Brainiac 8, Nightwing left the team. Seeking to bolster their ranks, Jade recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freddy-freeman/29-10935/\">Captain Marvel Jr.</a></p><h3>Leadership changes again</h3><p>During One Year Later Arsenal quits the team, giving the role of leadership to Nightwing. Later Nightwing decides he isn't the right person for the job, and quits as well.</p><h3>Auditions</h3><p>After Batman becomes the new leader of the Outsiders, he holds try-outs with the team present roster and possible newcomers. The first try-out is with Nightwing and Captain Boomerang; Nightwing quits the team because he doesn't approve Batman's methods and Boomerang leaves to be a part of the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/suicide-squad/65-40394/\">Suicide Squad</a>.</p><p>The second try-out is with Katana and Captain Marvel; Katana is chosen to be the first official member of the team, while Captain Marvel isn't chosen because he is too busy with the rock of eternity.</p><p>The third try-out is with Thunder and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a>; Martian Manhunter joins the team, while Thunder is kicked out.</p><p>The fourth tryout is with Metamorpho and the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a>; Metamorpho stays on the team, while Aquaman isn't accepted because Batman thinks that he can't match his predecessor.</p><p>The last try-out is with Grace and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">Wonder Woman</a>; Grace is accepted in the team and Batman later reveals that Wonder Woman was never a candidate for membership.</p><p>Batman and the Outsiders... Again</p><p>In November of 2007, DC relaunched \"Batman and the Outsiders\" with the roster Batman decided in the tryouts.Apparently, even tough <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunder/29-3407/\">Thunder</a> was kicked out and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a> wasn't accepted they both provided aid to the team. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/catwoman/29-1698/\">Catwoman</a> also joined the team after she heard some recruits saying it's\"down by law\", and said, \"Batman can't possibly start up his own crew of super-crooks without me in it!\" During their first battle Martian Manhunter was recovering information on information from their computers about <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brother-eye/29-51483/\">Brother Eye</a>. While Batman and Thunder were in Gotham Catwoman, Metamorpho and Katanna battled the OMAC. Grace showed up to help them, but Catwoman ran from the battle claiming it to not be in her league. Metamorpho transformed into a powerplug and after connecting himself to an outlet then the OMAC he stunned it with an electrical shock. He suggested that they keep it as a \"pet\" and Batman agreed believing a living OMAC is more useful than a dead one. Martian Manhunter left the group after that as he was there for mostly counsel. The issue ended with the team back at their apartment and having a talk about them needing more members and trying to keep Thunder when she was thrown through a window from outside by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batgirl/29-1701/\">Batgirl</a>(Cassandra Cain) saying she was invited.Eventually Batgirl and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-arrow/29-5936/\">Green Arrow</a> while <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/geo-force/29-9544/\">Geo-Force</a> rejoined as well.</p><h3>The Outsiders... Again</h3><p>After the 'death' of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> during <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a>, Batman's butler, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alfred/29-5556/\">Alfred</a>, finds a hidden chamber with a computer in it with Batman's last words for Alfred and other members of the Bat-Family. Alfred is asked to lead a new group of Outsiders that have certain characteristics of the Dark Knight since Batman is 'dead.' Alfred finds and recruits: Black Lightning, Halo, Katana, Geo-Force, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/creeper/29-5713/\">Creeper</a>, Metamorpho, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/owlman/29-59265/\">Owlman</a> (Roy Raymond, Jr.). Alfred tells these heroes that they need to cut ties with their old lives as now they will be in constant front line of battle and gives them the choice of not joining, which they all decline. This new team ran afoul of Deathstroke and a mysterious group of immortals called the Insiders who possessed a strange connection to Metamorpho.</p><p>Things quickly began to fall apart,Creeper quit the team when Metamorpho tried to reach out to him and BGeo-Force revealed that he had entered a non-aggression pact with New Krypton. Whilst foiling a robbery attempt by the newly reformed Masters Of Disaster, Black Lightning was forced to confront Geo-Force due to his increasingly erratic behavior, and the the two fought. After the battle, Geo-Force kicked Black Lightning as well as Metamorpho as well as Owlman to leave Markovia effectively splitting the team into 2 groups. Black Lightning's group was forced to turn to Simon Stagg in order to re-enter the U.S but were betrayed when Stagg used Metamorpho's body to power a new version of Chemo and turned his henchman Java into the newest Shaggy Man. Stagg was eventually defeated, Metamorpho was freed and the Outsiders gained a new member: Stagg's former bodyguard Freight Train.</p><p>Meanwhile, Geo-Force's team was just as busy, after quelling anti-Kryptonian riots in Markovia, Brion reformed Halo as a gift to Katana. Looker rejoined the tam after an encounter with the vampire hunter Stake and the team dealt with the invading forces of the Olympian as well as Geo-Force's ex-wife Denise Howard who had now mutated into an insane creature called Geode after trying to gain powers like Brion's. The situation with the Owlman was soon resolved and he joined the team as well. Tragedy struck again when the creature known as Doomsday attacked the team and brutally murdered the Eradicator.</p><p>Bruce Wayne was revealed to be alive and staged an attack on Geo-Force in order to evaluate the Outsiders worth to be involved in his future plans, a test they failed.</p><p>While visiting Black Lightning's daughter Thunder and her girlfriend Grace, The U.S based team was attacked by the JSA all-stars and Amanda Waller. Waller offered the team a deal :Defeat and apprehend the Markovia based team or go to jail. Black Lightning swiftly accepted and gathered his team (Thunder and Grace now among them) and traveled to Markovia.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p>In Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Black Lightning, Metamorpho and Katana are a group of teenage 'outsiders' that are influenced by <a href=\"/sleez/29-28454/\">Sleez</a> to attack society for considering them freaks. Batman and Wildcat defeat Sleez and convince the Outsiders that they can do better things with their abilities. <a href=\"/wildcat/29-7645/\">Wildcat</a> trains them to box and hone their skills to do good.</p>",

        "description":"<p>The Metal Men were created by <a href=\"/will-magnus/29-9536/\">Doctor Will Magnu</a><a href=\"/will-magnus/29-9536/\">s</a>, a young, successful, and inventive genius. By the time of the Metal Men's creation, Magnus had already amassed a personal fortune through patent royalties - much of which he reinvested in his research. The result of one of his projects was a robot made of platinum, female in form, whom Magnus nicknamed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/platinum/29-13685/\">Tina</a>.</p><p>Unlike conventional robots limited to certain programmed tasks, Tina was powered by a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/responsometer/18-55710/\">responsometer</a>, a nuclear powered microscopic activator. Not only did this device animate her body, but it endowed the robot with distinct and decidedly human intelligence and personality. It was due to the latter trait that Magnus decided to put Tina in the Science Museum; his activator was too perfect and Tina, to his mind, too much of an annoyance.</p><p>Before Doc Magnus could attend that chore, he was alerted to the menace of a monstrous prehistoric winged creation recently released from its glacial resting place. To combat this radioactive menace, Magnus created an entire team of responsometer- powered robots, each forged from a different metal, each with its own unique strengths. These robots he dubbed his Metal Men.</p><p>Like Tina before them, each of the new robots possesses very individual personality traits. Intelligent and analytical, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gold/29-13683/\">Gold</a> is the team's acknowledged leader. His golden form has all the physical properties of the metal from which he has been forged: he can stretch into a thin wire miles long, or flatten into a sheet 4 millionths of an inch thick.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lead/29-12702/\">Lead</a> is rather slow, but big hearted and reliable.

Good natured and friendly, he is the group's powerhouse. He is able to be shaped and formed into an infinite variety of objects to assist the team in its missions.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mercury/29-13682/\">Mercury</a> is proud, egotistical, and fond of telling anyone who will listen that he is the only metal that is a liquid at room temperature.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tin/29-13684/\">Tin</a> is the smallest and weakest of the Metal Men, though he is possibly the bravest soul, and is always willing to risk his existence to aid anyone in danger. As a result of his feeling inadequate, Tin stutters, although this impediment often vanishes in the heat of battle.</p><p>A further unofficial member of the team was \"<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nameless/29-37305/\">Nameless</a>\", a robot built by Tin. Shy and withdrawn, Nameless was Tin's \"girlfriend\" until her destruction in battle.</p><p>In the course of their career, the Metal Men have fought a variety of foes, most of them robots created for evil. Perhaps their most unusual and deadliest for is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chemo/29-10004/\">Chemo</a> - a walking stew of chemical waste in gigantic humanoid form, mindless and bent on destruction.

However, the strain proved too much for him and he had a nervous breakdown.</p><p>While Magnus recovered, the Metal Men continued to fight as a team. When he was fully back to himself, Magnus rebuilt the body of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robotman/29-4079/\">Robotman</a>, the only survivor of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doom-patrol/65-5701/\">Doom Patrol</a> at that time.</p><p>More recently, Magnus has returned to the Metal Men and they continue to embark upon new adventures.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Imperial Guard was formed centuries ago when a man named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rookshir/29-64892/\">Rook'Shir</a>, who wielded the power of the phoenix in his blade, was ravaging the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar-empire/34-23199/\">Shi'ar Empire</a>. They ultimately defeated him and hunted down his descendants, as they are the only ones able to wield the blade.</p><p>Its members are drawn both from the Shi'ar and other alien races governed by the Shi'ar. The majority of the Imperial Guard's members are known as Borderers. They assist the governors of conquered planets in enforcing the Shi'ar imperial law.</p><p>The Imperial Guardsmen however belong to the elite corps that protects the ruler of the empire, known as the Majestor or Majestrix, and executes his or her orders. The praetor (leader) of this elite corps is <a href=\"/gladiator/29-4653/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gladiator</a>, the most powerful member of the entire Imperial Guard.</p><p>The duty of the Imperial Guard is to serve the monarch of the Shi'ar, no matter who it may be. The Guardsmen once aided the mad emperor D'Ken against his rebellious sister <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a>, but when Lilandra succeeded D'Ken as ruler, the Guard switched their loyalty to her.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Imperial Guard was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a>, <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\">Dave Cockrum</a> and <a href=\"/daniel-dan-green/26-12171/\">Dan Green</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a href=\"/x-men/49-2133/\">X-Men</a> # 107. Many of the characters that make up the Imperial Guard are in fact loosely based on many of the characters that make up DC Comics Legion of Superheroes. <a href=\"/scintilla/29-41010/\">Scintilla</a> for example bearing resemblance to <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/29-12835/\">Shrinking Violet</a>, <a href=\"/hobgoblin/29-26374/\">Hobgoblin</a> based on <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, <a href=\"/fang/29-6090/\">Fang</a> based on <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Timber Wolf</a>, and <a href=\"/astra/29-13339/\">Astra</a> based on <a href=\"/phantom-girl/29-1257/\">Phantom Girl</a>, among many other parallels.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Guard Shattered</h3><p>During a fight with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vulcan/29-21233/\">Vulcan</a> the Imperial Guard suffered many casualties. Those who died in the fight were: Smasher, Hobgoblin, Cosmos, Neutron, Titan, and Impulse. Oracle and Nightshade were severely injured but they may have survived the battle. Gladiator, Scintilla, Manta, Earthquake, Mentor, and Flashfire survived the battle. Recently Vulcan formed a new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/praetorians/65-56912/\">Imperial Guard</a> using the five most dangerous criminals the Shi'ar Empire has ever captured. They are: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xenith/29-6140/\">Xenith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pnzo/29-59510/\">Pn'Zo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hodinn/29-59512/\">Hodinn</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/uncreated/29-14855/\">Uncreated</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zzzxx/29-59546/\">ZZZXX</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>The Shi'ar went to war with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a>, who were joined by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a>. In a battle between Vulcan and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, both seemed to be killed. In the aftermath, the Kree, lead by the Inhumans, were the victors. Gladiator became the new Majestor of the Shi'ar with the Inhumans as their overlords. A peace is trying to be formed between the Shi'ar and the Kree.</p><h3>Realm of Kings</h3><p>The Guard is originally dispatched to the planet Izumbardi, location of the production facilities for the Shi'ar Imperiums finest fleet. After the war with the Inumans, Izumbardi has become disheartened with the entire situation, and has decided to break off rather then remain under Shi'ar rule. This however is unacceptable to the Shi'ar, and as the apparent ruler of the planet is giving his declaration of independence, a scout reports to him that something is coming. It's the Imperial Guard, with guns blazing.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1005085\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1_super.jpg\" title=\"The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard\"><img id=\"1005085\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/1005085-prv3685_pg1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Imperial Guard assaults Imzumbard</div></div></div></div><p>But watching the Guard from a command center, Gladiator is finding it hard not to be out in the field again. He knows that as Majestor of the Imperium, he can't aid them in any sort of official capacity, as it would be frowned upon my members of the Shi'ar governing body. But old habits die hard, and as the guard is encountering some major resistance, it's Kallark the turns the tide and saves the day once again. Later as Kallark is receiving reports from the Shi'ar imperial flagship, one of his councilors berates him for taking such action, stating that it's a matter of image. Councilor Araki is dismissed, only to return to a room where the real councilor Araki is being held in a stasis field, as the imposter councilor reveals himself to be the infamous member of the Raptor Society, Talon. Later as the Guard are celebrating their victory, a small scuffle breaks out over whether Gladiator is actually the right person to lead the Imperium. But it's quickly interrupted by the new Praetor Mentor with a message that Gladiator requires them for a briefing, as they'd just volunteered themselves for a mission to the fault. And since the Imperiums fleet is stretched thin, Gladiator has acquired them a special transport team - <a href=\"/starjammers/65-14871/\">The Starjammers</a>.</p><p>At the fault, the Guard and the Starjammers are assaulted by a massive bio-organic ship, and consumed. The vessel is essentially helpless and as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chod/29-40789/\">Ch'od</a> and Mentor begin repairs on the ship, it's the Guards mission to defend it from alien microbes intent on beginning the digestion process of they're fleshy prison. As Fang, Manta, and Hussar are busy repairing the hull, the exploration team of Flashfire, the new Smasher, and Oracle are returning with enemies on their tail. They're saved as Flashfire returns to cook the microbes alive, and repairs are finished on the ship as they blast they're way out of the belly of the beast. But as they continue their exploration, they find drifting in space the Earth hero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>, badly damaged and running from none other then monsters of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-cancerverse/34-56640/\">Cancerverse</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1059062\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43353/1059062-ryut006_super.jpg\" title=\"The horrors of the Cancerverse\"><img id=\"1059062\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43353/1059062-ryut006_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The horrors of the Cancerverse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The horrors of the Cancerverse</div></div></div></div><p>Back on the throne world, Gladiator is saved by the figurative bell, as an attendant draws him from what looks to be an incredibly boring meeting. The M'Kraan Crystal is behaving strangely with power fluctuations, and as Gladiator approaches it, the quantum energies seem to recognize him. Gladiator touches the crystal is is given a mental communication from the Guardsman Oracle who's using Quasar to channel. The message is dire. There's danger at the fault, and the Guard is requesting massive assistance. But Oracle and Quasar can't hold the message for long, Gladiator wishes to go immediately, and even as the true Councilor Araki warns him about this decision, Gladiator can't stand to let his former comrades simply give up their lives in his service.</p><p>Meanwhile back at the Starjammers ship, the Guard is forming a wall of debris and Warstar is laying down a minefield for defense against the inhabitants of the Cancerverse coming to assault them. As the first of the defenses are tripped, Ch'od angrily messages Mentor. Someones sabotaged the ship by removing the Hypderdrive Capacitor. And the only suspect? The newest Smasher, who's on his first tour. As the members of the Guard and the Starjammers confront him, Plutonia grabs some amulets he had behind his back, and the new Smashers disguise is ruined. It's once again, Talon of the Society of Raptors. Talon says that he was only trying to help, and that if the amulets are returned, he can create two new raptors and boost the firepower of the Guard immensely.</p><p>Back outside, the Cancerverse inhabitants are attacking, but there's something oddly familiar about them. They all resemble members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>. A battle ensues, and the Cancerverse's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> manages to kill Starbolt. It's revealed that the attack is being orchestrated by the Cancerverses version of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Xavier</a> as some sort of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a> Ship. As things are looking dire for the guard outside, just as Neutron is about to be devoured, something bursts through one of the flesh ships and kills it. Gladiator had joined the battle, bringing along more members of the guard, and using the M'KRaan crystal to transport them all to the fault to aid the rest of the Guard. With Gladiators arrival, the tide of the battle is quickly beginning to shift, but unfortunately, the Guardman Neutron is also killed in battle. Gladiator arrives at the ship for the briefing and is informed of the situation. Like the others, he's incredibly unhappy with Talons presence, but Talon manages to convince them that he can help. He simply needs two volunteers to become Raptors temporarily. So Mentor and Plutonia volunteer, and together with Quasar, the Raptors, and Gladiator, they lead the assault on the inhabitants of the Cancerverse attacking them. When Gladiator feels it's time to withdraw and return to the Imperium, Quasar points out that the enemy seems to be falling back - on orders from the Xavier ship who lets out a massive psychic attack. The Starjammers manage to destroy it, and return to the Imperium. Later, Kallark reports to the Inhuman queen <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a> to explain about what happened at the fault. He warns them of what's coming, and everyone agrees that now more then ever, the Kree and the Shi'ar must be allies.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth 295 - Age of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1770404\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa_super.jpg\" title=\"AOA\"><img id=\"1770404\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1770404-imperial_guard_aoa_medium.jpg\" alt=\"AOA\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">AOA</div></div></div></div><p>After the mentally imbalanced son of Charles Xavier travels back in time, to kill Magneto, he unwittingly creates a new reality in which Apocalypse rules the Earth.

He did not change his ways he just stopped dressing in the costumes. He would change his mind shortly after when <a href=\"/doctor-alchemy/29-19089/\">Dr. Alchemy </a>paid him to attack Kord industries. Alchemy wanted them to be a distraction while he stole promethium that was being kept at the company. Farley agreed to the terms and was subsequently arrested for his troubles.

They also had their faces and hair painted in different colors.  Each ganger basically wore the same costume but had a different colored face and hair.  They also all wore facial hair in the form of a foo-man-choo.</p><h3>Farley Fleeter's Costume</h3> <p>Farley Fleeter's Costume is a camouflage like uniform with bright colors from all his gang membes uniforms.  He is also depicted with yellow hair and red face, gloves, boots and briefs.  Most of the time he is the only one with any facial hair.  He wear a long bushy foo-man-choo that he also colors yellow.</p><h3>The Madmen's Costumes</h3> <p>There are six other members of Fleeter's gang they are paired in three groups of two.  This is seen in their costumes.  The ganger in the yellow camouflage costume will have yellow boots, hair, gloves and briefs but his face will be purple.  While the purple ganger will be just the opposite with a yellow face.  It is the same for the blue and orange gangers and, the green and red gangers.</p>",

Fortune left the Gang, and they attempted to go on without him, but were stopped by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joker/29-1702/\">Joker's</a> manipulations. Later, while battling The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League</a> and their successors, the second Royal Flush Gang, the original Gang was killed.</p><h2>The Second Gang</h2><p>Started by Hector Hammond, the second Gang was the only one with full identities for nearly everyone. He changed the suit to spades and recruited new members:</p><p>*<strong>Ace</strong> (real name <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ace/29-28702/\">Derek Reston</a>) was an android with super-strength in the form of a man.</p><p>*<strong>King</strong> (real name <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king/29-19126/\">Joe Carny</a>) became immortal due to the metagene bomb and had the power of mind control.</p><p>*<strong>Queen</strong> (real name <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/queen/29-22284/\">Mona Taylor</a>) could create realistic illusions and had a wrist shooter that fired spades.</p><p>*<strong>Jack</strong> (real name unknown) had one real eye and one eye which was a laser weapon. He also had an energy-charged sword.</p><p>*<strong>Ten</strong> (real name <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ten/29-28701/\">Wanda Wayland</a>) had energy blasters in her gloves and carried explosive playing cards.</p><h2>Third Gang</h2><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-the-man-of-steel/49-4571/\">Superman: The Man of Steel</a>, the Royal Flush Gang had expanded all across America. Instead of only five members, each group had fifty-two, and four suits.</p><h2>Infinite Crisis Gang</h2><p>The Royal Flush Gang joined <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alex-luthor/29-24087/\">Alexander Luthor's</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-society-of-super-villains/65-40433/\">Secret Society of Super Villains</a>. The Joker, after being rejected from society, kills all fifty-two members of a Gang in a casino.</p><h2>Post-Crisis Gang</h2><p>In <i>Justice League of America</i> Vol. 2 # 35 a new version of the Royal Flush Gang appears This new gag works under Amos Fortune's authority, who is addressed as 'Wild Card' by his other members. He gives a history of the gang as it seems that he's combined the first and third gang's histories/characteristics, with Amos indicating that he was always running the group in some capacity.</p><p>There are multiple active, costumed members as some of them derive their outfits and code-names from with pip values lower than ten. Members can also raise in numerical ranks as a reward for their success, or be 'dealt out' at the discretion by their leader.</p><p>It's unclear if there are still 52 cells throughout the country, or that there are 52 members it total as a lower ranked member mentions that there are four Queens, but Amos states that the group is constantly growing.</p><p>The latest Royal Flush Gang has gone toe to toe with Zatanna when she took her show to Las Vegas. This gang has designed their motif to represent Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack for the exception of Queen. Jack looks alot like Sammy Davis Jr. but he calls himself \"The Candyman.\" King, of course, bears a striking resemblance to Frank Sinatra, the Chairman of the Board and Ace represents Sinatra's right hand man Dean Martin. Zatanna defeats the gang when she summons the neon lit cowboy on the Vegas Strip, to do her bidding. The cowboy grabs the gang and tosses each of them into a different corner of Vegas thereby knocking them out for the authorities.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3><b><u>The Gang in The Justice League</u></b></h3><p>In the animated TV series The Justice League, there is an episode (\"Wild Cards\") where in exchange for five super-powered kids' freedom from Government facilitating, the kids would become The Joker's Royal Flush Gang. Ten had invulnerability and super strength, Jack had an elastic body, Queen could manipulate metal, King could blast fire, and Ace, the most powerful, could create illusions and drive people insane just by looking at them.</p><h3><strong><u>The Gang in Justice League Unlimited</u></strong></h3><p>In the season 2 finale episode \"Epilogue,\" Amanda Waller recounts Bruce Wayne's final confrontation with the Royal Flush gang. This version of the Gang was lead by Ace, the illusion casting young girl from previous <em>Justice League</em> and <em>Batman and Robin: The Animated Series</em> episodes, who used her psychic abilities to wreak havoc on the city and imbue ordinary people with special abilities, making them her Royal Flush Gang. This version showed different versions of The Gang, all based on some sort of popular culture refference. <strong>King</strong> was a large floating head, much resembling Marvel's supervillain MODOK, a villainous creature created by Jack Kirby (often reffered to as \"the King of Comics\"), <strong>Queen</strong> was a man who had been transformed into a large, operatic, drag queen style woman with a powerful sceptre, <strong>Jack</strong> weilded a samurai sword and sported kabuki style makeup, resembling the then popular Cartoon Network Series character Samurai Jack, <strong>Ten</strong> was based on Bo Derek's iconic performance in the 1979 movie \"Ten,\" with prehensile braids that could be extended from her head. Once Batman convinced Ace to stop using her powers and return Metropolis to its former state before dying of an impending brain aneurysm, the Royal Flush Gang were returned to their former selves as well.</p><h3><b><u>The Gang in Batman Beyond</u></b></h3><p>The gang in this series was a family of thieves. <b>King</b> and <b>Queen</b> are married, and their children serve as <b>Jack</b> and <b>Ten</b>. The are also accompanied by a super strong android called <b>Ace</b>.</p><p>After the gang was arrested, a new Royal Flush Gang makes a sudden appearance on the Deuce's Wild Floating Casino. Terry was outnumbered and the the gang escapes but he did learn a few things that seemed out of place. This gang travelled without Ten, Ace's body seemed soft when Terry laid a few punches as if he were human rather than an android and the actual Royal Flush Gang was still in prison. Terry goes to the newly renovated Blackgate Penitentiary in order to find out if the Royal Flush Gang has found a way to sneak out of prison to conduct their crimes before their parole. Terry observes King and Queen having a private call with Melanie aka Ten, who is currently serving time in juvie. Melanie had heard about the copycat Royal Flush Gang and wanted know if her parents were behind it but King abruptly ends the call because he was still disappointed in her for her disobedience.</p><p>Bruce calls in Terry, telling him to quit the recon and to react to a break in at the No Trump Jewelry Store. Someone that looks like Ten is stealing the Broken Heart Diamond. Terry intercepts Ten's escape. She reacts by throwing sharp playing cards at Terry but Terry dodges them with a manhole which causes the cards to ricochet back at Ten. One card slits Ten's left cheek and Terry makes his way to apprehending her. As Terry gets close, Ten slips an electrical playing card that shocks Terry and Ten makes her escape. Terry destroys the card and heads to juvie hall where Ten is being held. Terry arrives to notice Ten walking as part of a chain gang back to her cell block. Terry also notices that Ten doesn't have scar on her left cheek.</p><p>Bruce figures out that King and Queen have twin siblings. Each King married a Queen but their offsprings turned out different. The original King and Queen had Melanie and Jack Walker while the copycat King and Queen only had one daughter that looked similar to Melanie. Both families had criminal tendencies and the copycat King shared a cell with two men that looked similar to Jack and Ace. Terry figures out what the copycat gang is up to. They were ridiculing the original gang in prison with their thefts and now the copycats will kill the original gang at their parole hearing.</p><p>Terry manages to save three members of the original gang and defeats the copycats but King screws up the parole hearing when he holds Batman as well as the parole board hostage. Fortunately, the gun that King held only responds to the fingerprint recognition of a prison guard. Terry detains the original gang and heads toward juvie hall. The guards at juvie hall try to break into Melanie's cell but it was locked from the inside. Terry uses his suit's super strength to kick down the door and begins to console Melanie becasue she has her copycat cousin kneeling on the floor. Melanie wants to bash in her cousin's head with a scepter for all the misery her uncle and aunt brought her family but Terry's words get through to her. Melanie drops the scepter and her cousin is apprehended.</p><p>The next day, Terry learns that the copycat gang are being processed for their crimes while the Walkers await the parole board's decision. The parole board deems the Walkers except for Melanie unfit for parole at this time. Melanie experiences mixed feelings. For instance, she is overjoyed to be released from juvie but she is saddened that her mother and brother will continue to be incarcerated at Blackgate because of King's actions. But most of all, she feels let down because as she looks back at the courtroom, she notices that Terry wasn't present at her hearing. However, Terry was there but Bruce convinced Terry to leave so there would be no second thoughts of rekindling a lost love affair.</p><p>After Jack was released from prison, Melanie got him a job at the restaurant where she worked at, as a dish washer but that didn't last for too long. Jack usurped his father's position as King and started a series of tryouts for local street punks who wanted to become the new founding members of the Royal Flush Gang. Terry tails one street punk named Gary that has just committed a burglary. Terry beats up Gary and leaves him for the police. The next day, Bruce gets intel from Barbara and relays it back to Terry. According to Barbara's interrogation, Gary was bragging about how his burglary was an initiation to become a member of the Royal Flush Gang.</p><p>Terry goes to Melanie for help and she agrees to end this nightmare once and for all. Melanie goes to visit King at Blackgate to learn about any hideouts that the gang used to meet at after Melanie was cast out of the gang. At first, King refuses to help Melanie and begins to taunt her about how rehabilitation has rewarded her as well as Jack. Melanie informs King that Jack has taken his position of power and is starting a new Royal Flush Gang. King becomes infuriated and tells Melanie everything.</p><p>Jack and his new Queen welcome the new members to their gang. Since the software in the Ace android was outdated, Jack initiated a techno savy midget named Chet who can control Ace by via remote control body suit. As for the new Jack, a street punk named Wyatt takes the position. As for Jack's new Queen and Ten, their identities remain unknown. However, its possible that Ten is Melanie's identical cousin who has also not been named while Queen maybe Sable Thorpe, King's replacement Queen who double crossed Paxton Powers during Bruce's attempted assassination. Suddenly, Melanie and Terry crash the party. Melanie expresses her disappointment in regards to Jack's relapse into crime but Jack tells her that he has no regrets. Terry and Melanie easily defeat the new gang while the police arrive to cart the gang off to Blackgate.</p><h3><u>The Gang in Batman: The Brave &amp; Bold</u></h3><p>In the opening scene of an episode called \"Return of the Fearsome Fangs\", the gang in this series are a gang of bandits in the Old West and fight Johan Hex. As Hex was caught and the Gang planning to tear him apart with scattering horses until Batman frees him and the two apprehend the Royal Flush Gang.</p><h3><u>Justice League Doom</u></h3><p>The Royal Flush Gang will making a brief appearance in the Animated DC Universe <a href=\"/justice-league-doom/223-1413/\">Justice League Doom</a>, which is based off of <a href=\"/jla-tower-of-babel/39-49895/\">Tower of Babel</a> and <a href=\"/justice/39-56112/\">Justice</a>.

The Guardians realized their failure with the Manhunters was due to their creation's single-mindedness, lack of emotion (such as fear and courage), and most importantly the absence of morality and honor in the androids. The Guardians chose to assign sentient beings that excelled in fearlessness and morality. These beings would then watch over their sector of the galaxy. The sector that includes Earth is Sector 2814. The mission of the Green Lantern Corps is to protect the galaxy from interstellar threats of all kinds, from individual planets' problems to forces threatening entire systems.</p><p>The origin of the Green Lantern as a symbol of justice is derived from the first accounts of a police force in the universe. The police force emerged within a foggy world, where the officers would carry a lantern lit by a green flame. This legend was symbolic of justice piercing through the darkness and uncertainty of the universe. The various symbols of the Green Lantern Corps reflect this legend. Originally the Green Lantern Corps wasn't as large as it is today. After an encounter and defeat at the hands of the embodiment of evil, <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a>, a Green Lantern urged the Guardians to recruit an army to repel this evil should it ever become necessary. This recruitment nearly doubled the Corps. Each member has a great deal of autonomy as to their methods in their jurisdiction, subject to review by the Guardians if they feel the Green Lantern in question has abused their assigned authority. The individual Lanterns are responsible for arranging their replacements (when possible) if they are near retirement or death. If a Lantern dies before that obligation is met, the ring will find and seek another to be trained on its own. In rare circumstances, Guardians will personally go out into the field to recruit a replacement.</p><p>Upon recruitment each Green Lantern in the original Corps received a Power Ring, a Power Battery shaped like a lantern (with which the ring is recharged), and a uniform. The default uniform design for humanoids was a green section covering the torso and shoulders, black arms and leggings, green boots, white gloves, green domino mask and a chest symbol of a stylized Green Lantern icon on a white circle. Lanterns were allowed to customize their uniforms as long as the color scheme and the symbol were present. When the nature of the being precludes a standard uniform, an equivalent arrangement is expected as a substitute. For instance, <a href=\"../../mogo/29-41919/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mogo</a>, a sentient planet, arranges his foliage to create a green circling band and lantern symbol on his body. <a href=\"../../jack-t-chance/29-45059/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack T. Chance</a>, a humanoid, refused to wear a uniform, but conceded to wearing a badge on the lapel of his coat. Lanterns were also allowed the option of a secret identity as a security measure and it is implied that the Corps were instructed to honor that choice by taking care not to expose them. Training in the use of the ring was optional and appropriate facilities and personnel were available on Oa upon request. In addition, a senior Lantern can be assigned to coach a recruit while in the field in their sector. The Corps was destroyed when Hal Jordan was possessed by <a href=\"../../parallax/29-41293/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parallax</a>. But it was rebuilt when Hal Jordan sacrificed himself to stop the <a href=\"../../sun-eater/29-47363/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun-Eater</a>.</p><h3>The Green Lantern Corps (Post-Final Night)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1857622\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/99507/1857622-1307864404.jpg\" title=\"Green Lantern Corps (Post-Final Night)\"><img id=\"1857622\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/99507/1857622-1307864404_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Green Lantern Corps (Post-Final Night)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Green Lantern Corps (Post-Final Night)</div></div></div></div><p>The new Green Lantern Corps being built by the Guardians is far more formal and structured than the old one that was destroyed by <a href=\"../../parallax/29-41293/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Parallax</a>. Recruits, after being found by their Power Rings, are taken to Oa for training. Not all recruits will make it through training - indeed a great many of them might even fail, forcing the ring to find another candidate. Lantern trainees have a simplified version of the old Green Lantern uniform (with green covering more of the torso) with the white circle on their chest blank, presumably until the Lantern insignia is added upon completion of their training. Additionally, all Power Rings, not just Kyle Rayner's ring, now work on the color yellow, provided the user can feel the fear behind the color and overcome it.</p><p>Each member is given a <a href=\"../../lantern-power-ring/18-41361/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lantern Power Ring</a>. The ring can perform whatever the wielder can imagine, so long as they have the willpower to channel and control the energies of the ring. There are no limits to what the ring can do, limited only by the wearers own fear and uncertainty. For this reason the ring is considered \"The Most Powerful Weapon in the Universe\". The power ring has its own intelligence and is able to understand the thoughts of the wearer. Though the ring itself is not sentient, if a Lantern is to ever die the ring is able to find a worthy successor. The ring does have a finite amount of energy before having to be recharged. Some Green Lanterns speak an oath to strengthen their will and reaffirm their determination during this time of recharge. The energy source of all this is fed by the Central Power Battery of Oa. If the Lantern dies with there ring the power tends to die out, but in the past it has been known that the Green Lantern spark never entirely dies out. When untied with another Lantern who has not passed away, the spark is recharged.</p><h3>In 30th Century (Silver Age)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2315199\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super.jpg\" title=\"Green Lantern Corps (30th Century - Silver Age)\"><img id=\"2315199\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2315199-343419-3033-22768-2-legion-of-super-hero_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Green Lantern Corps (30th Century - Silver Age)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Green Lantern Corps (30th Century - Silver Age)</div></div></div></div><p>In the latter part of the 30th Century, Green Lantern Corps have been forbidden into <span id=\"GingerWidget-correction-0\">interfering</span> with the U.P. planets, for some unknown reason.

This along with the belief that the Oans were restricting their potential, led the robots to rebel. The Oans quelled the rebellion and disbanded the Manhunters by destroying them, but a few survived. They still challenge the Guardians to this day with their severe brand of justice, and have made the Green Lantern Corps their mortal enemy.</p><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths</h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a></p><p>During Crisis on Infinite Earths the Guardians of the Universe leave Oa.

It is required that each sector have two Lanterns, but it can have more depending on the population of that sector. Also there is a reserve force on Oa. The specific arrangement of the <a href=\"../../3600-sectors-of-space/34-56427/\" rel=\"nofollow\">3600 sectors</a> has changed over the years. If the universe is viewed as a sphere (or oblate spheroid), the sectors were originally described as wedges of that sphere, each 1/10 of one degree wide. This effectively meant that each Lantern had a sector of infinite size, since the universe is theoretically infinite. Later, sectors were described as being of non-standard location and size. A large area of vacuum between galaxies might be one large sector, while a galaxy like the Milky Way may be comprised of several sectors. The latest description amends the original one - sectors are now a one-degree by eighteen-degree section of the sphere-shaped universe, with the origin points meeting at Oa, which is located at the center of the universe. While this still results in an infinitely-sized sector, is not as spread out. Since the sectors all meet and begin on Oa, this means that Oa is in every Lantern's sector, and while a Lantern is on Oa, he is technically still patrolling his home sector.</p><h2>Branches of the Corps</h2><h3>Green Lantern Honor Guard</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"315630\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15297/315630-23957_super.jpg\" title=\"Honor Guard\"><img id=\"315630\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15297/315630-23957_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Honor Guard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Honor Guard</div></div></div></div><p>The Honor Guard is a special force of elite Lanterns who have been chosen for their exemplary service or capabilities to serve full time on Oa. They, partially because Oa is technically in every sector, are not restricted to any one sector and serve as special operatives or troubleshooters for the corps. (One of Guy's assignments was to provide backup for Natu when her partner died). They also serve as commander\u2019s during combat situations, such as during the <a href=\"../../spider-guild/65-55986/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Guild</a> Assault. <a href=\"../../guy-gardner/29-1791/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Guy Gardner</a> was promoted to the Honor Guard, as Lantern 1 (Hal Jordan is lantern 2814.1) after his actions during that battle.

The members of the Corpse follow different rules than normal Lanterns, and in fact most don\u2019t even know of their existence. One example being that they were not bound by the use of Lethal Force even before the <a href=\"../../sinestro-corps-war/39-50650/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinestro Corps War</a>. (Gardner mentioned during a mission with them that he\u2019d never heard of the Corpse, and after the mission his memory of them was erased.) Not much is known about the Corpse, though what is known pertains simply to their duties. Members of the Corpse do not use power rings like most Lanterns; instead they are given coin-like disks which when swallowed give them all of the same abilities for a limited amount of time. The energy produced by these disks is purple, as opposed to the usual green (though it is unknown with the recent revelations about the Emotional Spectrum what this means). Corpsemen do not wear the traditional green of other Lanterns, and under no conditions do they dawn the symbol. They tend to instead wear black uniforms that have no symbols, appropriate for their station. With the recent authorization of Lethal Force against Sinestro Corps members and other enemies of the Lanterns after the war, the need for the continuation of the Corpse is in question by some. Though there will likely remain a need for those who work in the shadows.</p><h3><b>Alpha Lanterns</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"353591\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns_super.jpg\" title=\"No Lantern Escapes The Alpha Lanterns\"><img id=\"353591\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13181/353591-183072-alpha-lanterns_medium.jpg\" alt=\"No Lantern Escapes The Alpha Lanterns\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">No Lantern Escapes The Alpha Lanterns</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/alpha-lanterns/65-49719/\">Alpha Lanterns</a></p><p>After the Sinestro Corps War the Guardians create a new class of Green Lantern called the <a href=\"../../alpha-lanterns/65-49719/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Lanterns</a>.

They have \"the sentient drive and thought process of the Green Lanterns and the efficiency and logic of The Manhunters,\" as the Guardians turn them into cyborgs using Manhunter technology, and mainline their minds directly to The Book of Oa and the Central Battery. After the transformation, an Alpha Lantern would receive an additional power ring. Similarly to the most recent generation of Manhunters, Alpha Lanterns have a secondary face which can drain a Power Ring of its energy. The Alpha Lanterns tend to chant the Manhunter-like slogan \"No Lantern escapes the Alpha Lanterns\".</p><p><a href=\"../../laira/29-46403/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laira</a> was the first Green Lantern to be punished by the Alpha Lanterns; for the crime of killing <a href=\"../../amon-sur/29-42351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amon Sur</a> she was stripped of her powers and expelled from the Corps.At some point during Final Crisis, the Alpha Lantern Kraken is possessed by the spirit of the deceased New God, Granny Goodness, and manages to frame Hal Jordan for a murder he did not commit.

Norman Osborn joined&nbsp; the cult while hiding in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/europe/34-56099/\"> Europe</a> following his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-death-of-gwen-stacy/39-43220/\"> \"death\"</a> and eventually rose to the head of the organization&nbsp;after disposing of the cult's head&nbsp;Scrier. Still believed to be dead, Osborn used the Scrier cult&nbsp;as his personal eyes and ears for years, as well as his personal minions to further his own goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />It was&nbsp;Osborn who instructed a Scrier to bring tissue samples of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\"> Peter Parker </a>and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\"> Gwen Stacy </a>to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jackal/29-10974/\"> Miles Warren </a>in ordered to be cloned for&nbsp;Warren's own twisted ends, which Osborn would later use&nbsp;for his own purposes.&nbsp;Osborn also used a Scrier to befriend a mutant who could also alter people's perceptions named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/judas-traveller/29-15469/\"> Judas Traveller </a>so that Osborn could use Traveller as a pawn against Spider-Man and Ben Reilly, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-spider/29-6286/\"> Scarlet Spider</a>. &nbsp;Traveller was later betrayed by the majority of his<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/host/65-55972/\">  Host </a>and the Scrier; Traveller&nbsp;hasn't been seen since.&nbsp;After Miles Warren returned as the Jackal, Osborn instructed a Scrier to confront him to stop&nbsp;the Jackal's mad scheme to unleash his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carrion/29-14507/\"> Carrion</a> virus and replace the world's population with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clone/12-55828/\"> clones</a>. While unsuccessful, it did buy time for Spider-Man and the Scarlet Spider to stop him.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Following his return, Norman Osborn continued using the Scrier, including the procuring of an object of great interest from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alison-mongrain/29-15631/\"> Alison Mongrain</a>, which also brought them into direct confrontation with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kaine/29-8667/\"> Kaine</a>.

While this is often useful, as it allows them to communicate wordlessly and finish each others sentences, it is also a liability, as they feel each others pain during fights. Tomax and Xamot are mirror images of each other, except Xamot has a scar on the right side of his face. The twins run a corporation called <i>Extensive Enterprises</i> which is a legitimate business firm that masks their true criminal intent.

He was ordered to leave his friend behind, but he ignored the orders and rescued Snake Eyes, saving him from certain death. He brought Snake-Eyes into his clan; the two became sword brothers. He joined Cobra with the intention of finding the man who killed his uncle, the leader of his clan.

Commands for the Monsters are issued by Dr. Mindbender or Cyber-Vipers, but it\u2019s the skilled tactics of the Mega-Vipers who train and lead the Monsters on their attack missions.</li><li><b>Monstro-Vipers</b> \u2013 Monstro-Vipers were once members of the Cobra Range Vipers, until Cobra Commander demanded they \u201cvolunteer\u201d for an experiment in DNA alteration. The experiment was run by Dr. Mindbender who crossed the Vipers with the bio-genetics of rapid werewolves, giant \u201cBigfoot\u201d creatures, and the most vicious grizzly bears. The fusion process leaves them \u00bc man and \u00be beast, the most brutal beasts to ever roam the earth.</li><li><b>Neo Viper Commander</b> \u2013 He is the leader of the Neo-Viper forces, the troops that make up the backbone of the Cobra legions. Extremely mean, unquestionably loyal and willing to backstab anyone it takes to get ahead, he trains the Neo-Vipers in all forms of combat and has them ready to deploy immediately when needed. He is outfitted with techno-engineering to withstand all types of severe weather elements, same as all Neo-Viper troops.</li><li><a href=\"/neo-vipers/29-7721/\"><b>Neo Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Neo-Vipers are cold-blooded commandos whose mental states have been enhanced to change them into superhuman warriors. They are suited up in armored climate-controlled outfit, which allows them to function in extreme environments. They train in deep battle tactics, survival procedures, and high-tech weapon-systems management. They are aggressive, ferocious, sneaky, yet practical enough to know when to retreat tactically.</li><li><a href=\"/night-viper/29-63617/\"><b>Night Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Night Viper troops wear specialized gear for nighttime operations, such as a helmet that is a miracle of electronics-miniaturization. Their helmets have a wide-angle image intensifier, directional sound amplifier and passive infrared detector, assisting them in quickly locating enemies via sight and sound with immaculate accuracy. They wear customized synthetic composite suits to conceal them from radar and they are skilled and trained in perpetually dark environments.</li><li><a href=\"/saw-viper/29-63653/\"><b>S.A.W. Vipers</b></a> \u2013 The Cobra SAW Viper soldier is equipped with a gyro-stabilized, cryogenically cooled mini-chain gun with infrared night-vision auto-ranging optical sighting system. This means they have a highly accurate, low malfunctioning machine gun that can tear apart a target in heavy brush over 800 yards away in pitch black darkness.</li><li><a href=\"/sludge-viper/29-66859/\"><b>Sludge Viper</b></a> \u2013 The Sludge Viper never runs out of ammo, since his sludge gun has a built in decomposition accelerator which can create more toxic sludge out of whatever is readily available. The sludge gun propels the toxic sludge at lethal velocities with noxious methane gases. The gun also features a laser range finder, 3 gen image intensifier and phased magnetic array, sludge guidance system.</li><li><a href=\"/techno-viper/29-12210/\"><b>Techno-Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Techno Vipers are Cobras battlefield technicians. It is inevitable that the vehicles and machines used in these modern battles will break down and when they do it is the mission of the Techno-Vipers to provide field maintenance support and combat-engineer capability to the frontline Cobra troops. They maintain and operate Cobra Power Fighter units on the battlefield so they can help with the battle while out in the field until they are needed for technician duties.</li><li><a href=\"/tele-viper/29-7754/\"><b>Tele-Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Tele-Vipers are the communications gurus of the Cobra organization. Their understanding of communications equipment and protocols covers all conveyance technology from SatCom to VHF and they relay information and conduct ultra-sensitive surveillance and espionage.</li><li><a href=\"/toxo-viper/29-63612/\"><b>Toxo-Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Originally the Toxo-Vipers were referred to as the \u201cLeaky Suit Brigade\u201d, and assignment to them was considered severe punishment. While the new Toxo-Vipers sport top quality state-of-the-art equipment, which greatly increases their survival ratio, it is still considered a punishment as they have to deal with intensely toxic sludge.</li><li><b>Toxo-Zombies</b> \u2013 Toxo-Zombies are the result of Toxo-Vipers who suffered prolonged constant exposure to the worst chemical wastes. The radioactive byproducts and toxic sludge have mutated them into vile deformed zombies. They are not really alive, but not dead either, somewhere in-between.</li><li><a href=\"/vipers/29-7753/\"><b>Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Cobra Viper commandos carry out extremely dangerous and deadly missions. They attack convoys and other military patrols. They are supported by advanced vehicles and weapons which they use to ruthlessly bombard their targets. They wear multi-layered body armor and wrap around helmets with built-in communication gear. They also carry multi-burst laser pistols, commando rifles and grenade launchers.</li></ul><p><b>Cobra Command Air Force Commander:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/wild-weasel/29-11047/\"><b>Wild Weasel</b></a> \u2013 Wild Weasel learned his flying skills while running Cobra operations in every hemisphere in the world. He has extensive knowledge of close support aircraft ranging from jury-rigged civilian conversions to state-of-the-art flying weapons platforms. His main battlefield strategy is to swoop in with his <a href=\"/cobra-rattler/18-55993/\">Cobra Rattler</a> and take out enemy armored vehicles to reduce the opposition for Cobra ground forces. When he gets into the cockpit of the Night Adder he goes looking for trouble just so he can open fire with the side guns and launch of massive array of missiles at any G.I. Joe aircraft unlucky enough to invade his airspace.</li></ul><p><b>Cobra Command Air Force:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/aero-viper/29-63613/\"><b>Aero-Vipers</b></a> \u2013 Aero-Vipers are not surgically or bio-organically altered like Strato-Vipers and Star-Vipers; they lift weights and learn to take the pressure from g-forces and hard aircraft maneuvers. In the 90\u2019s they piloted the then advanced technology <a href=\"/cobra-condor-z-25/18-56004/\">Cobra Condor Z-25</a> which had forward swept wings and computer driven servo-actuators which allowed it to perform a turning radius roughly half that of an F-16. Currently they are combat and reconnaissance pilots that are trained in stealth and evasion tactics to conduct clandestine operations using the most advanced stealth jets, the Crimson Hydra.</li><li><b>Air Devils</b> \u2013 Air Devils are front-line stealth assault air commandos that are highly trained in unorthodox combat styles and dirty fighting. They use <a href=\"/cobra-viper-hangglider/18-56246/\">Cobra Gliders</a> to silently fly past enemy defenses to penetrate deep behind the lines to wreak havoc from within. They are lightly armed due to weight restrictions, but they can procure heavier weapons and ammunition from enemy forces they sneak up on and overtake.</li><li><b><a href=\"/astro-viper/29-63607/\">Astro-Vipers</a></b> \u2013 Astro-Vipers are Cobranauts whose mission is to maintain and repair satellite surveillance technology. Astro-Vipers are the only ones qualified besides TARGATS for duty in the voids of space. As Cobra\u2019s network of \u201ceyes-in-the-sky\u201d grows, so does the demand for more technicians capable of being Cobranauts, whom need to be able to withstand repeated high-G launching and extensive tours of duty in orbit. They are recruited from the ranks of the Strato-Vipers.</li><li><a href=\"/avac/29-63599/\"><b>A.V.A.C.</b></a> \u2013 The AVAC (Air Viper, Advanced Class) is a <a href=\"/cobra-firebat/18-55995/\">Cobra Firebat Jet</a> pilot who has been specially trained and has exceptional pilot and navigation skills. They need these skills as the Firebat has minimal pilot instrumentation. Piloting a Firebat has been described as strapping yourself onto a cannonball, as it is vertically launched for takeoff and only contains a basic flight panel, throttle, pedals and stick, no navigation and no ejection seat.</li><li><b><a href=\"/blackstar/29-63674/\">Blackstars</a></b> \u2013 Cobra Commander has formed an alliance with a secretive legion of space pilots called Blackstar. Their origin is unknown, but they are the best at what they do. They have incredible agility in zero-gravity environments and can engage in stellar dogfights. As no one has ever seen a Blackstar up close, there are questions as to whether or not they are even human.</li><li><b><a href=\"/gyro-viper/29-63601/\">Gyro-Vipers</a></b> \u2013 Gyro-Vipers are the pilots of the <a href=\"/cobra-mamba/18-55999/\">Cobra Mamba</a> which are smaller, faster attack helicopters with very little armor. Gyro-Vipers are fast, decisive thinkers with even quicker reactions. They describe helicopter flying as operating a yo-yo with your left hand while spinning a pie plate on the tip of your right index finger while you balance full glasses of water on top of both feet. Now piloting an attack helicopter is like doing all that while riding a 12 point buck through the woods during hunting season.</li><li><b><a href=\"/night-vulture/29-63658/\">Night Vultures</a></b> \u2013 Night Vultures are like Air Devils, they use Cobra Gliders to insert themselves covertly and conduct recon missions. As part of their training, they are dropped from a transport miles from land over shark-infested waters. Those who make it back earn the Night Vulture badge and earn the right to keep the personal effects of those who \u201cdrop-out.\u201d</li><li><b><a href=\"/sky-creeper/29-63659/\">Sky Creeper</a></b> \u2013 Sky Creeper created his first glider out of bed sheets and broom sticks and used it to successfully escape reform school. His criminal career consists of robbing fancy rooftop restaurant patrons and then escaping by jumping off and gliding off into the darkness. Sky Creeper was recruited by one of the Dreadnoks during a prison stint, he formed the Night Vultures, which he commands.</li><li><b><a href=\"/star-viper/29-63611/\">Star-Vipers</a></b> \u2013 A Star-Viper is a qualified Cobra Strato-Viper with an electro-magnetic shunt implanted into the brain which stimulates the reflexes while heightening awareness for split second decisions. This is necessary during the high-speed, upper-atmospheric dog fights they take part in. Early on they piloted the Cobra Stellar Stiletto, which could fly at Mach speeds and was equipped with laser guns and deep space missiles. Currently they fly the Sand Serpent which is an experimental aircraft designed by M.A.R.S. Industries; and employs stealth technology so it can bombard aerial and ground forces.</li><li><b><a href=\"/strato-viper/29-11040/\">Strato-Vipers</a></b> \u2013 The Strato-Vipers are the \u201ccr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me\u201d of the Air-Vipers. A Strato-Viper candidate must have 1,500 hours of flight time logged, a fixed wing rating of at least 4 engines, combat experience and an impeccable security clearance. They must also be willing to undergo a surgical enhancement that makes them resistant to hypoxia, hyperventilation and other decompression illnesses that affect pilots above 63,000 feet. They pilot the fast and stealthy <a href=\"/cobra-night-raven/18-55997/\">Cobra Night Raven</a>.</li><li><b>Vapor</b> \u2013 Vapor is an unbeatable sky warrior who pilots the <a href=\"/hurricane/18-56226/\">Cobra Hurricane VTOL</a> tactical fighter. He has direct shunts from his optic nerve to his inboard targeting computers. All data is projected to his helmet\u2019s field of vision screen. He also utilizes an advanced laser-powered, heads-up-display target locator which can control and fire the weapons by simple voice commands.</li></ul><p><b>Others:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"/kwinn/29-11079/\"><b>Kwinn</b></a> - An Inuit mercenary who only appeared in the first year of the comic book. A mercenary with a strong code of honor, he had previously worked for the CIA, Mossad, MI6, and the KGB, and worked with Cobra in Sierra Gordo. He would later renounce his life as a mercenary, only to be betrayed and killed by Dr. Venom. A hidden grenade then slays Venom.</li><li><a href=\"/blackout/29-49579/\"><b>Blackout</b></a> - Sniper Thomas J. Stall was rejected by G.I. Joe for failing his psychological exam and was suspected of being involved with the disappearance of his sister. After being imprisoned, Thomas broke out of a brig at Fort Huachuca during an attack by Cobra, to whom he surrendered willingly and subsequently joined.</li></ul><h3>Bases</h3><p>Cobra\u2019s primary base is Cobra Island. Cobra is said to have\nbases, underground cells and even whole communities scattered across the globe.\nFollowing are several specific locations with names:</p><ul><li><b>Springfield</b> - A small anonymous U.S. town was the first entirely Cobra controlled town, which Cobra secretly operated as a base. Cobra stored a lot of equipment and vehicles there; many home garages had military vehicles such as tanks inside. Many covert operations were held there, including the creation of Serpentor, which in turn directly led to the town's population being evacuated to Cobra Island after <a href=\"/gi-joe-a-real-american-hero-the-battle-of-springfield/37-76204/\">the Battle for Springfield</a>, took place.</li><li><a href=\"/broca-beach-new-jersey/34-56486/\"><b>Broca Beach, New Jersey</b></a> \u2013 Broca is an anagram of Cobra. After Springfield, Cobra overtook another town as their secret base of operations in America. This one was transformed from an abandoned seaside town and was run by the Dreadnoks with the help of multiple Cobra operatives. The displaced residents of the destroyed Springfield town were relocated here.</li><li><b>Delhi Hills</b> \u2013 After a rough mission campaign, G.I. Joes <a href=\"/rock-roll/29-41764/\">Rock\u2019N\u2019Roll</a>, <a href=\"/alpine/29-11085/\">Alpine</a>, <a href=\"/bazooka/29-11087/\">Bazooka</a> and <a href=\"/mutt/29-11053/\">Mutt</a> meet up for a little R&amp;R at a small town bar. They later discover that the bar and the whole town are inhabited by Cobra affiliates. They get captured, later escape, and by time they return with reinforcements all evidence Cobra was there has been eliminated.</li><li><b>Castle Destro</b> - Destro's fortress in <a href=\"/scotland/34-55911/\">Scotland</a>. Training ground for the Iron Grenadiers. During a feud between Destro and Cobra Commander it was destroyed by Cobra Commander, and a new castle was presumably reconstructed some years later.</li><li><b>Cobra Citadel</b> also known as the <a href=\"/silent-castle/34-56495/\"><b>Silent Castle</b></a> - Cobra's base of operations in the Balkan regions, located in Trans-Carpathia. Owned primarily by Destro, he incorporated many secret passageways and features into the castle's architecture including the ability to shift its configuration (through a complex series of levels, pulleys, and gears) into a near-exact likeness of Castle Destro - both internally and externally. Cobra Commander initially gave up the rights to the castle to Destro, but he later decided he wanted it back as it was rather close to his operations in Darklonia.</li><li><b>Cobra Consulate</b> - A towering high-rise in <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a> used by Cobra as an embassy and base of operations after Cobra Island was declared a sovereign nation. Its top levels were destroyed in a battle with G.I. Joe, and the building was abandoned by Cobra for some time (save for a few late-night top-secret meetings).</li><li><a href=\"/cobra-island/34-56485/\"><b>Cobra Island</b></a> - The primary base of Cobra operations located somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. It was created after a massive man-made earthquake. Cobra lawyers, well-prepared, moved in and had it legally declared a sovereign nation. It was the battlefield for the Cobra Civil War, and the battle against Serpentor and ' <a href=\"/the-coil/29-7741/\">the Coil</a>'. After Cobra abandoned it for several years, the island was seized by the U.N. It then came under the control of the Coil, then Cobra, and was finally destroyed by a nuclear warhead, which also killed every member of the Coil.</li><li><a href=\"/millville/34-56189/\"><b>Millville</b></a> \u2013 An industrial-heavy steel town that fell into economic ruin after the closing of the local plant. When Cobra descends literally invading them <a href=\"/gi-joe-a-real-american-hero-seeds-of-empire/37-133227/\">one day</a>, the residents are immediately subjugated to a brainwashing device, leading to the formation of a local resistance with the help of Mutt and <a href=\"/spirit/29-12192/\">Spirit</a>.</li><li><b>Monolith Base</b> - A massive mountain complex located in Badhikistan. It served as Cobra's main base after Cobra Island was taken over by Serpentor and his Coil forces.</li></ul><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animated Television Series</h3>",

Originally Zemo was a major threat during World War II and was the second most feared man throughout the Nazi regime, standing only one foot away from the <a href=\"/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a> himself. Much like Red Skull, Zemo would also become a major threat for Captain America and <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky</a>. His hatred for the American hero would increase when his face was merged to the hooded mask that he was wearing during a fight against Captain America. Because of this incident, Zemo had long obsessed over the death of Captain America and was willing to cheat the Red Skull from doing it himself. After World War II was coming to an end and Red Skull was believed to have died, Zemo later lured both Captain America and Bucky into a trap that nearly killed both heroes. Believing that his nemesis and his annoying sidekick was finally dead, Zemo was unaware that both heroes managed to survive as Captain America accidentally went into suspended animation within arctic waters while Bucky was found by the communist Russians who brainwashed him into becoming their own assassin.</p><p>Zemo found himself avoiding capture for his war crimes after the war ended and relocated as a ruler in a South American tribe where he created his own private kingdom. After years of living in seclusion, Zemo would finally be shocked to learn of Captain America\u2019s actual return and found himself dedicated to ensure that Captain America\u2019s death would be more ensured once and for all.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1800922\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56196/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2__super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1800922\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56196/1800922-baronzemo1___copy__2__medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Zemo knew that Captain America\u2019s newest allies, the Avengers would prove to be a threat against Captain America\u2019s death, which forced him to take an alternate method to take on the his old enemy. Studying each member of the Avengers, Zemo carefully formed his own incarnation of villains that was comparable to the Avengers and with each member who individually posed a major threat towards a certain member of the Avengers. Recruiting villains like the <a href=\"/melter/29-7260/\">Melter</a> who once was a serious threat for <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, the criminal scientist known as <a href=\"/black-knight/29-3172/\">Black Knight</a> who tangled with both <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Ant Man</a> and <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a>, and <a href=\"/radioactive-man/29-4807/\">Radioactive Man</a> who was a threat for the Mighty <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> himself. With each villain promised his rightful vengeance by strength in numbers, secretly Zemo dubbed this team as the Masters of Evil. Even though each member served together for their promised opportunity for revenge, Zemo cared less for the motives of his team seeing how the main goal of the Masters of Evil was to ensure that there would be no obstacles that stood in his way when killing Captain America once and for all.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Masters of Evil were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1964 and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-avengers/49-2128/\">The Avengers</a> #6.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"399234\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil_super.jpg\" title=\"1st Masters of Evil\"><img id=\"399234\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/399234-199795-masters-of-evil_medium.jpg\" alt=\"1st Masters of Evil\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">1st Masters of Evil</div></div></div></div><p>Baron Zemo and his Masters of Evil decided that the best approach against the Avengers was to draw the heroes into battle. Zemo and his team did so when he attacked <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a> with his <a href=\"/adhesive-x/18-56748/\">Adhesive X</a>, a substance that was proclaimed to have no solution. With a majority of the population trapped by Zemo\u2019s attack, the responding Avengers would find themselves unprepared against Zemo and the Masters of Evil because of the Adhesive X they were using. Capturing <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Giant Man</a> and Captain America, the remaining Avengers was forced into fleeing and finds a way to fight against the Masters of Evil and the Adhesive X. Much like Zemo, Captain America was shocked to learn of Zemo was still alive and the hero wanted revenge for death of his partner Bucky. Elsewhere the Avengers located the <a href=\"/trapster/29-4328/\">Trapster</a>, a villain who specializes in adhesive for a solution to Zemo\u2019s Adhesive X. With the help of Trapster because of wanting a lighter sentence for his prison term, the Avengers would secretly replace Zemo\u2019s Adhesive X canisters with solvent and manage to trick the Masters of Evil into dissolving the Adhesive X. This led to all but one of the Masters of Evil to face defeat and incarceration while Zemo escaped with no army at his side for his personal quest to kill Captain America.</p><h3>Darkest Hour</h3><p>With Zemo left with no army, no hopes with accomplishing his task on killing Captain America, and that a desperate Captain America was on his trail for murdering his partner Bucky, Zemo would finally catch another opportunity with the Avengers when encountering <a href=\"/enchantress/29-7225/\">Enchantress</a> and the <a href=\"/executioner/29-3517/\">Executioner</a> who were both recently exiled from <a href=\"/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> for their crimes against Thor. As both Asgardians joined Zemo and recreated a shorter version of the Masters of Evil, Zemo had Enchantress mystically force Thor into fighting against his own teammates. Nearly managing on destroying the Avengers, the arrival of Iron Man would release Thor from his hypnotic trance, which followed the God of Thunder individually sending the Masters of Evil into another dimension.</p><h3>Wonder Man</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1851639\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5586/1851639-wm1_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1851639\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5586/1851639-wm1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>After Enchantress managed to use her magic abilities to escape the dimension, Zemo decided that his next attack against the Avengers is by attacking them from within. By doing this, Zemo needed to recruit another member into the Masters of Evil and somebody who could easily pose as a hero. Deciding that the best way to do this is by also using his technology to grant ionic powers and to ensure absolute loyalty. Zemo would find a possible candidate for his goals within <a href=\"/hollywood/29-25860/\">Simon Williams</a>, who was recently fired for embezzlement. Blindly accepting Zemo\u2019s offer for freedom from his prison stint and gaining powers, Zemo turned Willaims into an ionic-powered being dubbed <a href=\"/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>. Following through with Zemo\u2019s plan by finding acceptance within the Avengers because of his heroic actions, Zemo would cue Wonder Man the precise moment to betray the Avengers and finally rid the heroes and Captain America once and for all. To ensure full loyalty from Williams, Zemo also advise Willaims that his powers are temporary and that his body would need a periodically serum dosage to stabilize his ionic physiology. However Wonder Man would change his idea of luring the Avengers into Zemo\u2019s trap and sacrificed himself to save his teammates from Zemo and the Masters of Evil.</p><h3>The Time Traveling Immortus</h3><p>Zemo and the Masters of Evil would later be approached by the time traveling Immortus who offered his assistance on defeating the Avengers. With Immortus sending Space Phantoms disguised as historical figures of the past to attack the Avengers, he also managed to send Captain America back to 1760 London. With Captain America gone, the Masters of Evil made their attack against the Avengers and nearly succeeded on defeating them until Immortus returned Captain America to his rightful place in time because of how he was impressed with his display of heroism. With the Masters of Evil facing another defeat, Enchantress managed to restore time to before Zemo was approached by <a href=\"/immortus/29-7215/\">Immortus</a>. Even though time was restored within Reality-616, another reality known as Reality-64110 continues on with the fight and capture of the Masters of Evil.</p><h3>The Final Assault</h3><p>After his repeated and unsuccessful attempts, Zemo became desperate with Captain America\u2019s demise and decided to rebuild his Masters of Evil to directly attack the Avengers and find a way to lure Captain America away from the team and take on the hero himself. Managing to have Melter and Black Knight escape from their prison term, Baron Zemo was unable to have Radioactive Man rejoin his group because of him being deported to <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/34-55795/\">China</a> after his recent capture. Still having an equal group compared to the Avengers, Zemo next kidnapped Rick Jones and took him to his secluded base in <a href=\"/south-america/34-56960/\">South America</a> as a way to lure Captain America to Zemo. As the Masters of Evil launched a full-scale attack on the Avengers, Captain America followed Zemo\u2019s trail to his base and found himself battling Zemo and his hired men. As Zemo attempted to use his Death Ray against the Avenger, Captain America reflected the attack and caused Zemo to be blinded. Blinded and angered, Zemo shot his pistol wildly, which caused a landslide to crush and kill Baron Zemo. With Zemo dead, the remaining Masters of Evil didn\u2019t fare any better, as all members were defeated and captured besides Enchantress and the Executioner who managed to escape.</p><p>With one of the teams greatest threats finally coming to an end, Captain America would personally bury Zemo\u2019s body, as he would be convinced that Bucky\u2019s death was finally avenged.</p><h3>The Mysterious Crimson Cowl</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"97587\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil_super.jpg\" title=\"2nd Masters of Evil\"><img id=\"97587\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1808/97587-57665-masters-of-evil_medium.jpg\" alt=\"2nd Masters of Evil\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">2nd Masters of Evil</div></div></div></div><p>Secretly acting indirectly and strictly behind the scenes, the psychotic robot known as <a href=\"/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron</a> plan his attacks on the Avengers for the purposes of ruining his creator, Hank Pym. Adopting a criminal disguise as the <a href=\"/crimson-cowl/29-22613/\">Crimson Cowl</a>, Ultron would recruit Radioactive Man, Melter, <a href=\"/klaw/29-3171/\">Klaw</a>, <a href=\"/whirlwind/29-6828/\">Whirlwind</a>, and a new Black Knight who was the nephew of the original Black Knight who recently died from injuries after a battle with Iron Man. To make his true disguise and agenda more hidden, Ultron dubbed and recreated the team as the Masters of Evil. Managing to kidnap <a href=\"/jarvis/29-1781/\">Edwin Jarvis</a>, who was the butler for the Avengers, Ultron would hypnotize Jarvis into taking the disguise of the Crimson Cowl to further avoid his involvement or suspicion. Not only did Ultron frame Jarvis for his crimes as the Crimson Cowl, but also used him to gain information on the Avengers security systems and how to easily gain access into the <a href=\"/avengers-mansion/34-41036/\">mansion</a>. With this knowledge, Ultron guided his Masters of Evil into defeating and capturing the Avengers. With the Avengers captured, Ultron next directed his attention against New York City. Eventually members within the Masters began to disagree with their leaders goals, which caused Klaw into attacking him after being berated. Simply shrugging off Klaw's attack, Ultrons identity was finally discovered before Black Knight freed the Avengers and managed to defeat the criminal group after Ultron made his escape. With the Masters defeated, Black Knight would reveal himself to the Avengers as a hero who was following his uncles dying wish of not following the same footsteps as he did and decided to restore heroism to the Black Knight name by single handily defeating the reincarnated Masters of Evil.</p><p>Even though Ultron decided to move on without the assistance of any humans, this version of the Masters of Evil still continued to work together as they made another attempt against the Avengers. Yet, this version would prove less successful as they faced another quick defeat, which caused the Masters of Evil to part ways.</p><h3>Egghead's Ultimate Revenge</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1081437\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1081437\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1081437-1_3_2010_12_23_03_pm_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>A third Masters of Evil would be created when the criminal scientist known as <a href=\"/egghead/29-3797/\">Egghead</a> sought assistance with his plot for gaining revenge against Hank Pym and manipulating him into serving him. What was supposed to be the ultimate plan against Pym who recently was shunned from the Avengers, Egghead broke Whirlwind, <a href=\"/mac-gargan/29-4484/\">Scorpion</a>, <a href=\"/tiger-shark/29-6815/\">Tiger Shark</a>, and <a href=\"/moonstone/29-3279/\">Moonstone</a> out of form his own criminal group. However Egghead's plan would find itself quickly threatened when Whirlwind anticipated his attack on the Avengers by trying to gain revenge against the Wasp for his prior defeats. Forcing the remaining Masters to attack the unsuspecting Avengers, the criminal group found itself easily bested by the Avengers and sent back to prison. However Egghead was far from giving up on needing a group and decided to free Tiger Shark and Moonstone, but replaced Whirlwind and Scorpion with the <a href=\"/abe-jenkins/29-4822/\">Beetle</a>, <a href=\"/shocker/29-4825/\">Shocker</a>, and Radioactive Man. After remaking the roster, Egghead sent the group to kidnap Pym from court and make it look like Pym was working with the Masters so that he could increase the damage on Pym\u2019s reputation as a hero. Coercing Pym into creating a longevity serum, Egghead was unaware that Pym was secretly creating a device to use against him and that the Avengers have managed to locate Eggheads secret hideout. But before the Avengers arrived on the scene to rescue Pym, they found that Pym managed to single-handily defeat Egghead and all the Masters of Evil with the device that he made. With the Avengers arriving and seeing the victorious Pym standing over the defeated Masters, Egghead made one last attempt against Pym by trying to shoot him in the back with a pistol. However his attack was not only prevented by the arriving <a href=\"/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a> by shooting an <a href=\"/trick-arrow/18-55833/\">arrow</a> in the barrel, but also caused the pistol to backfire against Egghead that resulted with the criminal scientists death.</p><h3>Under Siege</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2021135\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100776/2021135-23957_344377098855_829193855_3545696_5801482_n.jpg\" title=\"Under Siege\"><img id=\"2021135\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100776/2021135-23957_344377098855_829193855_3545696_5801482_n_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Under Siege\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Under Siege</div></div></div></div><p>The next group of criminals that took the name Masters of Evil didn\u2019t make another appearance until the son of <a href=\"/baron-helmut-zemo/29-3278/\">Baron Helmut Zemo</a> found himself continuing his father\u2019s legacy and vendetta against Captain America for his prior defeat that also caused his entire face to be completely ruined. Baron Heinrich Zemo not only took up his father\u2019s mantle as a criminal mastermind, but also followed his father\u2019s very same footsteps by attempting to destroy Captain America and the Avengers. This time Zemo decided to take more calculating steps on bringing the Avengers to their knee\u2019s by forming not only a new incarnation of the Masters of Evil, but also a massive army that consisted of the most dangerous and deadliest foes who individually posed a threat for the Avengers. Zemo\u2019s army mostly consisted of villains that had brute strength and such as <a href=\"/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"/mr-hyde/29-3233/\">Mr. Hyde</a>, the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a>, <a href=\"/absorbing-man/29-1779/\">Absorbing Man</a>, and <a href=\"/titania/29-4943/\">Titania</a>. Some members were specifically important for Zemo such as <a href=\"/blackout/29-41820/\">Blackout</a> who displayed powers of manipulating the dark force and Moonstone who was the only one that could control him and his actions. Even though Moonstone did pose a threat against Zemo\u2019s leadership, he still kept her at a close distance and hid the fact that he had <a href=\"/fixer/29-3282/\">Fixer</a> implant commands in Blackout\u2019s mind that could make him control Blackout if ever needed too. Aside from Moonstone and Blackout, Fixer also assisted Zemo for his abnormal mechanical skills that also proved very useful for Zemo. Prior to his attack on the Avengers, Zemo sent a few villains such Yellow Jacket, Absorbing Man, and Titania to find possible recruits to help him and the Masters of Evil storm the Avengers Mansion. Yet these attempts proved unsuccessful and ended with <a href=\"/grey-gargoyle/29-6816/\">Grey Gargoyle</a> and <a href=\"/songbird/29-3281/\">Screaming Mimi</a> being arrested, also a meddling <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> managed to defeat both Absorbing Man and Titania while trying to recruit <a href=\"/mongoose/29-25662/\">Mongoose</a>. During this time, Zemo amused himself by sending both Whirlwind and Trapster to attack Captain America for initiation within his group. Knowing that both villains would fail, Zemo specifically sent Whirlwind on this mission because of his prior incident with the former Masters group that caused their defeat and could be a threat for his plans.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2422512\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117443/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33.jpg\" title=\"Avengers (1963) #277\"><img id=\"2422512\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117443/2422512-ohotmu_avengers__1___page_33_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers (1963) #277\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers (1963) #277</div></div></div></div><p>With Thor, who was one of the Avengers most powerful members being absent, Zemo waited for the exact opportunity to strike and did so when seeing most of the Avengers away from the building. Zemo and his army of super-villains not only managed to successfully infiltrate the mansion, but also captured Captain America, Black Knight, and Jarvis, also using Blackout to send <a href=\"/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a> into the <a href=\"/darkforce/12-41411/\">Darkforce</a>, and nearly beating <a href=\"/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a> to death. With the mansion completely taken over by Zemo and the Masters, Zemo used Blackout to shield the entire mansion with his Darkforce powers so that nobody would be able to enter or leave the mansion. With Hercules hospitalized, Zemo sent both Titania and Absorbing Man to ensure that his death was fulfilled, but this attempt found itself failing as both Ant-Man (<a href=\"/scott-lang/29-20577/\">Scott Lang</a>) and Wasp managed to prevent both Masters from killing Hercules. With Captain America captured and taunted by Zemo, the Avenger found himself forced into watching Jarvis being tortured and beaten by Mr. Hyde. With the destruction of the Avengers almost complete, the arrival of Thor and the remaining Avengers proved successful on defeating most of the Masters as they managed to penetrate into the mansion. As Thor and arriving Avengers, Zemo were defeating most of the Masters retreated to the roof with Blackout as the released Captain America pursued against him. Zemo would also find himself unable to use Blackout with the implanted commands because of <a href=\"/doctor-druid/29-10302/\">Dr. Druid</a> who was mentally guiding Blackout to retaliate against Zemo; this resulted with Blackout dying from a brain hemorrhage. With the Masters facing defeat and the Avengers building being nearly destroyed, Zemo made his attempt on fighting against Captain America only to find himself falling to his seemingly death. Believing to be dead, Zemo managed to survive the fall and hid underground to rethink his plans against Captain America while the Avengers found themselves reorganizing and rebuilding the damages from Zemo\u2019s attack.</p><h3>The Raid of Dr Octopus</h3><p>With a new cosmic threat arising known as <a href=\"/magus/29-14619/\">Magus</a>, this forced most of the well-known heroic teams to fight against on their attempts to save reality. After noticing the heroes taking absence, <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Dr Octopus</a> decided that the time was right to raid the Avengers Mansion and steal any scientific equipment that would prove useful for research. Possibly influenced by Zemo\u2019s prior attack on the Avengers, Dr Octopus made his attempt to follow the same footsteps by forming his own Masters of Evil to help him raid the mansion and handle any possible threats that they may encounter. Even though Dr Octopus made his attempt to follow Zemo\u2019s same footsteps, his greatest flaw was his selection for the Masters, which half of the villains found themselves instantly defeated by the Avengers staff and the arriving <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. Despite Dr Octopus and a few Masters being capable of handling themselves against the Guardians, their encounter was interrupted by evil doppelgangers sent by Magus. Forced into forming an alliance with the Guardians, both teams managed to fend off the doppelgangers. Yet Dr. Octopus was still reluctant to raid the mansion and found that his remaining team opposed him. With the Masters of Evil defeated and departed, Dr. Octopus was forced to flee as well one of the opposing Masters known as <a href=\"/rita-demara/29-1501/\">Yellowjacket</a> found herself joining the Guardians of the Galaxy.</p><h3>Justice, Like Lightning</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2168580\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/2168580-499872889.jpg\" title=\"Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey\"><img id=\"2168580\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/2168580-499872889_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Thunderbolts by Declan Shalvey</div></div></div></div><p>Returning to his role as leader of the Masters of Evil, Zemo individually recruited each member of his newest formation of the Masters of Evil. It was during this time that the main heroic teams such as the Avengers and <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> perished during <a href=\"/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a>'s attack, forced Zemo to take another approach with his reformed Masters. Seeing the absence of Earth's mightiest heroes as an opportunity to have the world under his control, Zemo and his Masters took a unique step on accomplishing this by secretly posing as heroes to gain public trust, trust that would put Zemo and his Masters closer to their goals. With Fixer\u2019s aid, the Masters found themselves re-equipped and taking different names as the entire group made their public appearance as the heroic Thunderbolts. In an ironic twist, Zemo and the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a> found themselves fighting another group who called themselves the Masters of Evil who was led by another mysterious Crimson Cowl. Even though Zemo\u2019s plan was proving successful as the Thunderbolts were gaining public trust as heroes, a rising threat towards his goals of world domination began to rise within the group when some of the members began following their heroic counterparts. Taking notice as to how some members began to steer away from Zemo\u2019s goals, Zemo pre-planned this by revealing their secret identities to public prior to his attempt for world takeover, forcing them into staying loyal to his plans and goals. As Zemo and the reluctant Thunderbolts managed to take over the world through means of mind control, the group found itself split apart as most of the Thunderbolts found themselves following their heroic identities by going against Zemo and <a href=\"/fixer/29-3282/\">Techno</a>. With aid of the Avengers and the Fantastic Four, Zemo\u2019s plan was foiled and his disguised Masters of Evil was now no more.</p><h3>Justine Hammer's Masters of Evil</h3><p>With Zemo and the original Masters of Evil no longer bearing the name as they continued to follow their heroic identities, only the mysterious villainous known as the Crimson Cowl found herself continuing her crime spree as leader of various incarnations of Masters of Evil. Deciding to blackmail the world with a weather-manipulating device, the Cowl assembled a large 25 member Masters of Evil as part of her own personal army to guard herself against any super hero attack. Things to a tragic turn when she was outsmarted by Moonstone of the Hawkeye's Thunderbolts who tricked her into thinking she would side with her, while the rest of her teammates defeated the large roster of super villains. However, the Crimson Cowl got the better of them when she teleported herself away and replaced herself with <a href=\"/dallas-riordan/29-4826/\">Dallas Riordan</a> as a way to fooling the Thunderbolts and the super-human community in thinking Riohard and turned traitor, but she was soon freed by the <a href=\"/v-battalion/65-22646/\">V-battalion</a> who broke out her out of prison. The real Crimson Cowl went into hiding for weeks before revealing herself to the public again by kidnapping Dallas who was on the run from the V-battalion after turning down an assassination plot against <a href=\"/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Peter Henry Gyrich</a> who was secretly being controlled by <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/29-4662/\">Baron Wolfegang Von Strucker</a>.</p><p>Dallas escaped the Cowl's clutches leaving her no choice, but to reveal her identity as <a href=\"/crimson-cowl/29-22613/\">Justine Hammer</a>, the daughter of long time Iron Man foe, <a href=\"/justin-hammer/29-10219/\">Justin Hammer</a>. It was then that Hammer decided to enact what was left of her father's legacy with a bio-toxin that was created by <a href=\"/blackheath/29-3283/\">Plant Man</a> when he was in service of Justin Hammer and the Cowl reassembled another set of the Masters of Evil. However, most of them betrayed her and sided with Hawkeye when he restructured the Thunderbolts with <a href=\"/songbird/29-3281/\">Songbird</a> and Plant Man chose to neutralize the toxin instead of releasing it. She was arrested and the Masters of Evil were finally put out of her control for several months.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><p>The super villain, Whirlwind decided to reassemble the Masters of Evil in an attempt to corrupt <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a>'s version of the Thunderbolts, but failed when Mac Gargan betrayed the group and allowed Osborn to defeat them.</p><h3>Secret Invasion and Dark Reign</h3><p>The Hood assembled a new Masters of Evil, a street-level gang of villains, for aiding him in his quest to become the new Kingpin of All Crime in New York.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"885707\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/885707-73_new_avengers_58.jpg\" title=\"The Hood\"><img id=\"885707\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/885707-73_new_avengers_58_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Hood\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Hood</div></div></div></div><p>While villains all, the Hood's gang assisted the heroes of the Marvel Universe in repelling the Skrull invasion during <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a> under the Hood's rationale that \"no more Earth is bad for business\".

The species that built the best one would be chosen to represent the planet. The Kree labored over building a city (what is now the blue area of the moon) while the Cotati slept. When the Skrulls came back to the moon to award a winner they found that the Cotati had grown a huge garden while they slept! The Cotati won the contest. Furious, the Kree killed all of the Cotati and all of the Skrulls that visited their planet. They then used the Skrull ship to go to the Skrull home world and start the Kree-Skrull wars.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1608302\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm_super.jpg\" title=\"As told by the Kree\"><img id=\"1608302\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1608302-1_8_2011_10_28_57_pm_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"As told by the Kree\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">As told by the Kree</div></div></div></div><p>The Second Kree-Skull War was started by the Skrulls although the Kree were considering it. The Skrulls were led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kylor/29-56638/\">Kylor</a>, one of five claiming to be Emperor of the Skrulls. After capturing a Kree spy on one of their worlds they decided to strike first. When the Supreme Intelligence lost his mind, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nenora/29-56642/\">Nenora</a> took over as Supreme Leader. Nenora was secretly a Skrull, but choose to remain a Kree and rule over all. She betrayed Kylor and her people. The Skrull campaign was taken over by Empress <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sbyll/29-41667/\">S'byll</a> after Kylor's death. Nenora was defeated by S'byll when she gave Nenora her shape-shifting powers back. S'byll announced to the Kree their leader was truly a Skrull and that she had won the war. But, S'byll declared a peace. Tus-Katt was the highest ranking member available and he did not accept a peace, this was against all the Kree stand for. The best he could accept was a truce, which she accepted.</p><p>With the loss of the Supreme Intelligence and Nenora the Kree were left without a leader. Through manipulation, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/contemplator/29-13988/\">Contemplator</a> was able to get the pirate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clumsy-foulup/29-29131/\">Clumsy Foulup</a> to become emperor. The emperor was assassinated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ael-dan/29-27760/\">Ael-Dan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dar-ben/29-27761/\">Dar-Benn</a>. They ruled the empire together, one being of blue skin and one of pink. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> killed half the universe with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinity-gauntlet/18-40945/\">Infinity Gauntlet</a>, the Kree automatically blamed the Skrulls for this unknown attack and prepared for war.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ael-dan/29-27760/\">Ael-Dan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dar-ben/29-27761/\">Dar Benn</a> are killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a> during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/operation-galactic-storm/39-27758/\">Kree/Shi'ar War</a>. After the Shi'ar are victorious due to the detonation of a Nega-Bomb over their throne world, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a> names Deathbird as regent. The whole Kree/Shi'ar War was orchestrated by the Supreme Intelligence as a way to jump start the Kree's evolutionary dead end, thus the Ruul was born. The Supreme Intelligence would later utilize this during the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maximum-security/39-49092/\">Maximum Security</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Annihilation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1608287\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1608287-1_8_2011_10_21_37_pm_super.jpg\" title=\"The Ruul\"><img id=\"1608287\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1608287-1_8_2011_10_21_37_pm_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Ruul\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Ruul</div></div></div></div><p>The universe is over-run by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilation-wave/65-55905/\">Annihilation Wave</a> under the command of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/29-10964/\">Annihilus</a>. During this time <a href=\"/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan the Accuser</a> is declared a traitor and removed from his position as Accuser. He makes several new allies as he searches for the evidence to clear his name during the attack. He learns that the House of Fiyero, who are merchants currently in control of the Kree Empire, are responsible. Under their poor leadership, the Kree are easy targets for the Annihilation Wave.</p><p>The Fiyero Kree attempt to make a deal and join forces with Annihilus so that the war would end and they could go back to their commerce. Finding the proof of his betrayal, Ronan executes the enemies of the empire and is named leader of the Kree after the mercy killing of the Supreme Intelligence (who had already been lobotomized by the Fiyero). He is forced to cede several Kree Worlds (including Kree-Lar) and the Skrull Empire to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ravenous/29-41748/\">Ravenous</a>.</p><h3>Annihilation Conquest</h3><p>Still recovering from the Annihilation Wave , Kree space was infiltrated by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phalanx/29-9651/\">Phalanx</a> using <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spaceknights/65-41517/\">Galadorian Space Knights</a> to take command over Kree military computers and weapons. It is only through the efforts of the soon to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova/29-2105/\">Nova</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warlock/29-7223/\">Warlock</a> that the Kree Empire is freed.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>The Kree have several operatives on Earth, one of which (posing as a human named William Wagner) learns of the invasion prior to it occurring. He is attacked by two Skrulls just before the invasion, his fate is currently unknown.</p><p>Due to the Skrulls having abducted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a> form an alliance with the Kree in an effort to locate him. Ronan's price for this alliance is the hand of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a> of the Inhuman Royal Family, a price her sister readily accepts. In the aftermath of the invasion the Inhumans leave the moon and travel to Kree space. They breach the barrier and confront Ronan who relinquishes the throne to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>During the Inhumans vengeance upon the Skrulls, a group of Shi'ar Warbirds are destroyed. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vulcan/29-21233/\">Emperor Vulcan</a> takes this as a challenge and sets his sights on conquering the Kree. The second Kree/Shi'ar War begins with the Shi'ar crashing the wedding of Ronan the Accuser and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a>.</p><p>Black Bolt unleashes his weapon known as the T-Bomb, a device made with the Terrigen Mists, in the belief it will make everyone into Inhumans and end the war. With the detonation of the bomb, Black Bolt and Vulcan both perish, and it also creates a rip in space known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-fault/34-56597/\">Fault</a>. With Black Bolt presumed dead, leadership of the Kree Empire is left to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>.</p><h3>War of the Four Cities</h3><p>It would come to be known that the experiment that created the Inhumans was prophesied to be the end of the Supreme Intelligence. Of the 100 races created, the Supreme Intelligence ordered them all destroyed. But five races survived. They would all come together to try and make the Earth their new home. The Inhumans, now lead by Black Bolt who had returned from the dead, left the empire in the hands of Ronan.</p><p>After all houses agreed to have him as leader, he and Crystal left for Earth to take complete control of the Kree Empire once and for all.</p><h2>Kree Groups</h2><h3>Attilan</h3><p>A group of Kree comes to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/attilan/34-44155/\">Attilan</a> to beg for sanctuary. They are attacked at first until they tell what they're there. They are then given tents to stay in, in the empty place of old Kree machinery. A group of Kree goes to kill the Inhuman Royal Family but is stopped. Another is gone to the Genetics Council to see if the hearing goes in their favor for them to stay permanently. Another group is mad that they have to beg the Inhumans, creatures they created for their slaves. They decide to go and destroy the one thing that gives them their powers, the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/18-55807/\">Terrigen Crystals.</a> When they get there, they are attacked by Inhumans. They tell the Inhumans they don't want to destroy the mists but use them. They tell them when the Avengers hit the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nega-bands/18-42360/\">Nega Bands</a> above their city it did something to their genes so they could use the mists. Three went in and two came out alive.</p><p>The Kree attacked the Inhumans. They caught them very easily but with causalities. They separated the Inhumans by age, separating the old from the young. They sends machines over the city, for when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a> screamed they picked the city up. The Kree wanted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a> to help build up their status in the universe, they wanted to rule the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a>. Ronan was to send the Inhumans to attack the Shi'ar.</p><h3>Priests of Pama</h3><p>The <a href=\"/priests-of-pama/65-57481/\">Priests of Pama</a> are a group of pacifist Kree. They reside on Earth and have a relationship with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cotati/65-46135/\">Cotati</a>. They trained <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mantis/29-3324/\">Mantis</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> to be the Celestial Madonna.</p><h3>Ruul</h3><p>The Supreme Intelligence evolved the remaining \"true\" Kree into Ruul using the forever crystal. The Ruul however have been removed from existence due to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genis-vell/29-4813/\">Genis-Vell</a>.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>History</h2>\n<h3>Origin</h3>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vanisher/29-6756/\">   Vanisher</a> was never a moral individual. &nbsp;As a mutant with the ability to teleport anywhere he wished, he often used his skills to steal or blackmail others. &nbsp;Yet after an adventure when he was caught travelling through another dimension with the teleporting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">   X-Man</a> known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">   Nightcrawler</a>, the Vanisher decided it was time to take life a little easier. &nbsp;So he settled down in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">   New York</a> and gathered around him a group of teenaged runaways. &nbsp;In exchange for giving them shelter in his Beat Street Club, they would have to go out on the city streets and steal whatever they could find. &nbsp;Picking pockets, stealing purses and swiping food, they would take back their ill-gotten gains to the Vanisher who would then keep a large percentage of it for himself. &nbsp;Sometimes the Vanisher managed to recruit girls with super human powers, which would aid them in their daily quest to find more money and food. &nbsp;Yet the girls didn't always appreciate his unique brand of generosity, and sometimes girls like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/boom-boom/29-2159/\">   Boom-Boom</a> would leave after they demanded more.<br /><br />\n<h3>Aliens &amp; Cyborgs</h3>The all-girl group underwent a few changes after Boom-Boom was taken in by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">   X-Factor</a>. &nbsp;Most of the regular human girls left the team, leaving <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ariel/29-41840/\">   Ariel</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chance-fallen-angels/29-44914/\">   Chance</a> to find new members. &nbsp;Chance was believed to be a normal human, while Ariel gladly used her space-bending teleportation as often as possible. &nbsp;Together they tracked down a young boy nicknamed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gomi/29-7913/\">   Gomi</a> (Japanese for 'garbage') and his two lobster associates <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bill/29-7631/\">   Bill</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/don/29-7912/\">   Don</a>. &nbsp;All three of them were cyborgs resulting from the experiments of Gomi's older cousin, while Don was also considered to be a mutant lobster due to his blue&nbsp;coloration. &nbsp;Unbeknownst to the Vanisher, Ariel had a hidden agenda; she didn't just want to repopulate his team of young thieves, she was recruiting as many mutated beings as she could find. &nbsp;As a team, this group of runaways would be known as the Fallen Angels. \n<br /><br />\n<h3>Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\"

was Chance who accidentally stumbled across their first new mutant. &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">    Sunspot</a> had recently runaway from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">   New Mutants</a> after he lashed out at his best friend and accidentally knocked <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">   Cannonball</a> unconscious. &nbsp;He'd run away to the city where he found Chance being threatened by local street thugs. &nbsp;Although Ariel rescued Chance leaving Sunspot to face the thugs alone, they later went in search of their first mutant. &nbsp;By the time Gomi, Bill &amp; Don found Sunspot, he was accompanied by Warlock. &nbsp;Fortunately for Ariel &amp; Chance, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">   Magneto</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">   Moira MacTaggert</a> had sent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siryn/29-3181/\">   Siryn</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madrox/29-7910/\">   Multiple Man</a> in search of the two runaway New Mutants and therefore they also joined the team. &nbsp;At the time they believed that Boom-Boom was being held prisoner by the mutant hunters, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">   X-Factor</a>, so Ariel demonstrated her space-bending alien abilities to everyone just in time to save Boom-Boom as she was being chased by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">   Beast</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">   Iceman</a>. &nbsp;Ariel's collection of young mutants was completed after a brief inter-galactic trip to a jungle-forest planet where they recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/devil-dinosaur/29-2172/\">   Devil Dinosaur</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moon-boy/29-7224/\">   Moon Boy</a>.<br /><br />\n<h3>Multiple Trouble</h3>Returning back to New York the Vanisher sent the team out to scavenge more food. &nbsp;They paired off with Ariel &amp; Chance, Sunspot &amp; Warlock, Siryn &amp; Multiple Man, and Boom-Boom with Gomi and the lobsters. &nbsp;While Ariel &amp; Chance were tormenting Sunspot &amp; Warlock, Boom-Boom discovered one of Multiple Man's duplicates wandering around the street. &nbsp;He desperately ran away from her and didn't watch where he was going when he ran into the street. &nbsp;A cyclist hit the duplicate breaking some of his ribs, the pain of which was fed to the original Multiple Man a few streets away. &nbsp;<br /><br />In the midst of all the chaos, no-one had noticed that Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy had slipped out of the Beast Street Club. &nbsp;Despite the dinosaur's large physique and bizarre appearance on a New York street, they were unnoticed until a large cracking noise as heard. &nbsp;It was the tragic demise of Don, who had been crushed underfoot by Devil Dinosaur. \n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"691891\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a

Spill The Beans To Boom-Boom</div></div></div></div><br /><br />As the remaining Fallen Angels feasted at Don's wake, Multiple Man and his rogue duplicate discussed re-absorption, how that would be like dying, and the possibilities of further mutation. &nbsp;The duplicate didn't want to be re-absorbed and opted to have his own life, even if it meant living with the pain of broken ribs. &nbsp;They theorised that it was a further mutation or Multiple Man's own multiplying power. &nbsp;Using the portable <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">   Cerebro</a> unit that Magneto had given them to find Sunspot &amp; Warlock, the Multiple Men began to detect the presence of two new mutants: Ariel &amp; Chance. &nbsp;<br /><br />Meanwhile, the young mutants began to experience strange fluctuations in their mutant powers. &nbsp;A slight tap would trigger off dozens of Multiple Men duplicates, while Siryn could suddenly shatter metal, and the Vanisher vanished uncontrollably. &nbsp;Then as a complete reversal, all of their powers would suddenly disappear. &nbsp;Multiple Man's duplicates all mysteriously disappeared (except for the wounded one), Boom-Boom's time-bomb didn't detonate, and Warlock became murderously enraged. &nbsp;The wounded Multiple Man duplicate continued to study Cerebro, but he could not yet determine whether it was Chance or Ariel that was causing the trouble.<br /><br />\n<h3>Betrayal</h3>Ariel convinced the others that New York was too much trouble, and that she the best place for them: The Coconut Grove. &nbsp;There the team were treated like VIPs and received a make-over from their hosts. &nbsp;All except Chance who screamed in terror at the prospect of being feminine, and was subsequently mocked by Sunspot. &nbsp;The team was relaxed and didn't suspect a thing. &nbsp;The girls tormented Sunspot, Multiple Man gained another independent duplicate, and when Boom-Boom was accidentally left behind she didn't seem to mind since she was being praised by the locals for her amazing mutant powers. &nbsp;<br /><br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"174376\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/174376-25889-sunspot_super.jpg\" title=\"Coconut Grove Make-Over\"><img id=\"174376\"

Make-Over</div></div></div></div>Gathering together, Multiple Man revealed that Cerebro had not been wrong earlier. &nbsp;He continued to read&nbsp;distinctive&nbsp;mutant signatures from both Ariel and Chance, except for when all their mutant powers were cancelled out when only Chance registered. &nbsp;They deduced that Chance could 'Double or Nothing' their powers by increasing them or completely removing them, and Ariel had the gift of the gab by being able to sweet talk others into doing what she wanted. &nbsp;The whole conversation had been overheard by Coconut Grove guards who informed their leader, Unipar.<br /><br />When the Coconut Grove guards attacked, the Fallen Angels were soon taken captive. &nbsp;Although Ariel's deal with Unipar meant that Chance was not to be taken too, they quickly&nbsp;seized&nbsp;her as they knew she was a mutant. &nbsp;Ariel turned to leave, so she didn't have to see the friends she'd betrayed, but then was&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;imprisoned within a force-field pillar. &nbsp;The captive Fallen Angels were thrown into a cell which dampened mutant powers, Gomi was blindfolded and locked inside a spinning cage, while Boom-Boom was being experimented on. &nbsp;Ariel remained inside her cramped pillar of energy, and was socially rejected by the rest of the team.<br /><br />Unipar was determined to continue his experiments on the mutants. &nbsp;They would not go quietly, and therefore he shot the third Multiple Man duplicate. &nbsp;The death instantly sent a psychic feedback to the remaining Multiple Men and scared the others into silence. &nbsp;As all three Multiple Men were taken away, Sunspot offered to go to support his traumatised friend.<br /><br />\n<h3>Escape <br /></h3>Due to his&nbsp;diminutive&nbsp;stature, Bill had remained undetected by the guards. &nbsp;The little green lobster cyborg made his way to the cells and battered any guard that was in his way. &nbsp;Finding the keys to the cell, he quickly liberated the team. &nbsp;They were ready to abandon Ariel, but took pity on her and freed her from the force-field pillar. &nbsp;They soon located Sunspot and the Multiple Men, who agreed to re-absorb and fight for their freedom. &nbsp;<br /><br />Chance gained control over her powers and boosted the abilities of the others. &nbsp;Ariel used her voice based manipulation to convince Unipar to let them go. &nbsp;Devil Dinosaur destroyed the room and threatened savage violence if they were chased. &nbsp;Ultimately Unipar was informed that all of his scientific experiments were pointless, as their own kind had already begun to evolve again and Ariel was the living proof. &nbsp;<br /><br />\n<h3>The End<br /></h3>Ariel returned everyone back to the Beat Street Club. &nbsp;Sunspot and Warlock parted to return to school. &nbsp;Boom-Boom returned to X-Factor. &nbsp;Devil Dinosaur and Moon Boy were sent home to their jungle planet. &nbsp;Siryn and Multiple Man stayed with the remaining Fallen Angels saying that they were a good bunch who just needed a little guidance. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3>Trivia</h3>The cover of the first issue of the series says \"One moment of anger, and their lives are changed forever\". Although this may seem as just a marketing gimmick there is a sense of truth in it. <br />That is because all the events happening in this issue have impact right up until the end of \"The Fall of the Mutants\" story line, published in New Mutants 59-61. Because Sunspot hit Cannonball in rage after a game of footbal, he and Warlock left the New Mutants. They only came back at the end of \" The Fall of the Mutants\" story line. Just a few minutes after Sunspot and Warlock returned to help their teammates fight <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cameron-hodge/29-13379/\" rel=\"nofollow\">   Cameron Hodge</a> and his elite robots, their friend and teammate Doug Ramsey (aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">   Cypher</a>) was shot and killed. Though nothing is certain, but it could be possible that, had Sunspot and Warlock stayed with the New Mutants, they could have turned the tied in favor of the mutants, and thus preventing the death of Doug.<br />&nbsp; \n<h2>Epilogue</h2>\n<h3>X-Team Adventures</h3>Eventually the rest of the team also disbanded. &nbsp;Gomi, Bill, Ariel and Chance have not been seen since, while Devil Dinosaur &amp; Moon Boy continue to re-appear in various places. &nbsp;Yet many of the other members have gone on to be in more popular teams, particularly X-Factor &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">   X-Force</a>.<br /><br />Siryn and Multiple Man returned to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/muir-island/34-43505/\">   Muir Island</a> at some undisclosed point, and were later mind controlled by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadow-king/29-14889/\">   Shadow King</a>. &nbsp;Multiple Man joined the government backed incarnation of X-Factor and created X-Factor Investigates. &nbsp;Siryn became a long-time member of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">   Cable's</a> X-Force, and rejoined Multiple Man in X-Factor.<br /><br />Boom-Boom was also a long-term member of Cable's X-Force with Siryn, and later had a brief relationship with Sunspot. &nbsp;He joined and left X-Force on various occasions and became a public figure when working with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-corporation/65-40425/\">   X-Corporation</a>. &nbsp;He even became the Lord Imperial of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">   Hellfire Club</a> before aiding the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-x-men/65-51146/\">   Young X-Men</a> &amp; eventually reuniting with his New Mutants team-mates. &nbsp;Boom-Boom was a member of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nextwave/65-40478/\">   NextWave</a> who fought an evil talking version of Devil Dinosaur who claimed he had eaten Moon Boy. &nbsp;Neither of them recalled their adventures together (although there are theories to state that was in an alternate reality).<br /><br />Warlock has returned from the dead, and returned to outer space where he attempts to cure the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">   Kree</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/technarchy/65-49537/\">   technarch</a> inflicted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/techno-organic/12-43631/\">   techno-virus</a>. &nbsp;He has since sired a son of his own, and is slated to appear in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/49-26327/\">   New Mutants</a>.<br /><br />The Vanisher has been drafted into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">   Cyclops</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">   Wolverine's</a> X-Force. &nbsp;He had previously encountered the first X-Force during a heist on Hawaii where he did not recognise Siryn and even tried to chat her up.&nbsp; During the Second Coming event Vanisher was severely wound and presumed to have died.<br />&nbsp;<br />Ariel recently appeared aiding the X-Men during a riot in San Francisco and resided on Utopia. Unfortunatly she was killed in a car explosion during the Second Coming event.",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Originally from the planet <a href=\"/maltus/34-56204/\">Maltus</a>, the race that would become the Guardians was one of the first races of intelligent life in the universe. Evolving quickly, they developed a society devoted to knowledge and&nbsp;science, often involving themselves in experiments on other planets. One of the Maltusians, <a href=\"/krona/29-27246/\">Krona</a>, engaged in a forbidden experiment to witness the creation of the universe. Though his fellows attempted to stop him, the damage had been done&nbsp;and the universe was splintered, causing the creation of the <a href=\"/dc-multiverse/12-43603/\">Multiverse</a>, as well as the Antimatter universe <a href=\"/qward/34-41619/\">Qward</a>. The Maltusians relocated to <a href=\"/oa/34-41360/\">Oa</a> and dedicated themselves to destroying the evil and rescuing the universe from chaos. To this end, they eventually harnessed the <a href=\"/glow/12-55738/\">Glow</a> to create the <a href=\"/central-power-battery/18-55704/\">Central Power Battery</a> and ultimately the <a href=\"/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a>.&nbsp;Later divisions in the group saw the creation of the <a href=\"/zamarons/65-39176/\">Zamarons</a>, the <a href=\"/the-controllers/65-22708/\">Controllers</a>, and the Mesopotamian Gods and <a href=\"/leprechauns/65-57730/\">Leprechauns</a> on <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a>.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>The Guardians of the Universe were created by <a href=\"../../john-broome/26-48152/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Broome</a> and <a href=\"../../gil-kane/26-1764/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gil Kane</a></p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Early Battles &nbsp;</h3> In their quest to confront evil and chaos, the Guardians come into conflict with a number of races, including the <a href=\"/the-reach/65-48034/\">Reach</a>, the <a href=\"/martians/65-55381/\">Martians</a> and the <a href=\"/legion/29-52006/\">Tchkk-Tchkki</a>. They also deal with the entity <a href=\"/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a>, and attempt to remove all the magic from the universe, resulting in the creation of the <a href=\"/starheart/18-47348/\">Starheart</a>. They create the <a href=\"/the-manhunters/65-55857/\">Manhunters</a>, precursors to the Lantern Corps, who ultimately rebel and remain eternal enemies of the Guardians.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>Crisis on Infinite Earths &nbsp;</h3> The Guardians are unsure about the best way to handle the <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis</a>. A small group of Guardians who favour aggressive involvement in combatting the Crisis are the impetus for the recruitment of <a href=\"/guy-gardner/29-1791/\">Guy Gardner</a> into the Corps. After the Crisis has ended, the Guardians are troubled by their indecisiveness and divisiveness during the Crisis, and decide to retreat from the universe.&nbsp;<br /><h3>New Guardians &nbsp;</h3> The Guardians leave a sing Guardian, <a href=\"/appa-ali-apsa/29-26914/\">Appa Ali Apsa</a>, behind to take care of Oa. The control of the Corps is handed to the Lanterns themselves, some of whom are tasked with watching over the so-called <a href=\"/new-guardians/65-27245/\">New Guardians</a>, super-advanced humans who are intended to be the next step in human evolution. The Guardians return to the main universe after Appa Ali Apsa goes mad and traps <a href=\"/john-stewart/29-10451/\">John Stewart</a> in a nightmarish world of stolen cities. After defeating Apsa, the Guardians announce that they will remain in the main universe and remake the Lantern Corps. The newly-reformed Corps shows itself to be less docile, often questioning and even defying the Guardians' authority on occasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>Emerald Twilight</h3><p> Green Lantern <a href=\"/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a> suffers a great personal tragedy that leaves him susceptible to the influence of the Parallax entity, which had been trapped for eons in the Central Power Battery. He travels to Oa where the Guardians release <a href=\"/sinestro/29-10448/\">Sinestro</a>, who fails to defeat Jordan. The Guardians give their power and energy to one Guardian, <a href=\"/ganthet/29-6951/\">Ganthet</a>, and are subsequently destroyed. Ganthet seeks out <a href=\"/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a>, who becomes the last Green Lantern. Sometime later, Rayner is able to resurrect the Guardians as children. These child Guardians are raised by Rayner, Ganthet and the Zamorans until Ganthet manages to artificially re-age them. They then set about restoring Oa and the Corps.&nbsp;</p><h3>Sinestro Corps War&nbsp;</h3>In response to the threat posed by the <a href=\"/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Sinestro Corps</a>, the Guardians decide to rewrite the <a href=\"/the-book-of-oa/18-56006/\">Book of Oa</a>, authorizing the Lanterns to use lethal force if it is deemed necessary, as well as introducing nine other new laws. They also remove reference to the <a href=\"/blackest-night/39-55766/\">Blackest Night</a> prophecy, a change which is protested by Ganthet and <a href=\"/sayd/29-45697/\">Sayd</a>, who are exiled. The Guardians then travel to Earth, where they appoint <a href=\"/sodam-yat/29-46185/\">Sodam Yat</a> as the new <a href=\"/ion/12-55697/\">Ion</a>. After the war is completed, the Guardians are rejoined by <a href=\"/scar/29-56693/\">Scar</a>.<br /><h3>Blackest Night</h3>The Guardians realize that the <a href=\"/the-war-of-light/12-55769/\">War of Light</a> and the Blackest Night are coming, but are prevented from acting and imprisoned by Scar, who has become infected with evil. The Guardians are revealed to have hidden the fact that life actually began on Earth from the rest of the universe in order to protect the <a href=\"/the-entity/29-69566/\">Entity</a>. They are released from imprisonment after <a href=\"/nekron/29-45745/\">Nekron</a> is defeated. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>Brightest Day &nbsp;</h3>The Guardians return to Oa and retreat from many public duties due to their depleted number and their distress at the loss of faith in them that has been experienced by many Lanterns. They are confronted by <a href=\"/salaak/29-11304/\">Salaak</a>, Rayner and <a href=\"/arisia/29-2046/\">Arisia</a>, and after the Lanterns depart the Guardians decide to repeal the new Third Law. Ganthet returns to them briefly to resign as a Guardian of any Corps, which the Guardians express sadness over. They officially make him the Lantern of Sector 0000. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>War of the Green Lanterns&nbsp;</h3>The Guardians are attacked by Krona, who has them possessed by six of the emotional entities. They are forced to attack Jordan and Gardner, who are travelling to the Central Battery to attempt to remove Parallax from it. They defeat the Lanterns, but allow them to escape after being distracted by the death of <a href=\"/mogo/29-41919/\">Mogo</a>. They are released from their possession by Jordan. The Guardians discharge Jordan from the Corps due to their fear that they would become like Krona if Jordan were allowed to remain. They allow Sinestro to rejoin the Corps. Following a rebellion among the Corps that results in the creation of the \"<a href=\"/new-guardians/65-57179/\">New Guardians</a>,\" the Guardians begin creating the \"Third Army,\" intended to replace the Corps.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Justice League of America: The Nail</h3>The Guardians recall the Corps, less Hal Jordan, to intervene when the war between <a href=\"/apokolips/34-41470/\">Apokolips</a> and <a href=\"/new-genesis/34-41471/\">New Genesis</a> escalates.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Superman &amp; Batman: Generations&nbsp;</h3><a href=\"/alan-scott/29-12663/\">Alan Scott's</a> ring is revealed to have actually been a <a href=\"/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">Green Lantern ring</a>. The weaknesses in the rings are explained as being in the mind of the bearer; the Guardians instilled the weakness to yellow by telling members of the Corps that it was a weakness.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Flashpoint&nbsp;</h3>The Guardians send <a href=\"/abin-sur/29-22634/\">Abin Sur</a> to Earth to locate the Entity. He becomes involved in the <a href=\"/atlantis/34-41030/\">Atlantis</a>/<a href=\"/amazons-of-themyscira/65-42494/\">Amazon</a> War instead, which causes the Guardians to grow impatient. They discharge him from the Corps.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animation</h3><b><i>The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure</i></b>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"325382\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14624/325382-183112-guardians-of-the-uni.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0In the DCAU\"><img id=\"325382\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14624/325382-183112-guardians-of-the-uni_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0In the DCAU\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0In the DCAU</div></div></div></div> \nThe Guardians appear in the Green Lantern guest star episode \"Evil is as Evil Does\".

The time which however is unknown. It was created to be \"the fang that protects the head\". Some of the most dangerous assassins in the DC Universe such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-shiva/29-2222/\">Lady Shiva</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/david-cain/29-10482/\">David Cain</a>, and master archer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/merlyn/29-2532/\">Merlyn</a> have all been members of the League of Assassins.</p><p>Doctor Darrk aka Ebeneezer Darrk, was the first known individual assigned by Ra's al Ghul to head the League of Assassins and seconded by the martial arts master <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sensei/29-19346/\">The Sensei</a> from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hong-kong/34-55799/\">Hong Kong</a>. Darrk relied upon careful planning and manipulation, ambushes and death traps, concealed weapons and poisons, and the League at this time reflected his personal methods, but for many years the League has been filled with some of the greatest martial artist in the DCU. Ra's was never revealed as the leader of the League until Ra's and Darrk had a falling out and Darrk kidnapped Ra's' daughter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/talia/29-4917/\">Talia Al Ghul</a>, and Ra's kidnapped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Robin</a> so that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a> would help him in finding his daughter.

Batman traced Ben Turner to a hospital, foiling a League attempt to assassinate the man. Turner could not fully remember the actions of his alternate personality but he was able to aid Batman in uncovering the Sensei's latest plot. Although Batman was unable to prevent the earthquake, ultimately it was only the Sensei himself that died in the disaster, and control of the League returned to Ra's.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1060280\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/1060280-trin_31_07_super.jpg\" title=\"Shiva\"><img id=\"1060280\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/1060280-trin_31_07_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Shiva\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shiva</div></div></div></div><p>Ra's had grown tired of disloyal servants and ordered David Cain to create a perfect bodyguard (\"The One Who Is All\"). After trying to raise such a person resulted in hopelessly psychotic children, Cain decided that he needed a genetically suited child and began searching for a possible mother. To this end he assassinated <a href=\"/carolyn-woosan/29-36098/\">Carolyn Woosan</a>/Wu-San, one of two astonishingly talented martial artist sisters Carolyn's sister, Sandra, swore revenge and tracked Cain down, only to be subdued by the combined might of the League. However, she was frightened by the levels of skill she was attaining now that she was no longer held back due to her sister; Sandra agreed to be the mother of Cain's child in return, the League spared Sandra's life, and assisted her in further training. By the time Sandra gave birth, she had surpassed the entire League in skill and left immediately following the birth of her daughter, <a href=\"/cassandra-cain/29-65230/\">Cassandra Cain</a>, renamed herself Lady Shiva. The League attempted to train Cassandra from birth to be the ultimate assassin, unknowingly giving her the skills she would use as the hero <a href=\"/batgirl/29-1701/\">Batgirl</a>. After the death of Ra's, his first born daughter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nyssa/29-41476/\">Nyssa Raatko</a> formed a new League. Lady Shiva was recruited to serve as Sensei to this incarnation of the League with the intent that Cassandra would lead the warriors themselves.</p><p>Reflecting Shiva's emphasis for martial arts, the known members of Nyssa's League were all skilled in this area, and included the warriors <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shrike/29-6861/\">Shrike</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-kumbata/29-6793/\">Kitty Kumbata</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wam-wam/29-6795/\">Wam-Wam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joey-nbobo/29-66532/\">Joey N'Bobo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tigris/29-70029/\">Tigris</a>, Momotado, Krunk, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/white-willow/29-70028/\">White Willow</a>, the twin warriors Los Gemelos, Ox, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mad-dog/29-66772/\">\"The Mad Dog\"</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha/29-9647/\">Alpha</a>, and Cristos. The new League was present when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-freeze/29-3715/\">Mr. Freeze</a>'s wife Nora Fries was brought back to life as the monstrous <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lazara/29-50698/\">Lazara</a>, and several members died in the resulting chaos.</p><p>Due to the conflict between their loyalty to Shiva and Nyssa and their near-worship of Batgirl as \"The One Who is All\", the League split at that point, with Ox, <a href=\"/white-willow/29-70028/\">White Willow</a>, and Tigris pledging themselves to Cassandra. Several more members of the League (including all the defectors except Tigris) died when the insane \"Mad Dog\" went on a killing spree. \"The Mad Dog\", it was revealed, had been one of David Cain's early attempts to create Ra's' perfect warrior. The Mad Dog had been considered useless as a child, since Cain's methods had driven him murderously insane, and Ra's had ordered the child be killed. Nyssa, however, knew that the servant ordered to carry out this execution had instead released him into the wild, explaining how it was possible to recruit him. The Mad Dog was successful in killing Batgirl (who gave her life to protect the burqa-clad assassin Tigris). She was quickly restored to life in a Lazarus Pit by Shiva, in order that the two could face each other in a final battle.</p><p>After the <i><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a></i>, the League has been split in two.

        "description":"<h2>Reavers</h2> <p> <strong>Donald Pierce and the Hellfire Club</strong></p> <p>The first of the future Reavers to encounter any of the  X-Men was  <a href=\"/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">                                             Donald Pierce</a>, when he was the White Bishop of the Inner Circle of the  <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">                                            Hellfire Club</a>, who bears  bionic arms and legs. Once, when <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">             Wolverine</a> broke into the Club's Manhattan mansion, he severed Pierce's  cybernetic arm from the rest of his body. Months later, Pierce rebelled against the rest of the Inner Circle, which was dominated by mutants led by Black King  <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">                                           Sebastian Shaw</a>. Pierce abducted Shaw's aide  <a href=\"/sage/29-4559/\">                                          Tessa</a> and held her captive. However, Pierce was thwarted by<a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">                                           Professor Charles Xavier</a> and his new team, the  <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">                                        New Mutants</a>. Tessa regained her freedom, and Pierce was expelled from membership in the Inner Circle. Three other future members of the Reavers, <a href=\"/cole/29-29212/\">                                       Cole</a>, <a href=\"/macon/29-29213/\">                                      Macon</a>, and <a href=\"/reese/29-15710/\">                                     Reese</a>, were formerly mercenaries employed by the Inner Circle. On the same night that he first met Pierce, Wolverine also encountered a squad of Hellfire Club mercenaries who had been sent to find and kill him. Wolverine lashed out at three of them\u2014Cole, Macon, and Reese\u2014with his  <a href=\"/adamantium/18-40759/\">            adamantium</a> claws, leaving the three of them severely wounded. The Inner Circle then had the three men converted into  cyborgs. Cole, Macon, and Reese took Wolverine prisoner when the Inner Circle attacked the  X-Men's Westchester County headquarters months later, but Wolverine overcame the three men once more. They were seen again working directly for Donald Pierce when he rebelled against the rest of the Hellfire Club.</p> <p> <a href=\"/lady-deathstrike/29-8470/\">                                    Lady Deathstrike</a> had herself transformed into a cyborg by the other-dimensional being called  <a href=\"/spiral/29-9722/\">                                   Spiral</a>, in an attempt to gain the means to kill Wolverine, as adamantium had been bonded to his bones in a process stolen from her father,<a href=\"/lord-dark-wind/29-19384/\">                                    Lord Dark Wind</a>. She then led Cole, Macon, and Reese in an unsuccessful attempt to slay Wolverine in  Manhattan. Wolverine was assisted in his escapes by the young  <a href=\"/katie-power/29-2191/\">                                 Katie Power</a>.&nbsp; <br /></p><h2>Creation<br /></h2><p>The Reavers were created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">  Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"/marc-silvestri/26-15688/\"> Marc Silvestri</a> in 1988 and first appeared in Uncanny X-Men # 229.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br /><strong>Australia</strong></p> <p> </p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"539482\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/539482-reavers_00_super.jpg\" title=\"Reavers\"><img id=\"539482\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/539482-reavers_00_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Reavers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Reavers</div></div></div></div>Meanwhile a group of cyborg thieves calling themselves the Reavers had been operating out of a base in Australia. Their base was a  ghost town which was inexplicably equipped with advanced computers and a sub-basement and tunnel system. The Reavers coerced the mutant teleporter <a href=\"/gateway/29-4646/\">                                 Gateway </a>to teleport them from Australia to locations around the world to conduct their violent robberies. Informed of the Reavers' existence by  <a href=\"/roma/29-14810/\">                               Roma</a>, the X-Men expelled them from their Australian base, which they then co-opted for their own use. The X-Men destroyed some of the Reavers and forced most of the rest to enter the  <a href=\"/siege-perilous/18-40957/\">                              Siege Perilous</a>. However, three Reavers (<a href=\"/pretty-boy/29-28113/\">                             Pretty Boy</a>, <a href=\"/skullbuster/29-29211/\">                            Skullbuster</a>, and <a href=\"/bonebreaker/29-28822/\">                           Bonebreaker</a>) escaped. The Reavers were then reassembled under the leadership of Donald Pierce. Pierce combined the three survivors of the original Reavers with Lady Deathstrike and the three former Hellfire Club mercenaries into a formidable team. While the X-Men, whose numbers had dwindled, were away from their Australian base, the Reavers retook the ghost town. When Wolverine returned from a leave of absence in  <a href=\"/madripoor/34-42665/\">                          Madripoor</a> to find the X-Men gone, he was taken by surprise, captured, tortured and crucified by the Reavers. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">                         Psylocke </a>who had a premonition (her sporadic powers of precognition combining with Gateway's Aboriginal dreamtime) of danger waiting in the ghost town, took drastic action to escape when the X-Men were teleported back to the ghost town. Through  telepathic  mind control, she forced the remaining X-Men (herself included) to travel through the  Siege Perilous, barely escaping the approaching Reavers and mystically re-birthing the X-Men elsewhere with no memory of their real lives. Wolverine later escapes the Reavers only with the aid of  <a href=\"/jubilee/29-4562/\">                        Jubilee</a>.  <p>Around this time, in <a href=\"/the-punisher-vol-2/49-3855/\">           Punisher Volume II</a> #33, three Reavers, Bonebreaker, Reese and Pretty Boy, are dispatched to a <a href=\"/new-york-state/34-56310/\">          New York</a> warehouse after  <a href=\"/microchip/29-1526/\">                       Microchip</a>, an associate of the  <a href=\"/punisher/29-1525/\">                      Punisher</a>, in a self-confessed mistake, infiltrates their computer system. The temporary absence of Gateway gives Punisher and Micro enough time to evacuate and set up resistance. One of the Reaver's biggest obstacles is a device designed by Micro, nicknamed  Dalek. Its telescoping guns and multi-directional fire become very difficult to overcome. Even though, Punisher and Microchip barely survive. The Dalek and the warehouse are destroyed and the two escape through the sewer.</p> <p>The Reavers then attacked <a href=\"/muir-island/34-43505/\">                      Muir Island</a>, theorizing that it was Wolverine's most likely destination. During the assault on Muir Island, Skullbuster was rendered inoperative by sniper fire from  <a href=\"/forge/29-4279/\">                    Forge</a>. Donald Pierce later transformed a gravely wounded pilot named <a href=\"/cylla/29-26569/\">                   Cylla Markham</a> into the new Skullbuster (although she usually just went by the name Cylla).<br /><br /> <strong>Upstarts</strong></p> <p> </p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"181279\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181279-15685-reavers_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"181279\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181279-15685-reavers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div>As part of the Upstarts' game, <a href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">                  Trevor Fitzroy</a> dispatches his own Sentinels to the Reavers' Australian hideout to kill Pierce (and anyone else they found there). In the ensuing battle, only Pierce, Lady Deathstrike and Cylla escape the massacre, Pierce seemingly only making it as far as the Hellfire Club before he was \"killed\". Cylla later resurfaces, allying herself with  <a href=\"/bloodscream/29-15734/\">                 Bloodscream </a>in an attempt to murder Wolverine. However, Bloodscream betrayed her and sucked the life from her, killing her.  <p>However, most Reavers somehow survive their supposed deaths. They later return to battle the  X-Treme X-Men on behalf of the  <a href=\"/shadow-king/29-14889/\">                Shadow King</a>.</p> <p>Donald Pierce puts together a new group of Reavers, composed of young anti- mutant humans. This includes <a href=\"/elixir/29-4552/\">                Elixir</a>, who at the time was unaware that he was a mutant. They are defeated by a de-facto new version of the  New Mutants. Pierce himself has the skin decayed from his body by  Wither. He is turned over to the police. Pierce had injured  Wallflower during the battle. Elixir saves her, when his former comrades learn of this, they give him a beating and kick him out of the organization. The group later breaks Pierce out of prison and makes another attempt on Elixir's life, but they are defeated by the surviving core members of the original New Mutants team.<br /><br /> <strong>Messiah Complex</strong></p> <p>The Reavers returned to play a role in the current  Messiah Complex event, under the leadership of Lady Deathstrike. Judging from the design of their costumes, as well as their rhetoric in battle, these newest Reavers are simply existing members of the  Purifiers upgraded with cybernetics rather than classic members of the team. Deployed as an elite commando unit designed to eliminate organized mutant resistance, the Reavers manage to track down and confront Cable in Alberta, Canada before being attacked by the new X-Force. In the ensuing battle, Deathstrike and the Reavers are all terminated by Wolverine's strike team, but not before killing the mutant  Caliban and injuring  Cable. Whether Deathstrike survived the clash, or whether the Purifiers will be able to upgrade more of their fighters with Reaver technology to replace the ones lost in Canada, remains to be seen.</p> <p>&nbsp;<br /></p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><br /><strong>Age of Apocalypse</strong></p> <p>The Reavers in this alternate reality were headed by Donald Pierce and made up of members <a href=\"/clegg/29-41007/\">       Clegg</a>, <a href=\"/dead-eye/29-61370/\">      Dead Eye</a>, Mangle, Slocum, and Vultura. They were human beings that were altered by Apocalypse with the Techno-Organic Virus. Put in charge of stopping the Human High Council's plan to use nuclear weapons to stop Apocalypse, they brainwashed <a href=\"/captain-britain/29-7477/\">         Captain Britain</a> and attacked Wolverine, <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">        Carol Danvers</a>, and Gateway. Eventually, all of their members were defeated.<br /><br /> <strong>Ultimate Reavers</strong></p> <p>Rather than being a specific team of super-villains, the  Ultimate continuity's version of the Reavers are human  gladiators who have undergone surgery to become cyborgs for the specific purpose of hunting down mutants on live television. They are led by  Ultimate <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">     Deadpool</a>. Some do retain the names of the 616 Reavers, such as 'Bonebreaker'.</p> <p><br /><br /></p>",

The Upstarts included:  <a href=\"/shinobi-shaw/29-9704/\">            Shinobi Shaw</a>, <a href=\"/siena-blaze/29-14865/\">            Siena Blaze</a>, <a href=\"/fabian-cortez/29-9728/\">            Fabian Cortez</a>, <a href=\"/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">            Graydon Creed</a>, <a href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">            Trevor Fitzroy</a> and the&nbsp;  <a href=\"/fenris/65-56925/\">      Fenris</a> Twins, <a href=\"/andrea-strucker/29-4814/\">            Andrea Strucker</a> and <a href=\"/andreas-strucker/29-4815/\">            Andreas Strucker</a>. The Upstarts were responsible for most of the death's of the original <a href=\"/hellions/65-3199/\">            Hellions</a> and the apparent deaths of <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">            Magneto</a> and <a href=\"/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">            Sebastian Shaw</a>. <h2>The Upstarts!</h2><p>Many members of the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">            Hellfire Club</a>'s <a href=\"/inner-circle/65-57190/\">            The Inner Circle</a> have had their hands in the creation of many power teams. These teams were used to further the creator\u2019s power. <a href=\"/selene/29-2176/\">            Selene</a> (the Black Queen of the Inner Circle) would be no different. As the White Queen (<a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">            Emma Frost</a>) made a team of young/adolescent mutants, called the Hellions, to solidify her role in the Hellfire Club. Selene, too, would create a team of young, mutant adults though for, it would seem, more honorable reasons. Selene was to use the team to mold and create the future mutant leaders of the world. Though with Selene, there is always more then meets the eye. Selene would have an ulterior motive for the team know as The Upstarts!</p><a> </a><h2>The Players</h2><p>Selene was very particular about those that she would recruit into the team. Only wanting the young, wealthy, powerful and elite. Those who would be powerful leaders in the future. Her only other criteria would be that they MUST be mutants. </p><p>The initial roster would include:</p><p>__<a href=\"/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">            Trevor Fitzroy</a>__: The teleporting, time traveling mutant from the future.</p><p>__<a href=\"/shinobi-shaw/29-9704/\">            Shinobi Shaw</a>__: The phasing son of the Inner Circle's Black King, Sebastion Shaw. Cunning and sly, Shinobi Shaw is willing to betray and do anything in order to further his self. </p><p>Other would join later in the game such as:</p><p>__<a href=\"/siena-blaze/29-14865/\">            Siena Blaze</a>__: wielding energies so powerful, each use depleted Earth further as her power were detrimental to the environment.</p><p>__<a href=\"/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">            Graydon Creed</a>(Tribune)__: the only baseline human, and future presidential candidate, to join the team also the mutant hating biological son of both <a href=\"/mystique/29-1469/\">            Mystique</a> and <a href=\"/sabretooth/29-4563/\">            Sabretooth</a>.</p><p>__<a href=\"/fenris/29-23530/\">            Fenris</a>__: Twin Nazi sympathizers who require skin-to-skin contact with each other to enable use of their powers. (Probationary Member)</p><p>__<a href=\"/matsuo-tsurayaba/29-15117/\">            Matsuo Tsurayaba</a>__: powerful member of <a href=\"/the-hand/65-1800/\">            The Hand</a>. (Probationary Member)</p><p>The team would need one last person, someone who could monitor and judge the competitions for the group, a referee of sorts. Selene would get in contact with an omnipathic mutant, with mental powers on par with both <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">            Professor X</a> and <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">            Jean Grey</a>, by name of <a href=\"/gamesmaster/29-14866/\">            Gamesmaster</a>. Though Selene organized/founded the team, he would monitor them and keep track of points to see who the winner of each game would be.</p><p>The Upstarts were unlike any other team. In joining the team each member was part of a secret competition, or games as they are referred to as being. Basically the group would be given targets (groups of people or individuals) and the Upstarts would have to assassinate them. Gamesmaster would award points based on the victim\u2019s power, skill and their overall importance to the world. Points and competition were decided solely by Gamesmaster. The winner for smaller games would gain leadership of the Upstarts with complete loyalty and power granted to that person while they were wearing \"the ring.\" The ring signifies who the winner was. Selene also eluded that the grand prize would be immortality, a prize that each member wanted greatly. </p><p>In order to join the team one requirement must be met. The individual requesting membership would have to kill a member of the Inner Circle. In the beginning, things went smoothly and as planned. Resulting in many major events such as: The decimation and deaths of almost all of the Hellions as well as the <a href=\"/reavers/65-9726/\">            Reavers</a>. Additionally, the apparent deaths of Sebastion Shaw (Black King), Emma Frost (White Queen), Eric Lensherr (Magneto/ White King) &amp; <a href=\"/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">            Donald Pierce</a> (White Rook). Selene's hidden agenda couldn't be going any better.</p><a> </a><h2>Selene's Secret Plan</h2><p>In appearance, <a href=\"/selene/29-2176/\">           Selene</a> would make it seem as though her reasoning for the team was completely honorable. Only wanting to find and mold the future mutant leaders of the world. A humanitarian effort if ever there was one. Though not all was as it seemed. True, she did want to find the future leaders, but this would be to fit her needs. There was a power struggle, one of huge proportions, in one of the most powerful factions in the world. It was in the Inner Circle of the Hellfire Club. Each of the members was plotting against one another. Deception, lies and manipulation; these were a regular thing and was what was to be expected. Selene, the Black Queen of the Inner Circle would be no different.</p><p>Her goal was simple, she wanted full control of the Inner Circle and in effect the Hellfire Club. This would never happen with the current members as they all wanted the same exact thing. So she would pick individuals with the powers and abilities to assassinate/kill those currently in the Inner Circle. She would sugar-coat the actions by calling it a competition or game. With each completed game another part of the Inner Circle would be removed, from the actual members to their followers. This would only leave Selene to be in the fullest control of the group. Here are some of the initial games.<br /></p><p>-Payment for membership would be to kill one of the current members of the Inner Circle.</p><p>-Destroy any of the personal teams the Inner circles may have. i.e. the Reaver's who were the followers of Donald Pierce (White Rook).</p><p>-Kill the Hellions, loyal to Emma Frost the White Queen, and potential Inner Circle recruits in the future.</p><p>-The total annihilation of the entire group of the Inner Circle, excluding Selene.</p><p>If the ploy was successful there would only be the Black Queen, Selene, with all the power to herself. She would then have her team fill the emptied spot to create a new Inner Circle. Though as it would shortly be seen, Selene wasn't the only one playing a game for their own benefit. One, of the Upstarts would soon have plans of his own, that none were aware of. And there wasn't a thing anyone could do to stop him.</p> <br /><a> </a><h2>The Gamesmaster</h2><p>The <a href=\"/gamesmaster/29-14866/\">          Gamesmaster'</a>s role was to be the quiet background member. He was only to be the referee with no other real role on the team. In actuality he was getting taken advantage of by Selene, only wanting him for his mental powers, powers that she would underestimate. Gamesmaster was no regular telepath, he was an omnipath with mental gifts so powerful any average telepath's mind would burn out. His mental powers were at such a level that he is linked/connected to every single mind on the world 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. More then 6 million people's thoughts coursing through his mind all at one time. Even the powerful Professor X would not withstand that duress. He would find ease when he was asked to join the Upstarts. He found that when focusing on specific sets on individuals, rather then trying to block everyone\u2019s thoughts, it would ease his pain. Gamesmaster enjoyed the games, he found the interesting, and especially liked the reprieve from the pain of his powers. The problem was that Selene's game was soon to end, and the game would be over. Or so she thought.<br /></p><br /><p><br /></p> <a> </a><h2>The Gamesmaster's Game</h2><p>Selene No More</p><p>The Gamesmaster couldn't allow the games to end; he enjoyed them, to make them continue he would have to do a little manipulating, himself. Gamesmaster would have to use his powers in a way that he had never tried. He would have to mentally control another person to put his plans into play. Considering his amazing telepathic might, it shouldn't be a problem. He would select the maniacal Fitzroy. While Controlling Fitzroy he would have him use his powers to capture Selene. Fitzroy would prove successful and even put her in a torture machine from the future. All her experiences in her long life, battling some of the most powerful heroes from the X-Men and Excalibur, while all ranging from life threatening to simply casting a spell, they have not prepared her for such physical pain. Otherwise known as \u201cspooling\u201d the process involves being ripped to shreds and then reformed over and over and over again. Needless to say the pain was exquisite. Fitzroy fail-proofed his plan as well. The only way she could be freed is if someone took her place in the machine. No one in there right mind would do that, so Selene would be stuck their. Gamesmaster also fail-proofed his plan. If Selene, by chance, did free herself, she would blame Fitzroy, not the true person behind it. Once Selene was out of the way, Gamesmaster could use the Upstarts to his hearts content. He would control them and their lives like a game of chess. He would never have to worry of ramifications either, as he would never have physical contact with the teams either, since all connections with them would be through the astral plane. It was the perfect plan.</p><br /><h2>Let The New Games Begin!</h2><p>Gamesmaster would now play an even larger role in the Upstarts. No longer simply a referee, he was participating in the games by manipulating and controlling his team. When he took over, new members would join like: Tribune (Graydon Creed), Fenris and Matsu'o from The Hand.</p><p>The games that he created were one the same path as those in the beginning. He would select target and this Upstarts would have to assassinate them for points. He picked some very hard targets and in most cases not successful at his attempts. Some of the targets were <a href=\"/forge/29-4279/\">            Forge</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">            Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">            Storm</a>, <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">            Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">            Moira MacTaggert</a> and in one a death wasn't required. <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">            Mr. Sinister</a> hired the team to attain D.N.A. from <a href=\"/proteus/29-2165/\">            Proteus</a> instead return with the D.N.A. of <a href=\"/marvel-girl/29-3566/\">            Marvel Girl</a> (Rachel Summers, then using Phoenix as her code-name.) Gamesmaster had many games, some time multiple one at any given time. None would require more effort from him and his team the Upstarts, then the final one that they would participate in together.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------       </p><a> </a><h2>Young Hunt / Child's Play</h2><p>Coming full circle Gamesmaster would have his final targets be the ones that got away in the very first game. The new/old target are the remaining living original <a href=\"/hellions/65-3199/\">            Hellions</a> and <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">            New Mutants</a> (in actuality all the remaining living New Mutants, save a few were all Hellions). Though now, these are no longer young, novice mutants who could get easily pushed over. Both teams are older, more experienced and are very spread out. They are all spread out out now and apart of different teams such as: <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">            X-Force</a>, <a href=\"/mutant-liberation-front/65-28349/\">            Mutant Liberation Front</a> (MLF) and <a href=\"/new-warriors/65-11896/\">            New Warriors</a>. There were quite a few targets that the members of the Upstarts were to take on, including: <a href=\"/empath/29-2173/\">            Empath</a>, Thunderbird(now known as <a href=\"/warpath/29-2158/\">            Warpath</a>), <a href=\"/firestar/29-2101/\">            Firestar</a>, <a href=\"/magma/29-4558/\">            Magma</a>, <a href=\"/cannonball/29-1496/\">            Cannonball</a>, <a href=\"/boom-boom/29-2159/\">            Boom Boom</a>, <a href=\"/karma/29-9849/\">            Karma</a>, <a href=\"/moonstar/29-1463/\">            Moonstar</a>, <a href=\"/rictor/29-10988/\">            Rictor</a> and <a href=\"/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">            Wolfsbane</a>. The key difference in this game is that Gamesmaster didn't want the captives to be killed, only captured.  It can only be assumed that he grew bored with the Upstarts and was to use the captives mutants as his new pawns. His ploy was nearly successful and would have won if not for one, Paige Guthrie, the future <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">            X-Men</a> known as <a href=\"/husk/29-3426/\">            Husk</a> and little sister of Cannonball.</p><a> </a><h2>The New Game</h2><p>To Control The Future</p><p>Gamesmaster was always ready for a new challenging game, especially the one posed to him. Paige challenged the Gamesmaster to a race. A race to locate and control the future mutants of the world. She stated that Professor X, Magneto and the Hellfire Club would all be trying to find them as well. Being intrigued by the challenge, he quickly decides that he no longer had interest in the Young Hunt. He called the game off and released all his mentally captives ex-member's of the New Mutants and the Hellions. Not only would he call and end to the current game but he would follow that with the disbanding of the Upstarts. He felt that he no longer required them as he could continue his game alone.</p><a> </a><h2>Where Are They Now</h2><p>It not likely that the Upstarts are to regroup and make an appearance. Many have passed away, unfortunately have this status be much more permanent the some of the \"death\" that they dealt out on their targets. Here is an update on the status' of each of the members.</p><p>Selene: is still actively scheming away hiding in the dark. She recently came into the company of the young mutant Wither and has plans in place for the both of them. Though nothing has been revealed about it.</p><p>Gamesmaster: After the Upstarts were disbanded, he would show up a few more times doing battle with the likes of both the X-Men and X-Force. After a lose at the hands of Jean Grey he seemingly disappeared. Though being that he is a telepath of high order, he may simply be hiding his presence till the right time.</p><p>Trevor Fitzroy: Though he would continue to wreak havok for many years to come he would finally run into his enemy from the future, Bishop, and be dispatched. It appears that his death is a permanent one.</p><p>Siena Blaze: Though she had immeasurable and deadly mutant energies at her disposal, in the end it wouldn't matter. She along with hundreds of other mutants would be captured and sent to Neverland, a facility ran by Weapon X. She would ultimately be placed in a gas chamber and be killed. Her power's would matter not as the building was harnessing the power dampening mutant Leech's powers to effectively depower all mutants in the vicinity.</p><p>Shinobi Shaw: Though he thought he was successful in his ploy to kill his father, he would be wrong. His father would reappear, very much, alive. Scared for his father retribution, Shinobi went into hiding and has yet to come out.</p><p>Fabian Cortez: Would attempt multiply time to kill Magneto, his one time savior. He was first attacked and thought to be killed by another of Magneto's over-zealous followers, Exodus. Though, truly he was alive, Magneto would find him and put an end to his life.</p><p>Graydon Creed: He would go as far a being a candidate for presidency, while giving a speech his very own mother, Mystique, would assassinate him. </p><p>Fenris: Of the two of them, Andrea and Andreas, only one would not meet their death. Andrea would, by chance, deduce the identity of a newly arrived Citizen V. Not wanting his secret out he would murder her in cold blood, ensuring his secret would be safe. A mind controlled Andreas, would find her body and show no real emotion, but would slice some of her skin off and have it added to the sword that he was carrying. He would have the skin tanned and added to the hilt of his sword so that he could maintain his power's which require skin contact with his sister and he would also take the role of the Swordsman working for the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">         Thunderbolts</a>. </p><a> </a><h2>Creators</h2><p>The Upstarts were created by both <a href=\"/jim-lee/26-2399/\">            Jim Lee</a> &amp; <a href=\"/whilce-portacio/26-6024/\">            Whilce Portacio</a>.</p>",

When Magneto granted them refuge within his headquarters on <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Asteroid M</a>, they left Fabian out in the cold and reformed as Acolytes under Magneto. But Fabian was incensed: before escaping Asteroid M, he helped bring about its destruction. When Asteroid M plummeted to Earth, the Acolytes perished and only Magneto survived.</p><p>Fabian Cortez was then free to lead a second incarnation of Acolytes whose first mission involved an attack on Our Mother of the Sacred Hear School to search for a child they hoped would become a powerful mutant in his adolescence. Once the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> stepped in, the Acolytes released the child - but only after finding out the boy had Down\u00b4s syndrome, which made him untrainable in the eyes of Acolytes. After the brutal killing of dying humans in the Sacred Heart School and an aborted attack on a military base, Magneto returned. Magneto, who was angry about Cortez\u00b4s betrayal, found and recruited the mutant known as <a href=\"/exodus/29-4567/\">Exodus</a> to help him reclaim the Acolytes. After winning the leadership from Cortez, Magneto returned to space and build a new space station called the <a href=\"/avalon/34-41283/\">Avalon</a> for the group with <a href=\"/shiar-empire/34-23199/\">Shi\u00b4ar</a> technology.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"737456\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35698/737456-414px_avalon_001_super.jpg\" title=\"Avalon\"><img id=\"737456\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35698/737456-414px_avalon_001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avalon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avalon</div></div></div></div><p>When Exodus retreated to Avalon, he and the other Acolytes noticed a floating cocoon in outer space and brought it onboard. The cocoon housed the dimensionally displaced mutant called <a href=\"/holocaust/29-15071/\">Holocaust</a> who after he awakening killed several Acolytes.

        "description":"<p>The Iron Rebirth</p><p>=================</p><p><a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> following the death of the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> at the hands of the <a href=\"/absorbing-man/29-1779/\">Absorbing Man</a> in Washington D.C., created robot duplicates of his fallen teammates to carry on in their name. Lead by the <a href=\"/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>, they were first sent to battle the alien hybrid \"the Hydra\"</p><p>When the Skull first arrived in New York City, the Iron Avengers were the first line of defense against the Skulls army against President Norman Osborne's headquarters. When the Skull found he couldn't take control of the Iron Avengers he had his army destroy them, which they did with great ease.</p><p>Following the death of the Skull, and Tony Stark's death while fighting the <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a>, <a href=\"/king-britain/29-10987/\">King Britain</a> (Brian Braddock) ordered that the Iron Avengers to be rebuilt. Over a three year period he worked with the Vision and his army of genetically altered Union Jacks to build an army of Iron Avengers to defend England and the Earth. While maintaining the same abilities of the originals, these Iron Avengers lacked the personalities of the Avengers the original Iron Avengers; as well as lacking ability to speak that the originals did. This may be because that only Stark had the genius and knowledge of his friends while they lived to program such complex personalities.</p><h2>Defending a strange new world</h2><p>This new army of Iron Avengers were now lead by the Black Knight (the son of Black Bolt, raised by Braddock) defended Buckingham Palace from an attack made by the Tong of Creel, who were searching for the broken pieces of the Absorbing man. One of those pieces were guarded by King Britain in an attempt to keep the absorbing man from reforming, the battle was lost when the Tong of Creel obtained the piece they had sought.</p><p>Later the Iron Avengers were sent with Black Knight to investigate one of the Human Torches in the <a href=\"/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a> that appeared to have gone out because of neglect. While there <a href=\"/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, <a href=\"/iron-maiden/29-10968/\">Iron Maiden</a>, and <a href=\"/jade-dragon/29-10956/\">Jade Dragon</a> joined in a great struggle with <a href=\"/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a>, who switched abilities with <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> following the worlds depolarization. The Toad used his new found magnetic powers to both abuse magneto for the years of torment his former boss had dealt to him and to take control of the Iron Avengers and used them to attack the heroes. At which point Black Bolt called in an entire army of Iron Avengers against Toad, and his robotic creation known only as Tank.</p><p>With the help of <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a> (having been trapped beneath Sentinel City since the techno-organic virus that had consumed his body went out of control, having lost his telepathic powers when the rest of the telepaths lost their powers or died), Iron Maiden was able to stabilize the amount of Vibranium in that area of the world to reverse the power switch between Magneto and Toad . Upon regaining his powers Magneto repaired all the damage caused to Sentinel City and the Iron Avengers were free from the Toad's control.</p><p>The Iron Avengers later aided in battling the Absorbing Man when he literally absorbed the city of New York.</p><p>After the defeat of Absorbing Man ,the Iron Avengers have taken an even lesser involvement in the affairs on this universes' Earth. They have been seen as guards during the wedding ceremony of King Britain and <a href=\"/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>. A number of Iron Avengers were sent along with the Iron Maiden into space on a rescue mission to save the <a href=\"/eternals/65-13344/\">Eternals</a>, who were trapped in Vibranium .</p><p>Presently, it has never been revealed what the status of this mission is, and what the remaining Iron Avenger status are on Earth, but it is reasonable to assumable they have resumed their normal duties of defending as the global police force Tony Stark originally intended them for.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Each Iron Avenger had a similar likeness of their name sake, but also had similar features of Stark's many Iron Man armors. Each robotic construct could fly via jet boots, although the size differences of the <a href=\"/sting/29-14437/\">Sting</a> and <a href=\"/monolith/29-25741/\">Monolith</a> , and the <a href=\"/steelbow/29-24836/\">Steelbows'</a> bow and arrows, it is unclear if the Iron Avengers were given the ability to mimic their name sakes super-human abilities.</p>",

Green Martians</h2><p>Eons ago the evil Pale or \"White Martians\" invaded Earth. Without really caring for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a> the White Martians brought destruction to Earth's environment. Besides the Mars inhabitants containing the White Martians there was also the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-martians/65-30878/\">Green Martians</a>, a more peaceful race of martians. The White Martians rampage on Earth resulted in the slow down of superhuman evolution. Taking matters into their own hands the Green Martians imprisoned their counterparts in the Ghost Zone (also known as the Still Zone or <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a>) for what they thought to be forever. But, eventually all the badies come back and the White Martians were no exception. After the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League Of America</a> defeated the White Martians initial invasion lead by the Hyperclan, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martian-manhunter/29-2047/\">Martian Manhunter</a> wiped them of all their previous memories making them think that were and had always been only human. In an encounter with the wish-granting Id J'onn J'onnz (the Martian Manhunter) inadvertently resummoned his fellow martians through a wish she granted for him of wanting company.</p><h2>The Hyperclan</h2><p>Extricating themselves from the Still Zone aka Ghost Zone or Phantom Zone, the White Martians returned to Earth in the guise of gods calling themselves the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hyperclan/65-24524/\">Hyperclan</a>. The Martians claimed their homeworld had been destroyed by negligence and greed and they offered to save Earth from a similar fate. The Hyperclan turned deserts into verdant paradises and ended crime by executing meta-criminals. This was all part of their insidious plan to discredit and destroy the Justice League. Earth's real heroes saw through this ruse and put a stop to it right away. All hope seemed lost after the White Martians took away the only means of defeating them, by burning them with fire. The Martians took this away from Earth by inhibiting the Earth's atmosphere with subatomic particles that inhibited any combustible reaction. To find a way around this the Justice Leagues lured the Martians to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-watchtower/34-41469/\">Justice League Watchtower</a> and the moon aflame.</p><h2>Fernus</h2><p>After the events of the Obsidian Age, the Martian Manhunter sought out therapeutic help against his otherwise crippling fear of fire that affects all Martians. Mostly conquering this fear with the aid of the reforming criminal <a href=\"/scorch/29-9054/\">Scorch</a>, J'onn however unlocked a personality buried within himself called <a href=\"/fernus/29-73044/\">Fernus</a>, a personality that was only kept in check through the Martians racial fear of fire. Unknown to all, save the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians of the Universe</a>, the Martian race had once been a single race, called the Burning. The Guardians feared the Burning, at the time limited to Mars, would achieve interstellar flight and spread beyond Mars and inflict the rest of the cosmos with their chaos, as the Burning could reproduce asexual as long as they could find a proper flame. The Guardians found it necessary to descended on Mars and the Burning, breaking the Martians down into two species resulting in the Green and the White Martians and creating their great fear of fire to prevent their Burning mentality from returning, something they were unable to completely remove.</p><p>When J'onn finally lost himself inside Fernus, the White Martians held in the Still Zone were amongst the first to suffer his ire and as a result, they were all butchered before the League arrived.</p><h2>Miss Martian</h2><p>Despite what Fernus did, it was not the end of the White Martian race. During the One Year Later gap, the Teen Titans recruited a young woman that looked very much like the Martian Manhunter called <a href=\"/miss-martian/29-41145/\">M'gann M'orzz</a>, however like many that year, Megan didn't remain for long due to the turmoil the team was in at the time. After Cyborg returned and woke up with the knowledge that Raven had uncovered a traitor during the year he was out and was now on the run, the team ventured to the Australian Outback to meet with Megan before being pointing them at Bombshell after refusing to expose her mind to the world. After the Titans had left however she did anyways and discovered that Bombshell was the traitor and headed after them. Initially there was confusion when Bombshell blasted Megan out of her Green Martian guise, revealing that she was in fact a White Martian. Because of the White Martians dire reputation the Titans initially thought Megan was the traitor before being blindsided by Bombshell.</p><p>Megan has since then revealed that her parents had sent her into the Vegan system when she was an infant to shield her from the wars plaguing their people, but when she came back they were gone and she headed to Earth. It is only known that she has met J'onn in person once, during the Brightest Day when she was ambushed and nearly slain in her Outback retreat by the insane Green Martian called <a href=\"/dkay-drazz/29-74020/\">D'kay</a> before J'onn arrived.</p><h2>Pale/White Martian Abilities</h2><p>Can project beams of energy from their eyes</p><p>Self Propelled Flight</p><p>Nearly Immeasurable Strength</p><p>Super-Speed</p><p>Telepathy. After escaping from captivity, the White Martians stole brain matter from latent human telepaths in order to mutate and multiply their own telepathic powers.</p><p>And their most infamous ability Shape-Shifting, used to blend in and to fool the people of Earth</p>",

        "description":"<h2>History</h2><p>At the beginning of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree-skrull-war/39-55742/\">Kree-Skrull War</a>, millions of years ago in <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a> time, the alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a> established a station on the planet <a href=\"/uranus/34-56295/\">Uranus</a>, a strategic position between the Kree and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull</a> empires. Through their work at this station, they discovered that sentient life on nearby Earth had genetic potential invested in it by the alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a>. Intrigued, the Kree began to experiment on Earth's then primitive Homo Sapiens, inspired from studying a dead <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eternals/65-13344/\">Eternal</a>.</p><p>Their goal was apparently twofold \u2014 to investigate possible ways of circumventing their own evolutionary stagnation, and to create a powerful mutant race of soldiers for use against the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a>. However, although their experiments were successful in creating a strain of humanity with extraordinary abilities, the Kree abandoned their experiment for reasons which are not yet clear.</p><p>Their test subjects, the Inhumans, went on to form a society of their own, which thrived in seclusion from the rest of humanity and developed advanced technology. Experiments with the mutagenic Terrigen Mist gave them various powers, but also caused lasting genetic damage and deformities. This led to a long-term selective breeding program to try to mitigate the effects of these mutations. Their city <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/attilan/34-44155/\">Attilan</a> has frequently been relocated and, as of 2005 stories, rests in the oxygen-bearing Blue Area of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-moon/34-42072/\">Moon</a>.</p><p>The once-secret existence of the race has come to light among the general public as the Inhumans interact more often with many of Earth's superheroes \u2014 including the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">the Avengers</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> \u2014 whom they have aided against threats such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron 7</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>.</p><p>The Inhumans are led by their king, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, and his royal family, consisting of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karnak/29-10975/\">Karnak</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gorgon/29-4330/\">Gorgon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/triton/29-11428/\">Triton</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maximus/29-3447/\">Maximus the Mad</a>, and the canine <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lockjaw/29-3534/\">Lockjaw</a>. Both Crystal and Medusa have been members of the Fantastic Four; Crystal has also been a member of the Avengers.</p><p>One interesting observation is that Attilan's society and culture are predicated on a conformist belief system which permits individuality as it applies to genetic development and physical and mental ability, but demands rigid conformity in that each member of society is assigned a place within that society according to those abilities following exposure to the Terrigen Mist. Once assigned, no Inhuman, no matter how great or powerful can change their place within this rigid caste system.</p><p>Another interesting note is that the Inhumans' culture strictly prohibits miscegenation, or racial combining, between Inhumans and other races. Although a member of the royal family, the Inhuman Crystal appears to have ignored this prohibition married outside of her caste to wed the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a>. However, this may be a privilege due to Crystal's standing as a member of the royal family.</p><p>In contrast it appears that such permissive behavior is lost on the children of the immediate members of the royal family. Gorgon's daughter, for example, attempted to form relationships outside of her caste and was strictly prohibited from doing so, although this may have been because her relationship was with an Alpha Primitive, a cloned creature with subhuman intellect bred for labor, the lowest Inhuman caste. It is not clear, however, whether commoners face such strict disciplinary measures under similar circumstances.</p><p>During their stay in Attilan on the moon, a group of Kree refuges arrived and was attacked by the Inhuman guards. When one of the Inhuman guards was outnumbered the Kree told him they came to beg for Sanctuary. This was a lie they said so they could get close to the Inhuman Royal Family and assassinate them. The Kree had found Medusa and Black Bolt playing in a garden since they renounced their monarchy and let Attilan decide for themselves. The Kree stayed in a part of Attilan which held old Kree machinery, in tents. Three Inhuman kids came here to play but saw three Kree soldiers. Having a dislike towards Kree they tried to scare them. One of the Kree children got a gun and shot one of the Inhumans in the leg. And then tried to shoot an Inhuman guard who was invincible. During this time in the Chambers of the Inhuman Genetics Council, the Kree was granted an open hearing to decide whether their sanctuary in the Blue Area is to be permanent or temporary. In the end the Inhumans sent the Kree away.</p><p>However, Inhuman society changed radically recently. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan the Accuser</a> sought to use the Inhumans as an army to disrupt the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/12-43138/\">Shi'ar</a> control of the Kree after their defeat in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/operation-galactic-storm/39-27758/\">Kree-Shi'ar War</a>. Appearing over the city of Attilan, Ronan seized control in a surprise attack and forced the Inhumans and their king, Black Bolt, to obey, or he would destroy their only home and everyone in it. During their time in forced servitude, Ronan revealed that the Inhumans had always been intended as weapons in service to the Kree. To this end, much of the genetic attributes that were encoded in them during the original experiments were meant to give them the abilities and appearances of various alien races. The idea being that these Inhuman slaves could be used to infiltrate alien worlds and races to conduct espionage or assassinations to weaken potential conquests. Ronan used the Inhumans in just this manner, disrupting treaties being negotiated by the Shi'ar, and launching attacks on ships and bases. Eventually, Black Bolt sought to free his people by challenging Ronan to a personal battle. If Ronan won, the Inhumans would continue to serve him. If the king won, the Inhumans would go free. After a terrible battle, Black Bolt won and Ronan, demonstrating that the Kree still had honor, kept his word and left the Inhumans. All was not over however, as the Inhumans were not willing to just follow Black Bolt back to Earth. Pressure had been building in the closed society of Attilan since open contact with the outside world had been made. During their enslavement by Ronan, the Inhumans had wished for their freedom, but had also developed a sense of pride in their power and a belief in their own destiny. They no longer believed that Black Bolt or the royal family was fit to lead them in the new life they wanted, and they exiled the royal family from Attilan. The royal family returned to Earth to find their destiny. After suffering bigotry and living in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a>, they returned to Attilan which was located on the Blue Area of the Moon. The Inhumans are currently fostering better relations with Earth by sending students to a Wisconsin University.</p><p>In the events of Son of M, Quicksilver stole the Terrigen Crystals in an attempt to give himself back his powers, and to give back the depowered mutants from M-Day their powers. The theft led to a conflict on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a> between the repowered mutants (whose powers came back as too powerful for their own good, and eventually surrendered), the Inhumans, and the U.S. Office of National Emergency. The conflict ended with the O.N.E. confiscating the Terrigen crystals, to which <i>Black Bolt then verbally declared war on the United States</i>.</p><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a> the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> went up to the moon to get away from it all there he encountered the Inhumans. Nobody remembered their previous encounters but were intrigued by it. They allowed him to stay but in the end left with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> leaving Crystal with questions about their time together.</p><p>In the Illuminati Black Bolt was discovered as a Skrull. It is believed that this Black Bolt was the same who fought an enraged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> (see: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/world-war-hulk/39-42294/\">World War Hulk</a>) and lost.</p><h3><b>Secret Invasion</b></h3><p>After learning about Black Bolt's disappearance, Medusa confronts Ironman and Ironman tells her that Black Bolt was kidnapped by Skrulls. This prompts Medusa to leave Ironman and take the Skrull that was posing as Black Bolt and presented the new Skrull invasion threat to the Inhuman Council. The Skrulls sprung their trap on the Inhumans and ravaged their city and Medusa acts and leads the Royal Family to steal the Skrulls spacecraft and leave Attilan to gain help from the Inhumans old master's, the Kree. Meanwhile on the ship that Black Bolt is held captive at, they tell him that they captured him because they intend to use his voice as a weapon and obliterate Attilan.</p><p>After Medusa makes a pact with Ronan the Accuser, they embark on a quest to find out where the Skrull ship is headed and must split up into three groups to do everything they have to simultaneously. Meanwhile, it is learned that Ahura, Black Bolt and Medusa's son, has also been taken captive by the Skrulls to use as leverage if Black Bolt does not do what they say. After the Inhumans complete their tasks they prep up for an assault on the Skrull ship that has Black Bolt. As the fight begins, Black Bolt tells Ahura to go to Ry'bik (the Skrull scientist) and control his mind to let Black Bolt free and as this happens, Black Bolt kills Ry'bik and the Skrull lady takes Ahura captive in attempt to bargain Black Bolt his life for hers but Medusa kills her as she finds Black Bolt.</p><p>The Royal Family return home and tell the Inhumans that they will return to their roots and go to the Kree who shall rule them.</p><p>After Black Bolt's death during his battle with Vulcan at the end of the War of Kings, Medusa took control of the monarchy and now rules in his place.</p><h2>Universal Inhumans</h2><p>It was a long held Inhuman secret that the Kree experimented on not only the human race but four other species as well. Known as the Universal Inhumans, they all were created to reignite the evolution of the Kree race and implanted with a genetic memory that would unite them together. The memory claims that the five queens will join the one king who returns from the forever night and band together in a new holy land which will be known as New Hala.</p><h3>Races</h3><p>Along with the humans of Earth, the Kree also experimented on the <a href=\"/alpha-centaurians/65-56555/\">Alpha Centaurians</a>, the <a href=\"/badoon/65-22907/\">Badoon</a>, the <a href=\"/kymellians/65-52945/\">Kymellians</a> and the <a href=\"/dire-wraiths/65-14015/\">Dire Wraiths</a>. All are led by a queen.</p><h3>Catalysts</h3><p>Terrigenesis - exposure to the mist of the Terrigen Crystals. Created the Inhumans of Earth.</p><p>Isogenesis - injection of the extract of the Isogen Orbs</p><p>Amphogenesis - one drop of diluted water of the dormant Amphogen</p><p>Antigenesis - eating the nectar of the Nightblooms of the Anitgen Tree</p><p>Exogenesis - inhaling the Exogen Spice</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Even without using the Terrigen Mist, the Kree modifications, combined with centuries of selective breeding, have given all Inhumans certain advantages. Their average lifespan is 150 years and an Inhuman in good physical condition possesses strength, reaction time, speed, and endurance greater than the finest of human athletes. Karnak and other normal Inhumans who are in excellent physical shape can lift one ton and are physically slightly superior to the peak of normal human physical achievement. However, most Inhumans are used to living in a pollution-free, germ-free environment and have difficulty tolerating Earth's current level of air and water pollution for any length of time. Exposure to the Terrigen Mist can both enhance and in some cases reduce these physical capabilities.</p><p><b>Inhuman Royal Family (Earth):</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>: King of the Inhumans.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa</a>: Queen of the Inhumans.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a>: Medusa's Sister.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gorgon/29-4330/\">Gorgon</a>:Cousin of Medusa and Black Bolt.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karnak/29-10975/\">Karnak</a>: Cousin of Black Bolt.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luna/29-10962/\">Luna</a>: Daughter of Crystal and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lockjaw/29-3534/\">Lockjaw</a>: Transporter of the family.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/triton/29-11428/\">Triton</a>: Cousin of Black Bolt and Brother to Karnak.</p><h2>Alternate Realities:</h2><h3>Earth-295 - Age of apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1732564\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1732564-inhumans_super.jpg\" title=\"Age of apocalypse\"><img id=\"1732564\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1732564-inhumans_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Age of apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Age of apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>The entire family were killed by <a href=\"/maximus/29-3447/\">Maximus</a>, who was become Death the most vicious Horseman of <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>, later he used their bodies to create a loyal force of Inhumans beings altered by the Terrigen Mists.

It begins with two mountain climbers reached the walls of their city, Atillan, in the Himalayas when they are turned back with their memories erased. The Inhumans made themselves known to the Fantastic Four when a member of their royalty, Crystal, fled to New York after being ordered to marry Black Bolt's brother. Johnny came across Crystal and attempted to save her from two royal guards from Atillan who were trying to capture her. Beaten, Crystal took him back to the Baxter Building, and revealed herself to the Fantastic Four. She left her dog behind, who had the ability to teleport, which the Fantastic Four used to enter Atillan. Once their presence was discovered, the city was stripped of its advanced technology and destroyed by Black Bolt, and the Inhumans, including Crystal, relocated. They are hinted to have relocated to the moon.</p><p>The Ultimate Attilan is quite different in appearance from the MU version, like a giant wasp's nest crossed with a Gothic cathedral. Ultimate Crystal, Lockjaw and Black Bolt are similar to their counterparts; Medusa is depicted as having actual snakes for hair, like her mythical namesake. Gorgon is female, Karnak projects energy blasts (though he can still sense weaknesses and pressure points), Triton has a more squid-like appearance, and Maximus is a somewhat effete courtier, whom Crystal describes as \"preening\" and a \"peacock\". Other Inhumans shown include Tri-Clops with clairvoyant vision (including the power to see the invisible), Densitor (Maximus' flunky, who can presumably increase his strength, durability and mass, enough to become fireproof) and an unnamed Inhuman who can produce a swarm of insect-like flying creatures from his body.</p><p>They claimed that their city had remained secret for 10,000 years, which makes their ancestors contemporaries with Ultimate Marvel Atlantis. After the freeing of Namor by the Fantastic Four it is discovered that Atlantis and the Inhumans had been at war for thousands of years, and it was the Inhumans that finally sank Atlantis.</p><h3>Earth-9997 - Earth X</h3><p>The Royal Family consisting of Black Bolt, Medusa, Gorgon, Karnak, Luna, and Triton, left the solar system to go and find where they came from. Upon finding the planet they found out that vibranium destroyed it. They also found the Eternals covered in vibranium and couldn't get out. The came back to Earth to find Ahura who is going to be Luna's husband. When they came they wanted to find all Inhumans that was left on Earth. So they found Mr. fantastic and asked him if eh knew a way. He reconfigured Cerebro to find Inhumans and found out that all the people on Earth were Inhumans. Medusa thought about this and told Mr. Fantastic what happened. A while ago Maximus built a machine that would release the Terrigen Mists into Earth's atmosphere mutating the humans on birth. The Royal Family stopped him but at the loss of Lockjaw. Medusa figured it couldn't be Maximus since he was dead when people first started changing. It was Black Bolt, when he and the rest of the Royal Family left he didn't want the Inhumans to be discriminated against so he turned all of Earth into Inhumans. They used the fork on Lockjaw to teleport places.</p><h3>Earth-? - Millennial Visions</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"805648\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28036/805648-inhumansmv1_super.jpg\" title=\"Millennial Visions One\"><img id=\"805648\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28036/805648-inhumansmv1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Millennial Visions One\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Millennial Visions One</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, Magneto confronted the Inhumans and tried to make them part of his empire. After confronting the Royal Family and being denied their support, Magneto is launched into a pitched battle with the Royals, resulting in the loss of his helmet. He attacks the Inhuman children in the mists room, only to have them stolen from him. Releasing the Mists into the castle itself, Magneto escapes, but Karnak orders the Castle to be encompassed in a large bubble, and sunk beneath the ocean waves. The Inhumans within the castle, and the bubble mutate further, with Medusa becoming aquatic, and having to live outside in the ocean itself.</p><p>In this world, the Inhumans were the Ultimate Cosmic weaponry. The Kree had originally designed the Inhumans to evolve into Galactus level threats, eating and destroying the Kree's enemies</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"805649\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28036/805649-inhumansmv2_super.jpg\" title=\"Millennial Visions Two\"><img id=\"805649\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28036/805649-inhumansmv2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Millennial Visions Two\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Millennial Visions Two</div></div></div></div><p>on a planetary level. However, when the Royal family chose to embrace their evolution, their first target was the Kree Homeworld. In a last ditch effort, the Kree called to Galactus for help. Galactus sought out and waged war on the Inhumans, with a final battle between Black Bolt and the Devourer of Worlds. In the final battle, as Black Bolt screamed \"Die.\" it eradicated the two gods and tore a rift in space itself.</p><p>As Space was ripped apart, the remaining Inhumans used their powers to try and contain the destruction of the nearby universe, but it became glaringly obvious they were only delaying the unavoidable. That was until Black bolts voice spoke to Medusa and told her and the other Inhumans to open their minds to him. Using their powers in concert, the Inhumans were able to stem the rift, but in doing so, they have damned themselves to wander and protect the same part of the Universe, never straying too far from the rift to prevent it's power from wreaking havoc, or falling into the wrong hands.</p>",

The team was initially formed when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sandman/29-3544/\">Sandman</a> and Paste Pot Pete (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trapster/29-4328/\">Trapster</a>) were jointly escaping from prison and met the Human Torch, who defeated them. Eventually they recruited a fourth member, the amnesic and inhuman <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/medusa/29-4327/\">Medusa,</a> and attacked the Fantastic Four at Reed and Sue's engagement party. They were defeated twice in a few days and were eventually arrested.</p><p>By the time the Frightful Four decided to make another attempt at destroying the Fantastic Four, Medusa was no longer a viable as she had completely reformed. As a replacement, the Wizard recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thundra/29-7235/\">Thundra</a>. But Thundra proved to have no loyalty for this team as she eventually became attracted to the Thing and opposed the Frightful Four.</p><p>They continue to plague the Fantastic Four, with different assortments of villains every time.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Frightful Four was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Following the defeat of the original team, the Wizard reformed the Frightful Four. Medusa soon deserted them after regaining her memories leaving the Wizard to make several attemps to create a fourth member for the Team. This lead to the recruitment of: <a href=\"/blastaar/29-10963/\">Blastaar</a>, using a mind-controlled <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"/thundra/29-7235/\">Thundra</a>, the <a href=\"/the-brute/29-20090/\">Brute</a> (an alternate Reed Richards from <a href=\"/counter-earth/34-54572/\">Counter-Earth</a>), and then <a href=\"/electro/29-3228/\">Electro</a> when Spider-man had become a member of the Fantastic Four for a brief time and then later, <a href=\"/llyra/29-2178/\">Llyra</a>, who took over the group and forced them to attack the <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Sub-Mariner</a> for her.</p><p>After the Sandman was merged with fellow Spider-man rogue, <a href=\"/hydro-man/29-4457/\">Hydro-man</a>, his mind started to take on a more heroic theme and joined <a href=\"/silver-sable/29-7608/\">Silver Sable's</a> <a href=\"/wild-pack/65-11879/\">Wild Pack</a> and turned his back on the Wizard. The Wizard decided formed an all-new group with the <a href=\"/constrictor/29-2127/\">Constrictor</a>, <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a>, and the <a href=\"/taskmaster/29-4578/\">Taskmaster</a>, but they were bested easily by the Thing and Franklin Richards.

Following this huge defeat, the Wizard disbanded the Frightful Four for a long time, but following the return of the Fantastic Four from Counter-Earth, he reformed the Frightful Four using the Trapster, The <a href=\"/punisher-robot/29-27857/\">Punisher robot</a> and the <a href=\"/sharon-ventura/29-20604/\">She-Thing</a> (failing to recruit the Sandman who the Wizard and used his mind devices to turn back to his criminals way) and attacked <a href=\"/wyatt-wingfoot/29-10275/\">Wyatt Wingfoot's</a> Keewazi reservation.

Wanting to humble the Fantastic Four on equal terms, the Wizard \"trapped\" the Trapster into a time-loop after he threatened Cole, reducing his team's ranks from five to four.

Planting a listening device on Mister Fantastic's FTL (his latest spaceship) and a bomb, the Frightful Four attacked a solo Invisible Woman on <a href=\"/titan/34-41103/\">Saturn's moon of Titan</a> and captured her while the Fantastic Four watched from Earth. As they attempted to rocket to her aid in the FTL, the bomb exploded, but was contained by the Invisible Woman who then attacked the Wizard within an inch of his life and asked for mercy.</p><p>The Wizard rejoined the <a href=\"/intelligencia/65-56959/\">Intellgencia</a> and decided to rebuild his Frightful Four, but this time recruited Klaw and the Trapster (who had freed himself at this point) and the <a href=\"/savage-she-hulk/29-27405/\">Savage She-Hulk</a> to infiltrate the <a href=\"/baxter-building/34-41454/\">Baxter Building</a> and kidnapped Reed Richards.

Later on the team change their name from X-Force to X-Statix.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>A <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel comics</a> team, X-Statix is created by writer <a href=\"/peter-milligan/26-41484/\">Peter Milligan</a> and artist <a href=\"/michael-mike-allred/26-16768/\">Mike Allred</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/x-force/49-4604/\">X-Force</a> #116.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>X-Statix started out as the second <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> team, but changed it's name to X-Statix when core member <a href=\"/u-go-girl/29-12911/\">U-Go Girl</a> died in the line of battle. Her last wish was to rename the team to X-Statix, and so they did. (It also meant a title change in 2002 with a new #1, continuing the story with characters from the previous X-Force). The comic was a humorous take on fame, celebrity and comic standards including \"comic book deaths\" which were rampant in the book. There was also the Princess Diana Controversy. X-Statix #13 was to feature the returned of famed figure, Princess Diana, as a mutant that had returned from the dead. Word got out to the media and <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> dealt with the backlash by altering the character. She became a fictional pop-star Henrietta Hunter along with cosmetic alterations to keep likeness away from Princess Diana.

The Watchers gave nuclear technology to another race of aliens called <a href=\"/prosilicans/65-59170/\">Prosilicans</a> but they used the nuclear technology for war. The Watchers were very disappointed and vowed that they would never interfere with any events and to just observe and record.</p><p>The Watchers often came into conflict with the <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> because of their different way of judgment. The Celestials believed that if the race couldn't keep up with their genetic standards, they would use force to seal the planet and give the good people a chance to reform. The Watchers believed in just observing and recording and not just kill an entire race because they didn't reach the Celestial's standards.</p><p>It has been observed that the Watchers enter a state of consciousness (fugue) in which they appear to be uploading memories to their collective, and at that time are not observing and are unaware of their surroundings. This happens every three years for exactly 42 minutes. It has also been stated that some believe the Watchers to be infinite aspects of a single, powerful entity (although this contradicts the concepts of rogue Watchers and last of the Watchers, which has often been used in other stories).</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Silver Surfer (1998)</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/silver-surfer/17-967/\">Silver Surfer animated series</a>, Uatu is the last of the Watchers.

Disobeying their vows, the Watchers created a miracle cure that saved billions, but in the process it caused them all to become the Virals, organisms with primitive appearances by enhanced minds that connected all of them into a single consciousness.</p><p>Being the last of his kind, Uatu felt responsible for them and returned to them with new knowledge when he could.</p>",

After they had gathered they heard about <a href=\"/terrax/29-2106/\">Terrax</a> rampaging through a local park. They then went to fight him, and found Namorita and Speedball had joined the battle. Beating Terrax together, the five heroes unknowingly were on the way to creating something great. After this, they decided to stay together as a team.

As the incident caught the media's attention, it was realized that someone had decided to re-form the New Warriors. There was, however, a fair amount of debate among the super-hero community (especially those close to Tony Stark) as to who would re-form a team whose only surviving member was branded as a mass murderer (because of their fight with Nitro).

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Newsboy Legion consisted of four orphans who lived on the streets of <a href=\"/suicide-slums/34-56534/\">Suicide Slum</a>, attempting to support themselves by honest means- selling newspapers. However, this business could not always support the group, and they occasionally turned to less licit means, generally stripping cars and selling the parts to Frankie the Fence. Eventually they made an attempt to rob a hardware store for tools to fix up the shack in which they were living, but failed.&nbsp;They had been frequently in trouble with the law because of their extra-legal activities, and this final crime had them brought before a judge who was about to sentence the boys to reform school until they came of age. However, Officer <a href=\"/guardian/29-7644/\">Jim Harper</a>, who had a soft spot for the boys, stepped in, and they were instead placed under his guardianship. The boys suspected that their guardian was in fact the superhero Guardian, however they remained unsure of his secret identity for much of their time together.&nbsp;</p><h2>Creation</h2>The Newsboy Legion was created in 1942 by <a href=\"/joe-simon/26-9443/\">Joe Simon</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>. They were changed for the post-<a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis</a> universe by <a href=\"/roger-stern/26-41502/\">Roger Stern</a>.<br /><h2>Team Evolution</h2>&nbsp;The original Newsboy Legion consisted of <a href=\"/tommy-tompkins/29-69760/\">Tommy Thompkins</a>, the team leader; <a href=\"/anthony-rodriguez/29-69762/\">Big Words</a> (name later revealed to be Anthony Rodriguez), the smart guy of the group and also the tallest of the four boys; <a href=\"/johnny-gabrielli/29-69761/\">Gabby</a> (name later revealed to be Johnny Gabrielli), the most talkative member of the group; and <a href=\"/patrick-macguire/29-69764/\">Scrapper</a> (name later revealed to be Patrick MacGuire), the tough guy who loved to fight. The boys eventually grew up and attended college, where each became a scientist. All of them found work with the DNA Project. They eventually married, and each had a son who was identical to his father. These boys formed their own incarnation of the Newsboy Legion, with the only major difference between the incarnations being the addition of a new member,&nbsp;Walter \"<a href=\"/flip/29-47785/\">Flipper Dipper</a>\" Johnson Jr., an African-American boy who was fond of underwater maneuvers.&nbsp;The team was also briefly joined by \"Famous\" <a href=\"/famous-bobby/29-73134/\">Bobby Harper</a>, the niece of the Guardian, but she was soon sent to stay with other relatives.<br />&nbsp;<br />Post-Crisis the younger Legion was retconned as identical clones that were created by the DNA Project as part of an abortive plot. These Newsboys had the memories of their fathers, but only up to their present age, leaving them occasionally unfamiliar with much of contemporary life and technology. Eventually, both versions of the Legion parted ways with the DNA Project, now known as <a href=\"/project-cadmus/65-47233/\">Project Cadmus</a>, because of changes being made to Cadmus. The younger Newsboys were involved in rescuing <a href=\"/superboy/29-1686/\">Kon-El</a> from Cadmus, and &nbsp;later they rescued <a href=\"/jimmy-olsen/29-3213/\">Jimmy Olsen</a> from the sewers during <a href=\"/countdown-to-final-crisis/39-56194/\">Countdown</a>. They again aided Jimmy, this time in obtaining evidence of the <a href=\"/black-racer/29-10032/\">Black Racer's</a> death using the <a href=\"/whiz-wagon/18-55832/\">Whiz Wagon</a>. The original Legion was killed by <a href=\"/assassin/29-35888/\">Codename: Assassin</a>. The current status of the clones is unknown.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h2>In Other Media</h2>The Newsboy Legion appeared in the <i><a href=\"/justice-league/65-55928/\">Justice League</a> Unlimited</i> episode \"Patriot Act\", wherein they made an unnamed cameo appearance at a parade. There, they expressed discontent that none of the \"good\" heroes were present, and later witnessed the fight between various Leaguers and <a href=\"/general-eiling/29-23237/\">General Wade Eiling</a>. When the rest of the crowd fled the scene, the Newsboys remained behind and attempted to aid the Leaguers, their major effort involving throwing bits of debris at Eiling and commandeering a wrecking ball. They were assigned to crowd control by <a href=\"/vigilante/29-6175/\">Vigilante</a>, who was hoping to keep them out of harm's way. At the end of the episode they were shown playing at being the members of the League that they had earlier disparaged.&nbsp;",

        "description":"<p>The origin of the Celestials has never been fully explained, but there are many theories as to how they came to be. One theory holds they might be survivors of a previous universe. Another states they were created or in some way connected to <a href=\"/eternity/29-11332/\">                       Eternity</a>. Another one states they were created by and serve an entity called the <a href=\"/the-fulcrum/29-60755/\">                       Fulcrum</a> and help it maintain cosmic balance.<br />&nbsp;<br />Whatever their origin may be, one thing is for certain, they are a race of scientists and engineers who have taken upon themselves to \"shepherd\" the development of younger, \"lesser\" races such as <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">                      The Skrulls</a>, though their reasons for doing so is unknown. One theory suggested is they seek to create the next Eternity. Another theory suggests that doing so somehow serves the Fulcrum and, in turn, the balance between Order and Chaos.<br />&nbsp;<br />When the universe was still young, their race was never known to participate in wars, though they sometimes intervened whenever the probability of their experiments being ruined were too high for comfort. But that all changed when they made first contact with <a href=\"/the-watchers/65-11523/\">                       The Watchers</a>, whose views on the controversial subject of older races interfering with the natural development of younger races clashed directly with those of The Celestials. It was their differences of opinion ultimately ignited a war between the two races, unfortunately, the Oath of Non-Interference taken by The Watchers made it forever impossible to stop The Celestials, at least in a direct manner.<br /></p><p>The First Host of Celestials came to Earth about one million years ago to do genetic tests and experiments with the Earth's most intelligent life form, human beings. After many tests and experiments, the Celestials created two sub-species of humans, the <a href=\"../../eternals/65-13344/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Eternals</a> and the <a href=\"../../deviants/65-13345/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Deviants</a>. However, their manipulation of human DNA would give humans the potential to gain superhuman powers and also allow them to give birth to Mutants thanks to the insertion of the X-Gene.</p><p>The Second Host of Celestials came to Earth about 18,000 B.C. to check upon the progress of the First Host's visit. After finding the directions of Deviants counter-productive and in response to Deviants firing on their ship, the Celestials decided to destroy <a href=\"../../lemuria/34-55791/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Lemuria</a>, the Deviants' kingdom. The combination of explosions and eruptions sank Lemuria, <a href=\"../../atlantis/34-41030/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Atlantis</a> and other similar civilizations into the ocean. This disaster became known as the <a href=\"../../the-great-cataclysm/12-55772/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Great Cataclysm</a>. <br />&nbsp;<br />It was during this time that Tiamut the Communicator a.k.a. <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/29-22836/\">             The Dreaming Celestial</a> was framed by a cabal of Celestials lead by <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/29-32857/\">            Arishem the Judge</a>, who was jealous of The Dreaming Celestials' intimate connection to <a href=\"/one-above-all/29-29861/\">           The One Above All</a>. After a long battle with the treacherous traitors, The Dreaming Celestial was sealed away inside the Diablo Mountains for a crime he never committed, just as Arishem had hoped he would.<br /></p><p>The Third Host of Celestials came to Earth around the 10th Century. The Incas, who worshiped the Celestials, built a City of the Space Gods high in the Andes mountains. The Third Host occupied this city as their main base on this visit. The <a href=\"../../council-of-godheads/65-48159/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Council of Godheads</a> of Earth confronted the Third Host with the Eternal <a href=\"../../ajak/29-34946/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Ajak</a> speaking for the Celestials. A pact of non-interference with humanity was agreed upon by the Celestials, Earth's Godheads, the Eternals and the Deviants until the arrival of the Fourth Host. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the late 20th Century, the Fourth Host of Celestials arrived on Earth to judge humanity. Fearing that the Celestials would destroy Earth if they judged against its people, <a href=\"../../zuras/29-13798/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Zuras</a> joined forces with <a href=\"/odin/29-3507/\">                     Odin</a> and led the Eternals into battle against the Celestials, who killed them for attempting to betray them. Odin, who had infused a Celestial-sized version of The Destroyer armor with the souls of nearly every Asgardian in existence along with his own, pushed onward and engaged The Celestials in combat.<br />&nbsp;<br />After wiping out Odin and The Asgardians and defeating an enraged  <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\"> Thor</a>, Arishem the Judge came to a decision and prepared to judge the Earth but not before attempting to end Thor's life. Luckily, <a href=\"/gaea/29-15778/\">                  Gaea's</a> last minute arrival and the offering she made to The Celestials, convinced Arishem to spare Thor and judge Earth worthy of a continued existence. The Celestials then departed for space, taking Gaea's offerings with them. But this would not be the last time anyone would see The Celestials.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Months after the incident with The Fourth Host, Thor ended up being jettisoned into space where he crash-landed on the planet Pangora which Arishem the Judge had found unworthy of a continued existence, Thor made an attempt at driving the Celestial Judge away, but was ignored by Arishem while he summoned forth <a href=\"/exitar-the-exterminator/29-44937/\">              Exitar the Exterminator</a>, a 20,000 foot Celestial who wielded the power to destroy worlds and purify entire galaxies. <br />&nbsp;<br />Thor tried to destroy Exitar from the inside by breaking the dome in his head that allowed Exitar to control his armor from hyperspace, where the true forms of all The Celestials resided, unfortunately Thor was unable to succeed in this endeavor and was spat out of Exitar's \"mouth\" like tobacco. Exitar then proceeded to purify the planet, eradicating only the Space Pirates who had been raping Pangoria and its people for over a thousand years.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />A clone of Thor created by Exitar explained their true intentions to Thor and told him that had he continued to interfere with their plans, Arishem would have altered his judgment and ordered Exitar to destroy the entire planet. The clone also warned Thor that should he interfere in their personal affairs ever again...they would obliterate him. With that, the clone exiled Thor from Pangoria while Arishem and Exitar enveloped the planet in a shield that would keep extraterrestrial intruders out from now on and then moved the planet to a safe and secret location. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Celestials encountered The Fantastic Four, The Fantastic Force, <a href=\"/kristoff-vernard/29-11829/\">                 Kristoff Vernard</a> and <a href=\"/scott-lang/29-20577/\">        Scott Lang</a> a few years later during a crisis that almost saw an end to the millennia long war between the Celestials and the Watchers, who were saved at the last second by The Invisible Woman after she managed to cut Exitar the Exterminator off from the physical plane by using her connection to hyperspace to destroy the link between his true form and his colossal armor.<br /></p><p><a href=\"/nezarr-the-calculator/29-33689/\">                       Nezzar the Calculator</a> and <a href=\"/ashema/29-22835/\">                       Ashema the Listener</a> later returned to Earth to force <a href=\"/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">                       Franklin Richards</a> into choosing which reality, Earth-616 or The Heroes Reborn Universe, would live and which would die. Their intentions were also to take Franklin with them and train him in the proper use of his cosmic power. A power they wished to manipulate for their own personal reasons, however, Ashema's newfound love for Humanity turned her away from this cause and lead her to store the Heroes Reborn Universe inside her own shell, which the other Celestials eventually gathered up and began studying, hinting at the possibility of a second ascension.</p><p>An army of Celestials were later seen on the front lines of <a href=\"/the-fault/34-56597/\">                       The Fault</a> along with <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">                Galactus</a> and <a href=\"/proemial-gods/65-49441/\">               The Proemial Gods</a>, only to either fall or be forced into a tactical retreat by <a href=\"/shuma-gorath/29-14000/\">                       Shuma-Gorath's</a> all-powerful <a href=\"/the-galactus-engine/12-55741/\">                       Galactus Engine</a>. Until recently, they were MIA but thanks to <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">                       Mr. Sinister</a> tampering with the              Dreaming Celestial, The Prime Celestial Host was drawn to Earth and touched down outside of San Francisco where The X-Men attempted to communicate with them.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />However, they were not acknowledged by the Space-Gods, luckily, the newly restored Dreaming Celestial stepped in on their behalf and sent his former brethren away as a way of showing his gratitude to The X-Men for saving his life. No one has seen them since that day.<br /></p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p>The Celestials exist in nearly all realities. <br /></p><h3>\n</h3> <h3>The \"Celestialverse\"  </h3><p>During their search for <a href=\"/beyonder/29-10300/\">          The Beyonder</a> across time and space; <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">         Doctor Doom</a>, <a href=\"/sharon-ventura/29-20604/\">       Sharon Ventura</a>, <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">      The Thing </a>and <a href=\"/human-torch/29-2120/\">     The Human Torch</a> came across a reality completely overrun with Celestials. <br /></p><h3>Earth-82432</h3><p>In a universe where <a href=\"/korvac/29-14467/\">    Korvac</a> conquered the universe, The Celestials were all killed when he absorbed every living thing into himself and tried to become one with Eternity. <br /></p><h3>Earth-89721 </h3><p>Countless generations after the so-called \"<a href=\"/evolutionary-war/39-42181/\">   Evolutionary War</a>\" mutated Humanity into a race of super-intelligent psychics; The Celestials judged them a threat to the totality of Creation and tried to destroy Earth. But when they confronted Humanity, the mutated humans used their combined mental might to erase The Celestials from existence.<br /></p><h3>The Age of Apocalypse<br /></h3><p>Everything was relatively the same up until a lone Celestial Gardner visiting Earth during the reign of Apocalypse was somehow defeated by the tyrant himself, who stole one of the Life Seeds it cultivated while on Earth. It's old suit of armor, which has more than likely abandoned in favor of a new one, now lies in an undisclosed location somewhere on Earth-295, where it is slowly being consumed by the plants and trees of the forest it lays on top of.</p><h3>Marvel Adventures</h3><p>While traveling through time, The Avengers caught a glimpse of Arishem the Judge making his way through a desolate canyon at some unknown point in history. They never learned what he was doing there nor did they have any time to investigate before they were forced to move on to another time period.</p><h3>Earth-4280</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1027308\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43353/1027308-kneel_super.jpg\" title=\"The Celestials of Earth-4280\"><img id=\"1027308\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43353/1027308-kneel_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Celestials of Earth-4280\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Celestials of Earth-4280</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, The Celestials were driven insane by their own power and came to believe that they were the true Gods of their Universe and all others beyond it.</p><p>When they began forcing the lesser races to worship them, the Reed Richards of their Earth attempted to stop them on his own but failed and was captured where they spent hours torturing him while sifting through his memories.</p><p>Through their Reed, they discovered the existence of The Council of Reeds and extracted every bit of information they could about it and the things they kept stored in their Citadel like handfuls of Ultimate Nullifiers and even three Infinity Gauntlets.</p><p>Their dreams of Multiversal conquest would be realized should they manage to take control of The Council's resources.</p><p>A host of Celestials, lead by Arishem the Judge, attacked The Council and attempted to force them into submission, when they realized that the Reeds were not going to yield to them, Arishem and the others began systematically killing off each and every Reed in their sight.</p><p>One Reed, who could access other realities using his own body as a portal, sacrificed himself so that the last Infinity Gauntlet-wielding Reed could unleash its power upon them and create a distraction large enough for his fellow Reeds to escape.</p><p>Earth-616's Reed along with many others began making their escape only to find Eson the Searcher hot on their tail, who promptly ignored most of the other Reeds and focused his attention on Earth-616's, who managed to return to his Universe and slice Eson's hand off by closing the portal behind him just seconds before the immense Celestial managed to snatch him up. Reed of Earth-616 returned shortly afterward with a plethora of weapons capable of harming and temporarily exterminating their Celestial adversaries.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1426478\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1426478-earth_4280_super.jpg\" title=\"The Great Escape\"><img id=\"1426478\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1426478-earth_4280_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Great Escape\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Great Escape</div></div></div></div><p>When their ranks began to diminish, the Celestials retreated and escaped into other universes, with several Reeds hot on their tails. Sometime later, Valeria Richards of Earth-616 discovered the still active portal leading to The Council's citadel and ventured within to find Eson the Searcher and three other unnamed Celestials surrounding the citadel, as if they were waiting for something.</p><p>After managing to slip past them unseen, Valeria found the brain-damaged versions of Doctor Doom the Reeds had been keeping locked away in their basements running amok, though the racket they were causing did not capture the attention of The Celestials.</p><p>It wasn't until the remaining versions of Valeria's father emerged from hiding that The Celestials began to react. With time to spare, some of the Reeds and Valeria managed to flee from them before one of the unnamed Celestials' heat blast could incinerate them.</p><p>The Celestials of Earth-4280 are currently in control of the Citadel and expanding their \"religion\" and influence across the Multiverse. On a list of numerous potential threats to Earth-616 compiled by Reed, their invasion of Earth via \"The Bridge\" was set at Medium status.</p><p>Valeria's later recollection of the events that took place following the escape to Earth-616 indicate that the Celestials of Earth-4280 have the ability to combine into a single entity. Knowing somehow that Earth would unwillingly play host to the mad ones, Galactus had become increasingly concerned about the being within The Galactus Seed, whom he feared would be unleashed should The Celestials annihilate Earth in a fit of mad rage.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2140565\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2140565-it_s_over004.jpg\" title=\"Victory is Nigh\"><img id=\"2140565\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2140565-it_s_over004_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Victory is Nigh\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Victory is Nigh</div></div></div></div><p>To ensure that he could get back to Earth before things get too far out of hand, Galactus gave Reed Richards an \"Arc\" to summon him when the time is right. Later, Doctor Doom, Kristoff Vernard, The FF and the last survivor of the interdimensional Council of Reeds confronted four of the mad ones occupying the Council's old citadel and engaged them in battle with the robot armies of Latveria to aid them.</p><p>The fight eventually came down to Franklin Richards facing off against the mad ones and though for a moment it seemed he might win, the mad ones shrugged off the alterations he made to reality during their fight and infiltrated his mind, filling his mind with strong negative thoughts that shut him down in a matter of seconds.</p><p>Now that they stood triumphant, one of the mad ones proceeded to force the gateway to 616 permanently open by detaching its fingertips and jamming them in the portal.</p><p>Realizing that invasion was now imminent, the group fell back to 616 with the exception of Doom and the last of the Reeds, who stayed behind to hold the mad ones at bay so that the others would have more than enough time to find a way to close the portal and prevent the mad ones from crossing over.</p><p>Franklin, using his abilities, was able to dislodge the fingers of the Celestial keeping the portal open but shortly afterward the fingers combined to form a \"Hand of God\" which quickly took hold of Leech and fused with his body, turning him into a mini-Celestial of sorts programmed with one sole directive: keep the portal open and stop anyone who tries to close it. Meanwhile, the alternate Reed attempted to use The Ultimate Nullifier on the Mad Ones, specifically Eson.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2174431\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2174431-the_end_with_dying_eyes.jpg\" title=\"The End Begins Now\"><img id=\"2174431\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2174431-the_end_with_dying_eyes_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The End Begins Now\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The End Begins Now</div></div></div></div><p>However, Reed was unable to maintain his focus on killing Eson and was destroyed by the imploding Nullifier. Afterward, The Celestials stopped their assault and instead offered Doom a choice: move aside and let them through or die in agony. Doom chose the latter by refusing to move and was promptly incinerated by all four of them.</p><p>With Doom out of the way, the Mad Ones forced their way through the tiny portal, tore apart Doom's Castle and immediately located the being they referred to as the \"Final Anarchist\" (Earth-616's Reed Richards) and then teleported away.</p><p>The Mad Ones reappeared moments later in the midst of a major conflict between the allied forces of The Inhumans, The Annihilation Wave, The Fantastic Four and Galactus who were fighting The Kree at the time and assaulted Galactus directly, who referred to them as \"his true reason\" for being present at the site of the battle.</p><p>The Celestials, having not anticipated Galactus' presence on the battlefield, became rather perturbed and uneasy. They were quick to threaten Galactus with a painful death should he not leave at once. When Galactus revealed that he was fully aware of their most secretive plots, one of the Mad Ones freaked out and together with his brethren dog piled on top of Galactus and began viciously attacking him.</p><p>Galactus managed to kill one of The Celestials, but upon doing so prompted the others to merge with their fallen brother and become a massive \"Super-Celestial\" who, with a single burst of energy, injured Galactus gravely and sent his limp body crashing to Earth. The Combined Mad One then arrived on Earth to finish Reed Richards off. Luckily, he was able to use The Anvil to separate The Mad Ones from one another.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2213199\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2213199-combine003.jpg\" title=\"The Combined Mad One\"><img id=\"2213199\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2213199-combine003_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Combined Mad One\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Combined Mad One</div></div></div></div><p>After a quick moment of silence for their fallen brother, The Mad Ones retaliated with extreme force and wrecked The Anvil. The Human Torch attacked them with a supernova-styled attack that was shrugged off even by the Celestial whose armor had been torn into.</p><p>The Celestials retaliated and overwhelmed Johnny without even trying. With Johnny defeated, The Celestials turned their attention on the others and knocked most of them unconscious, including their target, who they were very eager to get their hands on.</p><p>However, before they could the still very-much awake Invisible Woman tore into the arm of the one who was inches away from crushing Reed and stood before them in defiance.</p><p>The Celestials began attacking her without mercy, pelting her with one blast after another, but amazingly her shield managed to block most of the attacks. Ultimately, however, the constant barrage of energy blasts pushed The Invisible Woman beyond exhaustion making it impossible for her to defend Reed any further.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2213831\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2213831-combine017.jpg\" title=\"A beacon of hope in the midst of despair fills the Heavens.\"><img id=\"2213831\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2213831-combine017_medium.jpg\" alt=\"A beacon of hope in the midst of despair fills the Heavens.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A beacon of hope in the midst of despair fills the Heavens.</div></div></div></div><p>The Celestials gave her one final warning to move aside, but she once again refused by telling them to go to Hell. The Celestials then powered up for one final attack only for it to be interrupted by a brightly shining light coming from above.</p><p>When they looked up, the Mad Ones saw future incarnations of Franklin and Valeria emerging from a rift in time, both ready to strike at the Mad Ones with their own brand of cosmic power.</p><p>Perplexed by the sight of another Franklin, they made a revised observation of the same observation they made of the younger Franklin...only this time they considered him to be a greater threat than his younger self.</p><p>The future Franklin forcefully teleported the Mad Ones into a nearby gas giant to give everyone a bit of respite before the final conflict could begin. The Mad Ones returned moments later and engage Franklin in fierce combat. The Purple-Blue Celestial was the first to fall before Franklin's might, which further enraged the remaining Mad Ones.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2243163\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2243163-float004.jpg\" title=\"The Final Battle Begins.\"><img id=\"2243163\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2243163-float004_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Final Battle Begins.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Final Battle Begins.</div></div></div></div><p>Eson and The Gray-Green Celestial began speeding up their attacks in an attempt to finish Franklin off faster before he could get another chance.</p><p>Unfortunately for The Celestials, Franklin was able to rejuvenate Galactus and supercharge his powers using the power given to him by his younger self thus placing the two Celestials at a serious disadvantage.</p><p>The Gray-Green Celestial died shortly after Galactus' arrival while Eson was destroyed by Franklin's ultimate sacrifice. With Eson's destruction assured, the threat to our existence posed by The Mad Celestials had finally ended, at least on Earth-616, that is.</p><p>During the conflict Nathaniel Richards explained that all of the events that lead up to the final fight with The Mad Celestials had actually happened countless times before in other realities prior to occurring in 616 and that he was always forced to watch Reed die at the hands of The Mad Celestials.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2243159\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2243159-arishem_always.jpg\" title=\"The Cycle Will Begin Anew...Forever.\"><img id=\"2243159\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2243159-arishem_always_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Cycle Will Begin Anew...Forever.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Cycle Will Begin Anew...Forever.</div></div></div></div><p>An outcome which was prevented on 616 thanks to the choices Reed made in life, specifically the ones that lead to Franklin's birth. Despite all of this, however, the outcome in which The Mad Celestials won the final conflict continues to affect the futures of other universes and will continue to do so until the end of time.</p><p>Whether any of the other Mad Celestials will one day venture to 616 to avenge their fallen brethren is uncertain. What is certain, however, is that they will always be out there, spreading their insanity further and further across the Continuum.</p><h3>Unknown Future<br /></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"861636\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/861636-gargal016013scol_super.jpg\" title=\"The Celestial Engine\"><img id=\"861636\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/861636-gargal016013scol_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Celestial Engine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Celestial Engine</div></div></div></div><p>In an alternate future that has been destroyed by the <a href=\"../../the-fault/34-56597/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Fault</a>, the <a href=\"../../badoon/65-22907/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Badoon</a> enslaved the Celestials using the last <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">  Cosmic Cube</a> and created what they called the Celestial Engine.</p><p>The Celestial Engine surrounded The Fault and used the combined power of The Celestials, the Cube and the Sun to create a force field strong enough to hold the Fault from consuming what remained of the universe.</p><p>The Engine was destroyed by the <a href=\"../../guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Guardians of the Galaxy</a> of that time and some members of the Guardians from the 616 reality. After it broke it's alignment, this reality was consumed by the Fault, killing all of The Celestials.<br />&nbsp;<br />But they did not seem to mind this fate, for they were finally free of the Badoon's control, free of the pain and agony they experienced as they spent millennia keeping the ever-expanding Fault from consuming Earth's Solar System. They were at peace now and could rest easy as they moved on to their next lives.<br /></p><h3>Earth-9997 (Earth X)</h3><p>How The Celestials began as a human-like race from the same universe as Galactus, their hunger for greater knowledge was so immense that they developed at a rather quick pace, so quick that they reached the apex of technology and understanding of the Universe faster than they expected. With the threat of stagnation on the horizon, The Celestials became desperate to find something else they could study and learn from.</p><p>Their own bodies proved to be their salvation, because they had focused all attention on learning about everything else, The Celestials knew very little about the inner workings of their own unique biology. Thus began a long series of experiments that resulting in their ascension into immortal beings made of pure anti-matter energy. Unfortunately, their actions had resulted in the loss of their ability to reproduce and ability to maintain cohesion on a physical plane of existence.</p><p>To fix the latter problem, they built massive armored suits which they could control remotely from hyperspace in order to interact with the physical world, however the threat of stagnation was still approaching and then, the rotted pillars holding their birth-reality together collapsed. Apparently, their experiments had destabilized the very fabric of time/space, causing it to implode.</p><p>However, their actions also lead to <a href=\"../../captain-universe/29-27193/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       The Enigma Force</a> transforming Galan of Taa into <a href=\"../../galactus/29-2149/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Galactus</a>, a young woman into the physical embodiment of the new <a href=\"../../death/29-12620/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Death Abstract</a> and the rise of <a href=\"../../phoenix-force/29-2164/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       The Phoenix</a>. Not only that but it had saved them from stagnation, with all of the new realities created in the wake of the original universe's death, they could literally do anything they wanted and feed their hunger for knowledge in the process.</p><p>In this reality, the first encounter between the Celestials and the Watchers resulted in the enslavement of the latter species due to their failure to stop the birth of the original Galactus. As punishment, The Celestials forced them to watch over the embryos they laid inside the hearts of planets. When a Fifth Host arrived to destroy Earth and bring about the birth of a new Celestial, they were driven back by Galactus (Franklin Richards), who then removed the embryo from the heart of the world and consumed it.</p><p>When The Celestials and Elders of The Universe were shut off from the worlds they were once able to freely manipulate, they focused all their rage on Franklin, who was saved by the new Eternity, a combination of his own Father and the fully restored Cosmic Consciousness of <a href=\"/captain-universe/29-27193/\">                       Captain Universe</a>.</p><h3>Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2105303\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2105303-ultimate_celestials.jpg\" title=\"Xorn and The Celestials of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)\"><img id=\"2105303\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2105303-ultimate_celestials_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Xorn and The Celestials of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Xorn and The Celestials of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</div></div></div></div><p>In the Ultimate Universe, The Celestials are not nigh-omnipotent armored space gods but rather a group of forcibly-evolved humans that willfully serve under the benevolent rule of Kuyan-Yin a.k.a. <a href=\"/xorn/29-3183/\">                       Xorn</a> in the \"Celestial City\" portion of Tian.

The Celestials have shown the ability to move planets at will, lay waste to entire worlds that they deem unfit for survival, destroy artifacts that are thought to be indestructible, such as the Asgardian <a href=\"/destroyer/29-7940/\">                       Destroyer</a> Armour, and even contain and destroy entire universes.</p><p>When the Skyfathers of Earth's dimension: <a href=\"/odin/29-3507/\">                       Odin</a>, <a href=\"/zeus/29-10226/\">                       Zeus</a>, and <a href=\"/vishnu/29-15392/\">                       Vishnu</a> combined their energies into a single attack powerful enough to reduce an entire galaxy to nothingness and attacked the Celestial leader known as <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/29-32857/\">                       Arishem the Judge</a>, the combined might of the Skyfathers failed to even faze Arishem in the slightest. Arishem the Judge responded by threatening to permanently seal off the dimensional links to <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/34-40990/\">                       Asgard</a>, <a href=\"/olympus/34-55673/\">                       Olympus</a>, and Nirvana along with the rest of the realms belonging to other Godheads, which frightened the Skyfathers to the point that they went down on their knees and acknowledged their inferiority to the all-powerful Celestial leader.</p><p>Despite their great power, it is still possible to \"injure\" a Celestial. One such instance was when a 2,000 feet tall Odin while wearing the Asgardian Destroyer Armour infused with the souls of all the Asgardians (except for <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">                       Thor</a>), wielding the <a href=\"/odinsword/18-55890/\">                       Odinsword</a> managed to cut off Nezzar's arm, although the Celestial regenerated instantly. <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/29-22836/\">                       Tiamut</a> the Dreaming Celestial has gone as far as stating that it is impossible to truly kill a Celestial. However, a Celestial can be imprisoned by its fellow Celestials.</p><p><a href=\"/nathaniel-richards/29-7221/\">                       Nathaniel Richards</a> suspected that the source of the Celestial's powers were from Hyperspace. This theory would prove how <a href=\"../../invisible-woman/29-2190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Invisible Woman</a> was able to crack a hole in <a href=\"../../exitar/29-44937/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                       Exitar</a> the Exterminator's armor and cut off his link to the physical realm, destroying his immense armor in the process. The Celestials are also capable of communicating with their counterparts from every reality and timeline in existence no matter what points in time they are inhabiting while communicating. This includes Past to Present, Past to Future, Present to Future and vice versa.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Eternals first came into being about a million years ago when the First Host of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> arrived on <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a> to perform genetic experiments on the nascent human race. To test the adaptability of the human gene, the Celestials accelerated the evolution of a handful of subjects and gave them the genetic potential to mentally manipulate limited quantities of cosmic energy, as well as other superhuman traits. Thus the Celestials created the race of Eternals, an evolutionary offshoot of humanity. The Celestials also performed similar experiments on subjects that led to the creation of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deviants/65-13345/\">Deviants</a>, another offshoot of humanity.</p><p>The Celestials altered the structure of the DNA complexes of the first generation of Deviants. The result was an unstable genetic code that radically changed the physical characteristics of Deviants with each generation. Thus a Deviant child will greatly differ in appearance from either of his or her parents. The Celestials experiments also involved implantation of latent genetic material in specimens of humanity's ancestors that would one day permit benevolent mutations in human beings.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p><a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, the King of Comics, created the Eternals. Kirby was the writer and illustrator for their first appearance in the Eternals vol 1 #1 (7/1976). <a href=\"/john-verpoorten/29-11436/\">John Verpoorten</a> was the inker for this issue.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Eternals are long lived, possibly unaging, but not immortal. They can be killed if their molecules are dispersed over a large enough area. There are few Eternals due to their low birth rate. If they do mate with humans the baby will always be human. Eternals have sworn to protect humans from their cousins the Deviants. Eternals also have higher technology than the human race. Eternals faced a civil war over if they should conquer other races. One side was lead by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kronos/29-28005/\">Kronos</a> who said they shouldn't while the other was lead by Uranos who said they should.</p><p>Kronos side won and Uranos left Earth and traveled to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/uranus/34-56295/\">Uranus</a> where he and the rest built a civilization. Uranos and his group built a spaceship and attempted to return to Earth to start another war but they were attacked by a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a> ship. The survivors among Uranos' group were forced to land on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titan/34-41103/\">Titan</a>, Saturn's moon, giving rise to an Eternal civilization there. The Kree captured one of the Eternals and did experiments on him. This led the Kree to go to Earth and experiment on humans which led to another offshoot of humanity, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a>. Still powerful but not on the Eternals level.</p><p>Kronos started experimenting in cosmic energy until it went wrong and a destructive energy surge went through the Eternals' city, Titanos. The surge destroyed Titanos and bombarded the Eternals in irradiated energy which activated latent genes that gave them their long lifespans, virtual invulnerability and they found that they could manipulate cosmic energy. This gave them god-like abilities. The accident left Kronos' atoms scattered in an immaterial state but his astral form still survives on this plane of reality, quietly observing life in the universe.</p><p>After the accident, Kronos' sons, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zuras/29-13798/\">Zuras</a> and A'Lars, initiated the first union of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/uni-mind/29-14527/\">Uni-Mind</a>, a collective melding of the minds and bodies of the Eternals, to decide upon Kronos' successor as leader. Zuras was chosen as leader and to avoid further conflicts A'Lars left Earth and journeyed into outer space. A'Lars eventually discovered the war-torn remains of the Eternal civilization on Titan along with one survivor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sui-san/29-60709/\">Sui-San</a>. The two fell in love and in time repopulated Titan together as well as producing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfox/29-7257/\">Starfox</a> among their children.</p><p>A'Lars would be known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mentor/29-14522/\">Mentor</a>. Since Sui-San's latent gene was not activated by the cosmic energy of Kronos' lab accident, the Eternals of Titan are not as powerful or as long-lived as the Eternals of Earth. During the rule of Zuras on Earth, he directed the construction of the city of Olympia in a mountainous region in Greece. Two other Eternal cities were founded as well. Polaria in Siberia and Oceana in the Pacific. Olympia lay near the principal nexus between Earth's dimension and that of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/olympian-gods/65-44825/\">Olympian Gods</a> on Mount <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/olympus/34-55673/\">Olympus</a>.</p><p>Zuras and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zeus/29-10226/\">Zeus</a>, leader of the Olympian gods, made a mutual non-interference pact between their two races. The people of ancient Greece and Rome often confused the Olympian Eternals with the Olympian Gods. Over the centuries, many Eternals went on to live lives among ordinary human beings. The Eternals have also continually fought the Deviants' attempts to gain power or to subjugate humanity.</p><p>Around the 10th Century, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/council-of-godheads/65-48159/\">Council of Godheads</a> of Earth met with the Third Host of Celestials with the Eternal <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ajak/29-34946/\">Ajak</a> speaking for the Celestials. A pact of non-interference with humanity was agreed upon by the Celestials, Earth's Godheads, the Eternals and the Deviants until the arrival of the Fourth Host. The Eternals and the Deviants formed a truce until the Celestials' return.</p><p>In the late 20th Century, the Fourth Host of Celestials arrived on Earth to pass judgment and the Deviants renewed hostilities against the Eternals. The Deviants attempted to sabotage the arrival of the Fourth Host which was prevented by the Eternals. Two Deviants, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karkas/29-13936/\">Karkas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ransak-the-reject/29-14006/\">Ransak the Reject</a>, became allies of the Eternals and left Lemuria to become residents of Olympia.</p><p>Fearing that the Celestials would destroy Earth if they judged against its people, Zuras led the Eternals against the Celestials, who retaliated by killing him. The Celestials nevertheless judged in Earth's favor and left Earth. Zuras's daughter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thena/29-13822/\">Thena</a>, assumed the position of leader and Zuras is put to rest in Olympia.</p><p>Later, the Eternals are taken prisoners when the Deviants invade Olympia. The Eternals are able to escape and defeat their captors with the timely aid of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/war-machine/29-1926/\">James Rhodes</a> as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>.</p><p>During this conflict, Thena was in mental contact with Zuras' spirit before it left this plane of reality, and thus learned that the Eternals were to leave Earth to explore space now that the Celestials had departed. The Eternals argued on this subject for a time and resolved that this matter can only be settled by joining in the Uni-Mind. Months later in New York, some <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> attended a party hosted by an Eternal called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sersi/29-2118/\">Sersi</a>.</p><p>When other Eternals crashed the party to take Sersi to join the Uni-Mind, the Avengers assumed she was being kidnapped and called in the rest of the team to follow them to the Eternals' city of Olympia. The Eternals explained to the Avengers that Sersi was in no danger as well as the relevance of the Uni-Mind. They soon learned that one of the Avengers among them, Starfox, was also an Eternal and invites him to join the melding of the Uni-Mind.</p><p>Despite interference from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maelstrom/29-2493/\">Maelstrom</a> wishing to siphon power from the Uni-Mind for himself, the Eternals survive this conflict with the aid of the Avengers. The Eternals did reach a decision as the Uni-Mind and they all agreed that the Eternals should leave Earth. Virtually all of Earth's Eternals left for space in the form of the Uni-Mind. However, the Eternals' collective consciousness in the Uni-Mind decreed that a small number of Eternals who were particularly involved in Earthly matters remain behind.</p><p>Among the Eternals who remained on Earth were Thena, their ruler, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ikaris/29-13967/\">Ikaris</a>, Sersi, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/makkari/29-13945/\">Makkari</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gilgamesh/29-29157/\">Gilgamesh</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pixie/29-21205/\">Pixie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sprite/29-20588/\">Sprite</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cybele/29-26127/\">Cybele</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phastos/29-20591/\">Phastos</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/khoryphos/29-20590/\">Khoryphos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/interloper/29-14605/\">Interloper</a>. They also discovered the existence of Eternals on Titan and what happened to A'Lars (Mentor) as a result of Starfox being part of the Uni-Mind. The Eternals have helped Earth's heroes, particularly the Avengers, against several menaces. Sersi and Gilgamesh are also members of the Avengers but not on active status.</p><p>In the Neil Gaiman run, the Eternals had their memories erased. Sprite, an Eternal who will forever remain a child, was tired of people treating him like a child. So he erased the Eternals' memories and changed their perception of history. Mike Curry, a Doctor, dreamt of being Makkari and meeting Ikaris, one of the few Eternals who remembered more than the others, found more and more memories surfacing Mark/Makkari dismissed them as symptoms of overwork whilst believing he was losing his mind. Sersi was now a fashionable party planner. Thena was a weapons designer working for Stark Industries and was happily married with a young child. Druig was a politician in Vorozheika. Sprite had become a teeny sensation with tv shows, movies and other assorted merchandise. Zuras was a homeless drunk. Ikaris was kidnapped by a group of Deviants and tortured, seemingly in an attempt to kill him at the behest of a mysterious employer. When a party for various celebrities and dignitaries held to increase awareness of Vorozheika was attacked by armed gunman, several of the Eternals present briefly used their powers, albeit instinctively. This attack was made by rivals of Druig who sought to eliminate him. Makkari was the primary saviour of this incident, his superspeed kicking in and allowing him to remove the hail of bullets and disarming the attackers. Thena was taken by the armed gunman but escaped later on after remembering she was a warrior. She contacted Iron Man who quickly found her location. In the aftermath of the botched attack, Druig found his powers, if not his memories, awoken and set about establishing himself as the new ruler of Vorozheika by particularly brutal and sadistic means. The mysterious employer of the Deviants was revealed to be the Eternal Ajax who was entrusted with the task of monitoring events by Zuras prior to Sprite's reality warping.</p><p>Ikaris remembered (after being atomised and regenerating in the Eternal bastion at the North Pole) and gathered the newly awoken Eternals (Sersi, Makkari and others) in a bid to stop a Deviant plot to awaken a sleeping Celestial (Ikkaris was the only fully returned Eternal, the others had merely had their memories returned). It transpired that the sleeping Celestial was the same one who created the Deviants all those millennia ago and as a result was punished by the other Celestials. This Celestial's awakening was an event dire enough to worry the Watcher and even remind Galactus what it is like to know fear.</p><p>The Eternals gathered and formed a Uni-Mind in the hope they could either talk to or fight the Dreaming Celestial. Instead, it merely shut them off. This Celestial spoke to Makkari (who was created <em>specially</em> by this Celestial and as well as his super-speed has other interesting features hard-wired into his DNA) and told him that it will judge the Earth, but was unclear how long it would take. It also alluded to a mysterious threat called the Horde (the Locusts of the Universe?) which will come to Earth and consume all life. Following this the Celestial reverted to being dormant, becoming something of a tourist attraction in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a>. The Eternals and the Avengers reached something of a peaceful resolution. Sprite, still completely human and completely unrepentant, tried to escape on a train but was found by Zuras who broke his neck and left the body.</p><p>Shortly after this an army of Deviants marched upon the Eternals' fortress. Their leader challenged Makkari to a duel. Makkari accepted, easily dodging the Deviant general's attacks. When it came to his own, instead Makkari spared the Deviant's life, fulfilling a Deviant prophecy regarding a being called the Skadrach. After this, Zuras, the Chief Eternal, orders Ikaris and Makkari to go out and search for the remaining Eternals. Unfortunately, the various loose ends have yet to be tied up as this series has yet to be followed.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Eternals\u2019 bodily cells contain cosmic energy, and they maintain constant mental control over every molecule of their bodies. Eternals are virtually immortal, and can be restored to life even if the molecules of their bodies are scattered. All Eternals possess the capacity for superhuman strength, telepathy, flight, teleportation, illusion-casting, transmutation of organic and inorganic matter, and the generation of various forms of energy from their bodies, including force, heat, light, and other electromagnetic radiation. Some Eternals have devoted themselves to specializing in a particular facet of their powers, and can increase their proficiency in one area by decreasing their power in another. The Eternal who serves as Prime Eternal can generate blue flame which will merge anyone who passes through it into a Uni-Mind, a powerful psychic entity which embodies the collective power of every individual who created it. A Uni-Mind requires the participation of at least seven Eternals in order to succeed.</p><p>The Eternals have complete control over their molecules. This can grant them shapeshifting abilities, healing abilities and many others. They can draw oxygen from water. They can also breath in different environments. They do not show signs of fatigue from physical activity such as running for an unlimited time without getting tired. Extended use of powers can cause fatigue. The Eternals have been shown to come back from getting their molecules dispersed. As long as a Celestial machine is running they cannot die. Their cosmic powers grant them a number of other abilities such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Accelerated Healing</strong></li><li>Due to the experiments that Deviants have done on Eternals they can survive or regenerate from most anything. The Deviants have tried to fry and liquefy the Eternals organs, putting an Eternal in a smelter, a car crusher and an acid bath only for the Eternal to heal from it. They detonated a bomb in front of one and then the Eternal fell off a very high building only to heal in two days. They have tried to blow the Eternal apart from molecule to molecule and atom to atom only for the Eternal to recover.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Reincarnation</strong><br />If the Eternals die they will awake in the reactivation chamber which is underground in Antarctica, in a few days.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Super Strength</strong></li><li>The strength of an Eternal varies. An Eternal can focus their cosmic energy to increase their strength. Physically the strongest Eternal is <a href=\"/gilgamesh/29-29157/\">The Forgotten One</a>, Gilgamesh, who is capable of hurting Thor.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Project blasts</strong></li><li>Blast of cosmic energy through their eyes or hands.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Flight</strong></li><li>Ranging from minuscule levitation to supersonic travel. The Eternal, <a href=\"/ikaris/29-13967/\">Ikaris</a>, is capable of flying at 850 miles per hour.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Telepathy</strong><br />Varying degrees of telepathic abilities.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Teleportation</strong></li><li>They can teleport over great distances. <a href=\"/sersi/29-2118/\">Sersi</a> has been shown to teleport across the United States. However, they find this method of travel unpleasant.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Transmutation</strong></li><li>Change the objects size, shape and molecules.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Force-Field</strong>The Eternals have a very thin force field that is so close that it is practically in their skin. This force field reduces the strength from physical attacks, heat and pressure.</li></ul><h2>Specialization</h2><p>Some Eternals have taken all their cosmic power and transferred it into one thing, focusing their abilities.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sersi/29-2118/\">Sersi</a>: Boosted her power of transmutation.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gilgamesh/29-29157/\">Gilgamesh</a>: Boosted his strength and durability</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ikaris/29-13967/\">Ikaris</a>: Uses it to enhance his senses.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/makkari/29-13945/\">Makkari</a>: Uses his for superspeed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/interloper/29-14605/\">Interloper</a>: Uses his to show the fear of others.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2>Around a million years ago, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/celestials/65-13343/\"> Celestials</a> of the First Host arrived on Earth to perform experiments on humankind. The Celestials altered the genetic code in a group of prehistoric humans that resulted in the first generation of Deviants. The result was an unstable genetic code that radically changed the physical characteristics of Deviants with each generation. Thus a Deviant child will greatly differ in appearance from either of his or her parents.<br /><br />The Celestials' also performed different experiments on other prehistoric humans that resulted in the first generation of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eternals/65-13344/\"> Eternals</a>. The Celestials' other experiments produced the potential for mutation in humankind. The unstable genetic code of Deviants gives them power and abilities superior to humans but inferior to the Eternals' god-like powers. The non-human appearance of Deviants is also the result of their unstable genetic code.<br /><br /><h2>Creation</h2><a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, the King of Comics, created the Deviants. Kirby wrote and illustrated their first appearance in the Eternals vol 1 #1 (7/1976). <a href=\"/john-verpoorten/29-11436/\">John Verpoorten</a> was the inker for this issue.<br /><br /><h2>Team Evolution</h2>At first, the Deviants kept themselves hidden underground founding the vast empire of Subterranea but the Deviants and the Eternals would have conflicts with each other. The Deviants developed a civilization and a technology more advanced than humanity. Around 18,500 B.C., the Deviants came to be the dominant race and enslaved humans while certain Eternals such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ikaris/29-13967/\"> Ikaris</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gilgamesh/29-29157/\"> Gilgamesh</a> opposed the Deviants. The conflicts continued as the Deviants relied on science and technology for advantages&nbsp;against the Eternals' superior powers and strength.&nbsp;The Deviants also lacked immortality and experimented to increase their life-spans.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Deviants founded a city known as the City of Toads in the country of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lemuria/34-55791/\"> Lemuria</a>&nbsp;on the Mu continent. By 18,000 B.C., the Deviants established a powerful empire and the only&nbsp;significant human&nbsp;opposition came from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atlantis/34-41030/\"> Atlantis</a>. During the arrival of the Second Host of Celestials, the Mu continent suffered a devastating catastrophe that sank the landmass along with Lemuria and Atlantis. The Deviant Emperor Phraug had ordered the conquest of Atlantis.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Atra, a human priest in Lemuria who worshiped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/set/29-29092/\"> Set</a>, opposed the Deviants and&nbsp;had plans to conquer Lemuria&nbsp;with his allies, the Serpent Men, the children of Set.&nbsp;Atra crafted the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/serpent-crown/18-15780/\"> Serpent Crown</a>&nbsp;as a conduit for Set's power to achieve this goal. Phraug, a worshiper of Set as well, also coveted the Serpent Crown&nbsp;from&nbsp;Atra.<br />&nbsp;<br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-kamuu/29-36921/\"> Kamuu</a>, ruler of Atlantis, used magma pits near the city,&nbsp;normally used for heating Atlantis, to destroy invading fleets from Lemuria.&nbsp;The release of the pits' destructive power caused volcanic eruptions across the region that sank Atlantis.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Atra had begun his attack on Lemuria as the first being to wear the Serpent Crown but Set did not allow his power to be used on his Deviant worshipers.&nbsp;The Deviants in Lemuria also spotted the Celestials' ship and fired upon them. The Celestials responded by firing upon Lemuria with&nbsp;destructive force that sank Lemuria as well.&nbsp;Phraug and Atra both died in the destruction of Lemuria and the Serpent Crown was lost for centuries.<br />&nbsp;<br />The combination of explosions&nbsp;and eruptions&nbsp;caused the whole continent of Mu to sink into the ocean. The&nbsp;Deviant survivors of what&nbsp;came to be&nbsp;known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-great-cataclysm/12-55772/\"> Great Cataclysm</a>&nbsp;moved underground. The southern half of Lemuria had sank underground&nbsp;and the sea had been shut out from this area. Lemuria and the&nbsp;capital, the City of Toads, was re-established&nbsp;as&nbsp;the Deviants'&nbsp;subterranean kingdom.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />A Deviant survivor known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kro/29-11939/\"> Warlord Kro</a> appeared to&nbsp;have the unique trait&nbsp;of immortality produced by the Deviants' unstable DNA.&nbsp;Kro kept this knowledge a secret from his Deviant brethren. Kro feared his own dissection as research into immortality and pretended to be his own descendants.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Deviants replaced the loss of their human slaves by creating cloned slaves but these clones&nbsp;either rebelled against or proved unable to serve the Deviants. These clones branched off into different subterranean factions and later became known as the Gortokians (the first&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/subterraneans/65-56642/\"> Subterraneans</a>), the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lava-men/65-55859/\"> Lava Men</a>&nbsp;(mutated branch of Gortokians), the Moloids (servants of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mole-man/29-2481/\"> Mole Man</a>) and the Tyrannoids (servants of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tyrannus/29-3468/\"> Tyrannus</a>).&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Deviants developed an entire religion focused on worshiping a rogue Celestial known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dreaming-celestial/29-22836/\"> Dreaming Celestial</a>&nbsp;who was punished for an unknown crime. The Celestials have erased the Dreaming Celestial's true name from their records and keep his body inert in an underground vault.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Deviants somehow believed that the Dreaming Celestial was punished for their creation. The Deviant priesthood also believed in visions of the Deviants' revenge on the Celestials. The Deviant priests prepared for this event by gathering their most monstrous Deviants as an army and placed them in suspended animation.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Deviants and the Eternals continued to have conflicts with each other until the arrival of the Third Host of Celestials around the 10th Century. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/council-of-godheads/65-48159/\"> Council of Godheads</a> of Earth met with the Third Host of Celestials with the Eternal <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ajak/29-34946/\"> Ajak</a> speaking for the Celestials.&nbsp;A pact of non-interference with humanity was agreed upon by the Celestials, Earth's Godheads, the Eternals and the Deviants until the arrival of the Fourth Host. The Eternals and the Deviants formed a truce until the Celestials' return.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />In the late 20th Century, the Fourth Host of Celestials arrived on Earth and the Deviants renewed hostilities against the Eternals. The Deviants attempted to sabotage the arrival of the Fourth Host which was prevented by the Eternals. Two Deviants, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karkas/29-13936/\"> Karkas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ransak-the-reject/29-14006/\"> Ransak the Reject</a>, became allies of the Eternals and left Lemuria to become residents of Olympia.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brother-tode/29-14005/\"> &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Brother Tode</a>, the Deviants' ruler at the time, ordered construction of New Lemuria beneath New York and restoration of&nbsp;Lemuria after being damaged by the Celestial, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eson-the-searcher/29-46841/\"> Eson</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\"> Thor</a>&nbsp;stopped the construction and New Lemuria was destroyed as a result. The Fourth Host finally passed judgment and judged in favor of Earth. The Celestials left Earth while Brother Tode ordered the&nbsp;invasion of&nbsp;the Eternals' city of Olympia and imprisoned all the Eternals using brain-mines.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Eternals are able to escape and defeat their captors with the timely aid of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/war-machine/29-1926/\"> James Rhodes</a>&nbsp;as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\"> Iron Man</a>. Kro managed to escape while the rest of the defeated Deviants, which included Brother Tode and most of the ruling class,&nbsp;were transformed and fused&nbsp;into a giant block of stone by the Eternals. The stone cube remained in Olympia for several months.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />When&nbsp;the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/uni-mind/29-14527/\"> Uni-Mind</a>&nbsp;left Earth&nbsp;on a journey through the universe, the Uni-Mind&nbsp;brought the giant cube with it. Later, the restoration of Lemuria was finished by the remaining Deviants. Ranar, Brother Tode's son, demanded his right to succeed his father as ruler. A high ranking lord in the Deviant priesthood, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ghaur/29-14491/\"> Ghaur</a>, refused Ranar and killed him.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Warlord Kro was put into place as the Deviant ruler of Lemuria while Ghaur and the priesthood were the real power in the empire and used Kro as a puppet leader. Ghaur had plans for world domination and to gain&nbsp;significant power which was usually opposed by Earth's heroes, the Eternals and rogue Deviants such as Kro, Karkas&nbsp;and Ransak the Reject.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Deviant&nbsp;empire in Lemuria went through different terms of rulers&nbsp;when Ghaur was eventually defeated and apparently slain in battle.&nbsp;Later, Kro stepped down as ruler leaving another Deviant, Visara, to take his place. Visara was later killed in a rebellion against his rule.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Ghaur&nbsp;was&nbsp;resurrected&nbsp;and returned&nbsp;to&nbsp;assume&nbsp;control&nbsp;of&nbsp;Lemuria.&nbsp;Some time&nbsp;later,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\"> Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;launched an attack on Lemuria that caused mutations in the Deviant populace. Afterwards, Kro and Ghaur formed an uneasy alliance where both were forced to share power as rulers of Lemuria.",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Hellfire Club is a centuries old organization with roots in Britain during the 18th Century. It's members were infamous rakes who used their connections within the club to further boost their social standing and to indulge their sexual excesses.</p><p>Over time the club has evolved to include high-flying business men and women, as well as the profitable descendants of royalty and other Hellfire Club members. Being a member of the Hellfire Club is an illustrious boost among elite society. However, there is an even more esoteric sect of individuals who run the Hellfire Club, known as the Inner Circle.</p><h3>The Inner Circle</h3><p>The Club is run by a small group of influential members who form the infamous Inner Circle. Named after chess pieces, members of the Inner Circle will take on the titles of the Black and White (and later also Red) Kings, Queens, Bishops, and Rooks. The final position of Lord Imperial is reserved for the most powerful member of the club. Additionally, prominent members have also had assistants that did not have official titles within the club.</p><p>The Inner Circle was not always mutant dominated, but few members in several generations were not mutants. The Inner Circle dominates the club and secretly influences the club's activities in order to achieve even more power and wealth.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Hellfire club was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"/john-byrne/26-1770/\">John Byrne</a> and it made it's first appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-god-spare-the-child/37-20114/\">Uncanny X-Man #129</a>.</p><p>The name of the Hellfire Club can be traced back to socialite clubs in the real world that dates back as far as 18th century of Britain and Ireland. Men of high social standing would gather to take part in \"immoral acts\" that would remain a secret. This mainly pertained to intercourse with young women who were hired. The first was founded in London in 1719. Over the decades, new clubs would spring up using the Hellfire Club name. The club motto at one was \"Fais ce que tu voudras\", which translates to \"Do what thou wilt\". One of the many historically significant figures include Benjamin Franklin during 1758. In 1781, a man by the name of Joseph Alderson created a club based off the Hellfire Club's original ideals while at Brasenose College in Oxford , but his version was called the Phoenix Society (later named the Phoenix Common Room).</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>The Hellfire Club was originally founded in 18th century England by, Sir Francis Dashwood, Duncan Munro and Scotman John Stuart (Third Earl of Butte). It had some connection to King James I and retained some of his writings on the occult from the 16th and 17th centuries. In the 1760s, it functioned as a social club for the elite of British society. The Club not only provided its members with pleasures, often of sorts that violated moral standards at the time, but also sewed as a means for the members to consolidate their Influence over British economic and political matters. During the Revolutionary War, Philadelphia members tried to obtain secret information from Major General Wallace Worthington. In 1859 the club had to align itself with Apocalypse.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"830778\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35895/830778-hellfire_queens_super.jpg\" title=\"Hellfire Queens\"><img id=\"830778\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35895/830778-hellfire_queens_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hellfire Queens\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hellfire Queens</div></div></div></div><p>A number of the Club's most important members emigrated to the colony of New York in the 1780s, where they founded the new American Hellfire Club. Clemens and Knight served as its first leaders under their Club titles of Black King and Black Queen. The Club's headquarters was an abandoned church that stood on the site of the present day Hellfire Club mansion, located at what is now Fifth Avenue on Manhattan's East Side, only a few blocks away from the Avengers Mansion.</p><p>Today's Hellfire Club counts among its members the wealthy, the powerful, and the celebrated from virtually all over the world. Membership is by Invitation only, but such Invitations are rarely turned down, for membership in the Hellfire Club Is universally regarded as the ultimate status symbol. Membership is also hereditary. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">Norman Osborne</a> have both been invited into the Hellfire Club.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Council of the Chosen</h3><ul><li><b>White King:</b> Edward \"Ned\" Buckman</li></ul><ul><li><b>White Queen:</b> Paris Seville</li></ul><ul><li><b>Black Bishop: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\">Sebastian Shaw</a></b></li></ul><p>Edward Buckman invited many people into the Hellfire Club including Howard Stark, Warren Worthington Jr., and Sir James Braddock.

The Phoenix used her mental powers and left Wyngarde in a catatonic state but the damage to phoenix was already done. Wyngarde's mental tampering transformed her into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Dark Phoenix</a>.

X-Force was brainwashed into hunting down <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a>, but instead Cable used his own powers to free his team.

Shaw would soon find out that his aide Tessa had been a spy for Professor Xavier all along.

However, it no longer revolves around the chessboard-based Inner Circle in high society. Instead, the Hellfire Club is a group of spoiled boys who attend Xavier's Academy for the Gifted. The members included Angel, Forge, Havok, Longshot Pyro, Quicksilver and Kitty Pryde. All of them, bar Kitty, had advanced beyond Epsilon-Delta level to Beta level, and often taunted others who they saw as below them.</p><p>They use the Danger Room for their own needs, including turning it into a nightclub complete with simulated girls for them to flirt with. They would often skip classes and break curfew to meet outside and roast marshmallows over a bonfire. Their rule breaking was often over-looked as they were favorites of Magneto. As a new student, Kitty wanted to study, but the other members of the club would steal her books to force her to play with them. If she ran away, they would spend hours chasing her around the mansion until she phased into the crawl space between walls to hide from them.</p><h3>Wolverine &amp; the X-Men</h3><p>This animated version of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle closely resembles the first roster encountered by the X-Men on Earth-616. However, Emma Frost had been sent to infiltrate the X-Men to gain closer access to any knowledge they had about Jean Grey's whereabouts.</p><p>It transpired that they were hunting down the entity known as the Phoenix, who had inhabited telepaths on Earth throughout history. They had kept many archaic pieces of art which told the story of the Phoenix. They had organized a telepathic assault on Jean Grey, which caused the explosion which tore the X-Men apart at the start of the series. Emma Frost used her telepathic powers with the powers of the five Stepford Cuckoos to attack Jean Grey's mind and force the Phoenix out of her body, which caused the explosion.</p><p>When the X-Men had located &amp; retrieve Jean Grey, Emma Frost used her powers to disable the other X-Men allowing the Inner Circle to abduct Jean. They explained the history of the Phoenix to Jean, claiming that they wanted to eradicate the Phoenix. However, once inside Jean's mind, the Cuckoos followed Sebastian Shaw's order to unlock all of the barriers placed there by Professor Xavier. They intended to release the Phoenix, contain it's power and use it for themselves.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Films</h3><p>The Hellfire Club appears in the 2011 origin movie <a href=\"/x-men-first-class/223-1048/\">X-Men: First\nClass</a> movie where they play the primary villains.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>In the later years of World War II, <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/29-4662/\">Baron Von Strucker</a> created an organization known simply as <a href=\"/hydra/65-3480/\">HYDRA</a>. He divided HYDRA into two branches Advanced Idea Mechanics (AIM) and the <a href=\"/secret-empire/65-15136/\">Secret Empire</a>. The division known as AIM began as a group of scientists who's purpose was to design weapons for HYDRA.</p><p>A.I.M. was responsible for creating the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-adaptoid/29-10861/\">Super-Adaptoid</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>AIM was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Under the umbrella organization known as THEM, Strucker directed the terrorist operations of the Secret Empire, Hydra, and AIM, with a \u201cScientist Supreme\u201d serving as the head of AIM\u2019s own ruling council. When Strucker seemingly perished in the destruction of <a href=\"/hydra-island/34-56352/\">Hydra Island</a>, AIM broke all ties with the Secret Empire and Hydra. The organization eventually succeeded in overthrowing the government of the Caribbean island-nation of Boca Caliente, rechristening it \u201cAIM Island.\u201d However, in recent years, AIM has been plagued by infighting amongst various factions vying for control of the organization. <a href=\"/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a> and Monica Rappcini have fought for the title of Scientist Supreme, a third faction known as Radically Advanced Ideas in Destruction ( <a href=\"/raid/65-41729/\">RAID</a>) broke away to serve the <a href=\"/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a> (Johann Shmidt), while a fourth called Advanced Genocide Mechanics (AGM) surfaced in the Congo.</p><p>AIM has fought against many superheroes and villains alike. And is the focal point of a continuing investigation by <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>. SHIELD even raided a secret android processing facility in the Florida swamps that was funded by AIM. AIM retaliated by raiding SHIELD's base of operations in New York. And as a result, AIM's base was utterly destroyed.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>AIM hired <a href=\"/batroc/29-1529/\">Batroc</a> the leaper to steal for them a substance known as Inferno 42. They also sent a chemical android to dispose of both <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Steve Rogers</a> and <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>.</p><p>AIM has also at one point captured <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> to try and reproduce his famous armor.</p><p>AIM is responsible for infecting <a href=\"/betty-ross/29-3445/\">Betty Ross</a> with Gamma Radiation and turning her into the Harpie.</p><p>For a short time, a power shift in AIM resulted in the faction splitting into two groups the Blue faction and the Yellow Faction. These two factions did battle even dragging <a href=\"/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a> into the fray. The Yellow faction captured <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> and <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> for study. The Blue faction tried to re-create the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a>. But currently neither faction seems active, they seem to have become one unit again.</p><p>AIM succeeded in murdering M.O.D.O.K. when they hired the <a href=\"/serpent-society/65-28980/\">Serpent Society</a>.</p><p>AIM has used jets to assault the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\">West Coast Avengers</a> compound. They launched a microbe into the Stark Space Station.</p><p>AIM has attempted to steal the <a href=\"/quantum-bands/18-42361/\">Quantum Bands</a> from <a href=\"/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>.</p><p>AIM has recently become a techno anarchist group and is no longer affiliated with HYDRA. They also helped in the creation of the <a href=\"/general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\">Red Hulk</a>.</p>",

The Wraiths specialty is the blackest and foulest of magic, and their cruelty is spectacular even by the standards of comic book villainy, with forced mating, torture and appallingly savage murderesses their standard operating procedure.</p><p>The paradise world of <a href=\"/galador/34-57293/\">Galador</a> explored the Dark Nebula over two centuries ago, only to have its fleet annihilated by the Dire Wraiths. The Galadorians created a squadron of star travelling cyborgs called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spaceknights/65-41517/\">Spaceknights</a> to defend Galador, a job they did extremely well ever since.</p><p>A final climactic battle freed Galador, at terrible cost.</p><p>After the battle, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rom/29-2189/\">Rom</a> pursued the Dire Wraiths back to the Dark Nebula, driving them from their ghastly planet <a href=\"/wraithworld/34-56024/\">Wraithworld</a> and scattering them throughout the universe.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rom/29-2189/\">Rom</a> and the other Spaceknights swore a mighty blood oath to hunt down the Wraiths and exterminate them wherever they might be found.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>The Dire Wraiths made their fist appearance in Rom #1, 1979. They were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bill-mantlo/26-42478/\">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/al-milgrom/26-3259/\">Al Milgrom</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The preferred method for the benevolent Galadorian Spaceknights to use was Neutralization, a process where the Dire Wraiths lost their physical host body and were cast into Limbo. The Wraiths preferred death to banishment because in Limbo they could still view the universe, but could not affect it.</p><p>When Rom, their greatest nemesis, arrived on Earth, it was to discover that the males and females of the Wraith species were in a civil war and the native-born Earthling Wraiths and their parents from Wraithworld were also at loggerheads. Female Wraiths use sorcery, males traditionally use science, although there are exceptions such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-dredd/29-69378/\">Doctor Dredd</a>.</p><p>In sorcery they used Deathwings and Hellhounds.</p><p>In addition to their science vs. sorcery preferences, the males prefer their transitory form (resembling a cloudy humanoid) while the females prefer their true form. In their true forms, Dire Wraiths can use their barbed tongue to drill into the skull of another being and steal its memories while duplicating its physical form.</p><p>Whether they use this memory-stealing ability or not, all Wraiths can duplicate the form of virtually any living creature. Dire Wraiths are a deeply xenophobic, totally murderous evil race that is paranoid, secretive and manipulative.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"822424\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001_super.jpg\" title=\"Wraith world being sucked into Limbo\"><img id=\"822424\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/822424-wraithworld001_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wraith world being sucked into Limbo\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wraith world being sucked into Limbo</div></div></div></div><p>The Wraith Home-world was sucked into Limbo by Rom's quick thinking.

Those who could control their abilities but required further training in super heroics formed the basis of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beta-flight/65-41212/\">Beta Flight</a>. The active members in the field who where tasked with dealing with any superhuman threats to the nation were in Alpha Flight.</p><p>James MacDonald Hudson (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardian/29-5047/\">Guardian</a>) had the idea to form Alpha Flight after the public emergence of the Fantastic Four and he was given oversight of Department H which was named after him. Hudson had intended the man known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> to be the leader of Alpha flight. However this task fell to Hudson himself when Wolverine was recruited by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> to become a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>.</p><p>Originally using the codename; Weapon Alpha, Hudson tried to bring Wolverine back to Canada and Alpha Flight by force, if necessary. This led to a battle between Weapon Alpha and and Wolverine's new team, the X-Men. Weapon Alpha was overpowered by their greater numbers and forced to retreat.</p><p>After feeling responsible for injuring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira Mactaggert</a> in the battle, Hudson changed his codename to Vindicator. Several months later the X-Men were forced to make an emergency landing in Canada due to the magic of Alpha Flight's Shaman. Realizing something strange was happening they were soon confronted by the full Alpha Flight team who again wished to bring Wolverine into their custody.</p><p>This first formation of Alpha Flight consisted of Vindicator (as team leader), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sasquatch/29-1478/\">Sasquatch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shaman/29-5017/\">Shaman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/snowbird/29-8474/\">Snowbird</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aurora/29-3189/\">Aurora</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a>.

Alpha Flight burst onto the pages of Marvel in 1979 with their first appearance in the <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">Uncanny X-Men #120</a> as the Canadian government's soon to be disbanded super-hero team.

However a week after they returned the Canadian Prime Minister then delivered the bad news to Hudson. Department H, the secret superhuman arm of the Canadian Ministry of Defense, was being shut down. Allowed to keep his security clearance and the electromagnetic battle suit he designed, Hudson intended to continue protecting Canada as needed, even without the government's help.</p><p>Shortly after arriving home Mac received a call from his former government liaison Gary Cody to alert him to a mysterious phenomena in the northern wilderness. An ancient giant creature known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tundra/29-23484/\">Tundra</a> was being conjured back into existence and was threatening to harm <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/canada/34-55868/\">Canada</a> so Vindicator left to investigate alone. Mac's wife, Heather, fearing for her husbands safety out there alone she went to his office and sent out a call to action to the rest of Alpha Flight through a government computer. Two members of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beta-flight/65-41212/\">Beta Flight</a> had been about to graduate to Alpha Flight just before they were disbanded but were not official members yet were also summoned by Heather to assist Mac. Those two team members; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/puck/29-5010/\">Puck</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marrina/29-12600/\">Marrina</a>, became key figures within the early days of Alpha Flight. Through implanted transponders each member heard the call and although they are spread out across Canada they made their way to the battle with Tundra. All but <a href=\"/puck/29-5010/\">Puck</a> that is, who couldn't arrange transportation to northern Canada and arrived at Mac's and Heather's apartment after they had defeated Tundra. They decided to remain together as a team even without government funding though without Beta or <a href=\"/gamma-flight/65-41227/\">Gamma Flight</a> being called Alpha Flight didn't make sense. It was Puck's insistence that he worked hard to join Alpha Flight and that's what they were going to be called. Hudson changed his code-name from Vindicator to Guardian to punctuate the point that they are Canada's guardians after some prompting from Shaman.</p><p>Some of the former members of Beta Flight and Gamma Flight felt abandoned after Department H's disbanding and were assembled by an enemy of Mac as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/omega-flight/65-31159/\">Omega Flight</a>, Alpha Flight's opposite number. During this battle the Guardian suit was damaged and Mac attempted to disable it but seemingly died in an explosion when interrupted by Heather. Dealing with Mac's death was hard on Heather but eventually Logan and Puck convinced her that she was the right person to lead Alpha Flight. After an apparent return of Mac as part cyborg which turned out to be a ruse she even began to wear a duplicate electromagnetic battle suit and called herself Vindicator. Eventually, the programs in Department H were taken over and perverted for evil purposes and formed the Through deaths and resurrections, strange transformations and sudden reversals, Alpha Flight fought on, loyal to their mission of protecting their homeland. When the last of Alpha Flight had been abducted by the alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/plodex/29-9370/\">Plodex</a>, Sasquatch assembled a new oddball squad. The team consisted of the 97-year-old <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/centennial/29-9369/\">Centennial</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/major-mapleleaf/29-9366/\">Major Mapleleaf</a>, the son of a World War II-era hero, the deadly <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nemesis/29-9367/\">Nemesis</a>, a new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zuzha-yu/29-40717/\">Puck</a> (the original Puck's daughter), and the mysterious <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yukon-jack/29-9368/\">Yukon Jack</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/49-11497/\">New Avengers</a> arc, \" <a href=\"/new-avengers-the-collective/49-21986/\">The Collective</a>\", Alpha Flight were chasing after the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-collective/29-42938/\">Collective</a> empowered Michael Pointer, who had destroyed his home town in Alaska.</p><p>When the team confronted him, he brutally attacked them, killing almost all of them.

In the Shattered Lands, Somon and the other <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/great-beasts/65-15625/\">Great Beasts</a> discuss the situation with Sasquatch, who has in his possession in a mystical power that will enable the Great Beasts to return to Earth, for they claim that they are the only ones with the might to kill the Chaos King. Sasquatch strikes up a deal with them - the Great Beasts will return Sasquatch\u2019s deceased friends to Earth, provided he protects the Great Beasts while they regain their strength. The Great Beasts promise not to attempt to claim Earth for themselves for one hundred years. Sasquatch accepts their deal. In Alberta, Snowbird is reunited with Northstar and Aurora, who felt a strange summons to this location - Sasquatch arrives via a portal - followed by Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman and Marrina! Sasquatch tells his friends that after they returned from Plodex and the team was reorganized before they were slain, that he swore he would find a way to bring them back. The reunion is a joyous one, though it is explained that the rest of their friends were caught up in the chaos in the Underworlds. Snowbird explains who the Chaos King is, before the slave god hordes of the Chaos King arrive. Thinking they are here for her, Snowbird begins to battle them, alongside Guardian and the twins. Sasquatch then explains to his friends the deal he made with the Great Beasts - who are now battling the slave gods. Snowbird is understandably distraught that her deadliest enemies are once more walking the Earth, and tells her friends that if anyone attempts to aid the Great Beasts she will not be accountable for her actions. Sasquatch and Snowbird debate the situation, before several civilians nearby wake from their slumber - though they are transformed into Wendigo, who begin to battle the slave gods.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1528125\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/1528125-attachment_super.jpg\" title=\"The deceased members return\"><img id=\"1528125\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/1528125-attachment_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The deceased members return\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The deceased members return</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually, the heroes agree that the Chaos King is the more pressing concern, so they launch into battle against the slave gods. Aurora tells Northstar that this is where they belong, with their friends, and not with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>. Snowbird witnesses one of the Great Beasts fall to the slave gods - and does not help him. But when the civilians who were transformed into Wendigo begin to eat the slave gods, Snowbird, Vindicator, Shaman and Northstar reconsider the situation, deciding that they do not need anything from the Great Beasts, though it would mean the deceased Alphans will return to what is left of the Underworld. Guardian, Aurora, Sasquatch and Marrina don\u2019t agree though, so the team briefly battle each other. Snowbird and her followers gain the upper hand, and Snowbird uses a god-like power to freeze the Great Beasts. The Chaos King then arrives and seemingly destroys them. The Wendigo return to their true civilian forms, while Vindicator asks about her daughter, to which Sasquatch reveals she is safe with family. Shaman casts a spell to return the four deceased Alphans to a state just beyond life - it doesn\u2019t work, and he, Vindicator, Guardian and Marrina remain on Earth. Shaman realizes that <a href=\"/death/29-12620/\">Death</a> itself is inaccessible, and Snowbird points out that the Great Beasts lied to Sasquatch - that they had no access to their friends, simply without Death there was no place else for them to go. Shaman supposes that when the Chaos King is defeated, Death will be restored. Sasquatch tells everyone that they have to risk defeating the Chaos King, so the eight heroes of Canada depart to join the battle against the Chaos King, and save all of reality.</p><h2>Other Realities</h2><h3>Earth- 1610 (Ultimate)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"387813\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultimate\"><img id=\"387813\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/387813-47771-alpha-flight_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultimate</div></div></div></div><p>The X-men: <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a> and the newest X-Man, <a href=\"/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a>, came up against the Ultimate version of Alpha Flight.

Kaptain Briton fled to Captain Britain's Earth, fought Captain Britain and switched costumes with him, thereby deceiving the pursuing Technet, who then mistakenly took Captain Britain prisoner. The Technet brought Captain Britain to Sat-Yr-9's Earth. There Captain Britain convinced the Technet that he was not the man they had been hired to capture, and the Technet joined Captain Britain in battling the angry Sat-Yr-9's troops. Captain Britain returned to his own Earth, where his sister, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/3176/\">Psylocke</a> had killed Kaptain Briton when he attempted to assault her.</p>\n<p>Later the Technet went to the Wereworlds that were inhabited by people who would turrn into werewolves under a full moon. On the planet Elmo one of the members was fatally wounded and died. Gatecrasher either seriously injured or killed a member of the 'Berserker Pirates' who attempted to interest her in becoming his lover.

Angered by this reversal in their fortunes, all of the members of the Technet except for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yap/14818/\">Yap</a> and Fascination, later known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scatterbrain/29-23441/\">Scatterbrain</a>, left the team.</p>\n<p>Gatecrasher then went to a celebration held by the despot of Kandahar. A person she believed to be the despot himself hired her to procure a perfect mathematical model of the universe that was made of rock crystal and that was held and revered by the Incas of 14th century Peru on Earth 616. Gatecrasher, Yap, and Fascination journeyed through time to obtain the model, but Gatecrasher and Yap were tricked by the person they believed to be a native high priest into consuming fruit filled with the eggs of deadly parasites. Gatecrasher and Yap were thus forced to remain under a cooling waterfall to prevent the eggs inside them from hatching and consuming their bodies from within. In actuality, an alien had impersonated both the despot of Kandahar and the high priest, and hoped to force Fascination into his employ through this convoluted plot. This alien had already succeeded in hiring the members of the Technet who had just left the group. His team was the Special Executive, a future version of the Technet. The team's precognitive told him that Fascination wouldn't join the Special Executive for another 300 hundred years.</p>\n<p>Fascination brought <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/7477/\">Captain Britain</a> and his companion <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/meggan/7604/\">Meggan</a> to 14th century Peru to rescue Gatecrasher. Captain Britain gathered together the plants necessary to create the antidote that would kill the parasite eggs. Gatecrasher and Yap consumed the antidote, and then they, Fascination, Captain Britain, and Meggan returned to their own time period.</p>\n<p>Gatecrasher recruited new members <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/numbers/23440/\">Numbers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/waxworks/14817/\">Waxworks</a> and all the former members except Elmo rejoined.</p>\n<p>Opal Luna Saturnyne hired the Technet to capture Rachel Summers, alias <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix/2164/\">Phoenix</a>, whom Saturnyne claimed was a threat to the universe. At the time Rachel was on the run from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mojo/6755/\">Mojo</a> who had enslaved her to star in his movies and had sent the warwolves after her.The Warwolves and the Technet fought over Rachel and during the fight, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ferro-2/23487/\">Ferro 2</a> was killed. Rachel was saved by Captain Britain, Meggan, and her' fellow X-Men <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>. Together they fought off the Technet, with Gatecrasher feeling for her life, who then retreated. This battle against the Technet led directly to the formation of the team <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/excalibur/14864/\">Excalibur</a> by Summers and her allies. It was later revealed that Saturnyne had hired the Technet under orders of Roma, who needed to form the superhero team to save the multiverse.</p>\n<p>The Technet were allowed to stay in Brighton, England, where they would use their alien technology to provide the city with sunny weather. Meanwhile they would plot to capture Rachel Summers and regain their honor. During this time, they were hired by Sat-Yr-9, who had taken the identity of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/courtney-ross/3431/\">Courtney Ross</a>. The Technet were hired to free <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jamie-braddock/4270/\">Jamie Braddock</a>. They succeeded in their task, but Jamie was taken by Ross and the Technet's memories of their mission were wiped. Gatecrasher then constructed Hardboiled Henry, a living bomb, to ambush Excalibur. The plan succeeded and the Technet nearly defeated Excalibur, but agents of Saturnyne interfered. The Technet received a holographic message from Saturnyne, telling them that they were permanently exiled to Earth 616 and that the bounty on Phoenix was canceled. Furious the Technet turned on Gatecrasher, but Gatecrasher and Yap teleported away. The Technet begged Excalibur for asylum and Nightcrawler told his teammates to accept. The former Technet repaired the damage done by Hardboiled Henry to Excalibur's home. During these repairs Numbers met the dragon living in Excalibur's basement and fell in love with her. The British government came to Excalibur's home for help against an invisible, murderous creature, but only Nightcrawler was home, nursing a broken leg. Nightcrawler trained the aliens to become the N-men and they managed to destroy the creature, but Joyboy disappeared during this mission. Shortly afterward the Special Executive appeared on Earth and told the N-men that they had predicted Earth's destruction to happen within the next few hours. They offered the N-men a job. The N-men agreed and teleported away, together with Numbers, the dragon and their newly born children.</p>\n<p>Excaliber were able to prevent earths destruction and found <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joyboy/14815/\">Joyboy</a> with the Crazy Gang. Here Joyboy had formed a psychic bond with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crazy-gang/14821/\">Crazy Gang</a>'s Red Queen, using his powers to distort her nightmares and form a beautiful land. During this time, Gatecrasher began to go insane, seeing images of Hardboiled Henry, who accused her of making his death meaningless.</p>\n<p>The Technet later reappeared. In this appearance Gatecrasher was the leader once more and Joyboy and Hardboiled Henry had returned as well. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roma/14810/\">Roma</a> had hired them to capture <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> and the Roma came to a agreement and Technet disappeared.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>OTHER MEDIA&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></strong></p>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1457069\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457069-technet3_super.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0\"><img id=\"1457069\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457069-technet3_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0</div></div></div></div>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1457068\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457068-technet2_super.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0\"><img id=\"1457068\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457068-technet2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0</div></div></div></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1457067\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457067-technet1_super.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0\"><img id=\"1457067\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457067-technet1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0</div></div></div></div>\n<p>X-MEN The Animated Series&nbsp;<br />All members of Technet were seen in&nbsp; <strong>Proteus, Part 1 </strong><i>(Episode 49)</i> &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>",

When the world sees the X-Men's death broadcasted worldwide, no-one knows about their reincarnation, least of all their fellow teammates: Shadowcat, Marvel Girl (then Phoenix II) , and Nightcrawler. Because of this, they join Meggan and Captain Britain to form Excalibur. Their base of operations was inside Captain Britain's home, a lighthouse.</p><p>Their first adventure contained within their own title was one of the Warwolves. A group of alien creatures which slightly resembled werewolves. They collected human skins and wore them as a disguise. They had come to earth looking for the skin of Phoenix, but in a mix up at the train station Shadowcat was captured. Her phasing powers complicated their plot, but soon enough the rest of Excalibur arrived to help. This event was the beginning of Excalibur.</p><p>Excalibur took on a more light-hearted tone then the rest of the X-titles. Some of their other early adventures include run ins with villains from both X-men continuity (like Juggernaut) and also incorporated elements and enemies from Captain Britain's Marvel UK adventures (like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gatecrasher/29-14807/\">Gatecrasher</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saturnyne/29-14813/\">Saturnyne</a>). One example is a fight that broke out between Captain Britain and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a>. There is also the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crazy-gang/65-14821/\">Crazy Gang</a>, which was temporarily ran by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arcade/29-8429/\">Arcade</a> and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/murderworld/34-41963/\">Murderworld</a>. More importantly; after a Cross-Time portal opens Excalibur meets many new enemies such as the Lightning Force, an alternate version of Excalibur from Earth-597. Some early themes of the book revolved around each member having issues with their powers.</p><p>The team eventually learns (through Merlyn's manipulations) that Roma, their supposed guardian, set up all the events surrounding their formation. All leading up to Excalibur fighting and defeating Necrom and the Anti-Phoenix.</p><p>Beginning with issue #71, the creative team decided to more closely associate Excalibur with the mainstream X-men books. With the team pared down to just Shadowcat, Nightcrawler and Phoenix (the rest of the team indisposed for various reasons), they moved Excalibur's base of operations to Moira's MacTaggart's Muir Island. Excalibur then filled out its ranks with other X-men characters (such as Wolfsbane and Colossus) as well as bringing Captain Britain (as the mad Brittanic) and Meggan back to the fold.</p><p>The team eventually disbanded to the winds after the wedding of Brian Braddock and Meggan (mostly to facilitate Colossus, Nightcrawler and Shadowcat's return to the X-men.)</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Excalibur was originally created by <a href=\"/alan-davis/26-2348/\">Alan Davis</a>, <a href=\"/paul-neary/26-9570/\">Paul Neary</a>, and the renowned X-Men writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a>. Alan Davis and Paul Neary won an Eisner award for \"Best Comic Book art Team\" in 1989 during their Excalibur stint.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>Original Excalibur</h3><p>Excalibur was formed in Britain, and was composed of British super-heroes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/29-7477/\">Captain Britain</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/meggan/29-7604/\">Meggan</a> as well as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-girl/29-3566/\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lockheed/29-4444/\">Lockheed</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, and a new character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/widget/29-14809/\">Widget</a>.

In an attempt to regain some of his former glory, Juggernaut set out for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/temple-of-cyttorak/34-42362/\">Temple of Cyttorak</a> to reclaim the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/18-41533/\">Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a>, the source of his power as the Juggernaut. The rest of Excalibur followed behind. Closing in on the temple, the team had to deal with their feelings for each other as Cyttorak's power brought out negative emotions between them. This included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nocturne/29-4565/\">Nocturne</a> confronting Dazzler about the way she treated the Juggernaut, revealing Nocturne's feelings for the Juggernaut. After battling his inner demons, Juggernaut and the rest of Excalibur returned to England. While this was a momentary victory for Juggernaut, he brought the gem back not yet knowing what he was going to do with it. The Black Night also left the team to try to uncover the secrets of his sword.</p><p>Recently Nocturne was struck down by a stroke. After weeks of hospitalization and rehabilitation, she is still struggling to regain the use of her body and mind. With the team's support, Nocturne has found the strength to continue trying to reclaim what she used to take for granted. The team has also been having trouble coping with the tragedy, as such an ailment reminds all of their mortality.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><strong>Inferno</strong></h3><p>Following the events with Arcade and the Crazy Gang, Excalibur was thrown into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inferno/39-41408/\">Inferno</a>. As Excalibur lay in deep slumber, Rachel Summers has a shocking dream depicting her brother through her psychic link. Suddenly, without a moments hesitation, she pounces out of bed and flies directly out of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/excalibur-lighthouse/34-56501/\">Excalibur Lighthouse</a>, leaving a gaping hole in the roof. The other members wake up; startled with the noise. Kitty Pryde, Rachel's roommate, attempts to recover from Rachel's uniform psychic attack as she informs the rest of Excalibur what she suspected. Soon, the team had left the Lighthouse, in search of their fellow teammate.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1380022\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68500/1380022-excalibur__6.jpg\" title=\"Excalibur #6\"><img id=\"1380022\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68500/1380022-excalibur__6_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Excalibur #6\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Excalibur #6</div></div></div></div><p>As Excalibur approached <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a>, they realized something was very wrong. The sky had changed colour, with dark shadows crossing the sky. After they reached the City, the team split up. Meggan was caught by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nastirh/29-42869/\">N'astirh</a>, and therefore transformed into the Goblin Princess. Rachel on the other hand, after being over thrown by a pack of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/limbo-demons/65-31912/\">'Limbo Demons'</a>, is suddenly transformed into some sort of 'Plastic Bride.' She is then captured by the demon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crotus/29-29343/\">Crotus</a>, a lowly creature who has finally caught a break. He takes Rachel to the 'Demon Priest,' where they prepare for their <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/excalibur-goblin-morn/37-31100/\">marriage</a>. Nightcrawler is having a bit more luck. He had managed to stay away from the heavy demon attacks, but he instead reflects on his powers. He notices that many objects and places in the city are changing. A great example is the car that grows teeth, and a hunger to go with them. This \"Demon Car\" attempts to eat a crowd of civilians, and Nightcrawler breaks into a fight. As he finished this battle, he finds more inanimate objects becoming alive. This time, a pack of creepy Mannequins.</p><p>Kitty Pryde however is not by herself. She and Captain Britain were together as the local theater came alive! Out of nowhere reels of film were flying about the street, sucking innocents inside, as well as Kitty and Cap. Inside the theater they find a warped reality, with Meggan, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/meggan/29-7604/\">Goblin Princess</a> behind it. Meggan, (possibly subconsciously because of Captain Britain's current behavior) plays with Captain Britain, taunting him. Kitty is rather left alone by Meggan, but is however treated to other horrors. But in this tangible world, Kitty figures out she can control it, and therefore summons <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/soulsword/18-42991/\">Illyana Rasputin's Soulsword</a>! With this she defeats Meggan and saves Captain Britain.</p><p>Soon the events of Inferno are finished, and the team return to normal, although they find that their powers are now getting weaker.</p><h3><strong>Cross-Time Caper</strong></h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cross-time-caper/39-52604/\">Cross-Time Caper</a> occurred when Widget unexpectedly activated himself and transported the Excalibur team and their train across into an alternate world. It was one in which the magic of the earth was very high, leading to Meggan and Captain Britain's powers returning to full capacity. A young knight, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prince-william/29-29154/\">Prince William</a>, sees Shadowcat unconscious and thinks the worst when he sees Lockheed, her pet dragon. When the rest of Excalibur arrives the problem is resolved, but the boy is left with a huge crush on Shadowcat. He therefore asks for her hand. She refuses, but is then taken away and 'transformed' into a real princess. The rest of the team are left on their own, and soon find the prince's real match. After that their train is fixed and they 'jump' on to another world.</p><p>Excalibur then finds themselves in a world similar to their own, but with one small difference. The heroes all seem to be insane and run around fighting each other, killing one another in the blink of an eye. When Galactus sees this, he is outraged, and decides it is best if the world is destroyed as it is to silly. The team just get out before the world collapses.</p><p>We soon find out about the Bounty hunter Gatecrasher and her band of Mercenaries, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/technet/65-14693/\">Technet</a>. They have been sent to earth to find, and capture Phoenix. Unfortunately, she is not there, (she, along with the rest of Excalibur are travelling through alternate dimensions) and with fear of failing her boss, the Technet stay and wait for the Phoenix.</p><p>As we travel to another realm, we see a new situation. The team has been split up, all landing somewhere else. Nightcrawler is on a ship and ends up with a beautiful woman who is by herself. Soon though, space pirates attack the ship and Nightcrawler, thinking that he is helping knocks out the boss. It turns out that she was the heir to the ship after her father died. Nightcrawler is left in a sticky situation, and the rest of the team are not better off!</p><p>Soon, once again the team is transported to an alternate dimension, one in which everyone is constantly racing. The world is the race track and the sport is everything. We also see Jamie Braddock and his mysterious, reality warping powers. This leads to a disturbing sequence involving Meggan and Phoenix changing bodies.</p><p>After we see Jamie Braddock's powers in the alternate dimension, we also see them in the original. It seems that he is controlling his alternate self in a plot to capture the team. Meggan tries to fight him in the alternate world and transforms into different X-Men. In all the confusion Shadowcat enters a portal leading back home, where she is cut off from the team for a long time.</p><p>The others stories we see include a world where Iron Man is Evil, and works for the Shadow King. And another in which Illyana Rasputin's Demon side is shown greatly; in a world where super-humans are hunted and captured. This was committed by a group led by none other than the alternate version of Captain Britain and his sister Psylocke.</p><p>The Cross-Time Caper eventually ended when they were given assistance by an overseer who was fed up with all of the cross-time damage they were responsible for.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-597</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"925102\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48064/925102-lightning_force.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Force\"><img id=\"925102\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48064/925102-lightning_force_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Force\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Force</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality the Excalibur team was known as the <a href=\"/lightning-force/65-56919/\">Lightning Force</a>. This world resulted after the Germans won WWII, therefore the team were Nazi's. One of the members, Shadowcat (who is Jewish), was an enslaved Teammate. As well as this, Captain Britain's counterpart was named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hauptmann-englande/29-14897/\">Hauptmann Englande</a>, and lead the group or mercenaries.</p><h3>Earth-924</h3><p>In this reality the team was known as Calibur. Members were: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/capn-saxonia/29-33102/\">Cap'n Saxonia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-girl/29-3365/\">Spider-Girl</a> who were seen fighting an alternate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kang-the-time-conqueror/29-62455/\">Kang the Conqueror</a> during Excalibur's journey across various alternate realities during The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cross-time-caper/39-52604/\">Cross-Time Caper</a> Saga. They were also seen being flung across several dying universes when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-chaos-wave/12-55753/\">The Chaos Wave</a> (a tidal force of chaotic energies unleashed by a tear in the fabric of time/space that was formed when Earth-616's Scarlet Witch created The House of M reality) tore across The Omniverse, rendering countless worlds asunder. It is unknown whether or not if the members of Calibur survived the disaster.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Ever since <a href=\"/corsair/29-7591/\">Christopher Summers</a> was a boy, he loved the adventures of the swashbuckling heroes of old novels and movies. Even as a major in the United States Air Force, he chose the call sign \"Corsair\" in homage to them. Chosen for the space program, he hoped he would soon travel into space. He got his wish, but not in the way he would have wanted. Following a visit to his parents in Anchorage, Alaska, Major Summers was flying his wife, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/katherine-summers/29-15328/\">Katherine Summers</a>, and his sons, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott</a> (a.k.a. Cyclops) and <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Alex</a> (a.k.a. Havok), down the Pacific coast in his private plane when they were attacked by a <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a> starship. Scott and Alex parachuted to safety, but Major Summers and his wife were teleported aboard the starship and taken back to the Shi'ar throneworld. Their last view of their sons was of their parachute on fire, and they assumed their children had perished. Christopher was imprisoned but escaped only to find Emperor <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dken/29-40902/\">D'Ken</a> attempting to force himself on Katherine. They fought and in the scuffle D'Ken murdered Katherine before Summers' eyes and then sentenced him to the mines of the planet Alsibar. Unknown to Christopher, Katherine was pregnant at the time of her death. This fetus was harvested and aged to adolescence in an incubation chamber. The resulting child, <a href=\"/vulcan/29-21233/\">Gabriel</a> (a.k.a. Vulcan), was raised as a slave of the Shi'ar. After escaping the mines of Alsibar, Corsair and his fellow escaped slaves began a life of piracy in opposition of D'Ken's rule.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Starjammers were created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\">Dave Cockrum</a> in 1977 and first appeared in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/49-2133/\">X-Men</a> # 107.</p><h2>History</h2><h3>Prison Breakout</h3><p>Slowly, Christopher Summers' spirit was broken. This changed when he witnessed some guards viciously beating a fellow slave\u2014a female, catlike alien named <a href=\"/hepzibah/29-13868/\">Hepzibah</a>. Outraged, Summers attacked the guards. Two more of his fellow prisoners\u2014<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chod/29-40789/\">Ch'od</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/raza/29-13869/\">Raza Longknife</a>\u2014came to his assistance. Together, the four stole a spaceship and escaped. Summers took the name Corsair and called his new band of outlaws the Starjammers, sharing their name with <a href=\"/the-starjammer/18-55842/\">the ship they'd stolen</a>. They became rebels and pirates, revenging themselves on the Sh'ar by attacking their spacecraft.</p><h3>Meeting the X-Men</h3><p>The Starjammers helped the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> to stop the Shi'ar Emperor D'Ken's attempt to destroy the universe with the <a href=\"/mkraan-crystal/18-44426/\">M'Kraan Crystal</a>. In gratitude, Lilandra unofficially put an end to the feud between the Empire and the Starjammers. After she was overthrown by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a> found refuge with the team until she regained the Shi'ar throne. Now aware that his two eldest sons survived their crash, Corsair developed a distant but emotional relationship with Scott and Alex, although he remained in space due to his responsibilities with the Starjammers.</p><h3>Corsair's Legacy</h3><p>After Corsair's death at the hands of his youngest son and new Emperor of the Shi'ar, Vulcan. A new group of Starjammers were born determined to bring justice to Vulcan and return Lilandra to her throne as the true Shi'ar Empress. Corsair's second son, Havok, took his father's mantle as leader of the Starjamers. He was accompanied by <a href=\"/rachel-grey/29-3566/\">Rachel Grey</a> (a.k.a. Marvel Girl), Corsair's granddaughter from an alternate timeline, as well as by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/polaris/29-1473/\">Lorna Dane</a> (a.k.a. Polaris). Also on the crew were <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/korvus/29-41208/\">Korvus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/creee/29-10304/\">Creee</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sikorsky/29-14831/\">Sikorsky</a>.</p><h3>Emperor Vulcan</h3><p>Under Havok's leadership the Starjammers use guerrilla tactics against the Emperor's forces while gathering more military forces loyal to the before exiled General <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kaardum/29-58928/\">Ka'Ardum</a> of the Shi'ar Military in effort to even the battle against Vulcan and his military forces who also has the Imperial Guard on his side.</p><p>They however in the middle of an important battle against Vulcan himself who had amassed his own military power where forced to deal with a new very destructive threat intent on destroying the Shi'ar with an incredibly powerful weapon. This brought about the temporary cease fire between the Summer's brothers thus the Starjammers and the Shi'ar till it was dealt with.</p><p>Vulcan however as soon as their mutual enemy was dealt with seized the weapon for his own use and turned on the Starjammers but Havok destroyed the weapon thou not before Vulcan and his Imperial Guard managed to capture both the crew and their ship. With only Marvel Girl, Korvus and Lilandra escaping as they are betrayed by General Ka'Ardum who decides to switch allegiance and sides with Emperor Vulcan.</p><h3>King Breaker</h3><p>Vulcan ships the 4 Starjammers to a new under water prison, The hole, on the planet Kr'nn and proceeds to try and break them over the course of months using various means available to him but remains unsuccessful.</p><p>The 3 remaining free Starjammers in the mean time try to find the location of the rest of their crew while managing to retrieve their ship. They eventually manage to get the answer from Gladiator though. Before they could break them out, they encounter a new set of more ruthless Imperial Guards Vulcan has sent to kill them.</p><p>On Kr'nn Havok frees first himself and his crew and proceed to get control over the prison. Deciding to make a stand right there when Vulcan returns as he has been doing frequently since their capture. The other 3 eventually join up there with the intent of rescuing them when the new Imperial Guard members meet up with them for battle they loose Raza to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zzzxx/29-59546/\">ZZZXX</a> and shortly after are joined by other Imperial Guards including Vulcan and Deathstrike.</p><p>The Starjammers put up a fierce battle unintentionally aided by Gladiator who upon seeing his fellow Strontian who is on the other Imperial Guard team immediately skips the Starjammers and battles her instead. Both Rachel and Korvus mid-battle loose their Phoenix powers that suddenly leaves them. Deathbird attacks Lilandra intent on killing her sister ends up getting impaled by the dethroned impress wounding her critically. Havok having absorbed the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hodinn/29-59512/\">Hodinn</a>, an Imperial Guard who is made up of a star, uses this powerboost to fight Vulcan to the point where he is about to kill Vulcan when Polaris, who has been holding the ceiling from collapsing on them after it was compromised by the Hodinn and Marvel Girls crash entry, states she can no longer hold the ceiling and Lilandra orders an emergency teleport evacuation for her team despite Havok's protest and once aboard the Starjammer the ship makes a quick getaway heading straight to the Kree homeworld, Hala.</p><h3>War of Kings</h3><p>The Starjammers are followed by the Shi'ar all their way to Kree Space where the exiled Lilandra intends to seek audience with the Kree's new King, the Inhuman Blackbolt to grant her asylum from Emperor Vulcan.</p><p>During the Royal wedding between the Kree, Ronan the Accuser and the Inhuman, Crystal. Vulcan's Imperial Guard strike fast and hard before teleporting out. The Starjammers are quick to counter attack but are blitzed and Lilandra is captured, Ch'od looses his hand when trying to stop them from taking her.</p><p>The Starjammers however are quick to go after her from the clutches of the Shi'ar. They accompanied by the new Inhuman Elite strike and board a Shi'ar vessel to retrieve information on her location and proceed to go after them. They encounter the faction of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> sent out as an envoy to meet with Emperor Vulcan and quickly take them along to retrieve Lilandra. The Starjammers together with the Guardians drop in on the Shi'ar ship bring Lilandra back to the Shi'ar Throneworld where she is to stand trial. They are quick to engage the Imperial Guard as they board where Rachel aiding Rocket Raccoon gets the drop on Gladiator till he sees through their trick and proceeds to quickly defeat the two teams but then after Lilandra pleads with him he seems to turn on the Imperial Guards and killing one of them in the process.</p><p>Members Korvus and Rachel Summers of the Starjammers than suddenly lose their connection to the Phoenix Force during a battle. Havok than leads the Starjammers back to earth because of this but Ch'od and Raza Longknife stay behind.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>X-MEN: The Animated Series</h3><p>The Starjammers appeared many times during the Animated series run.</p><p>They were mainly on it during the show's Phoenix Saga Episodes.</p>",

Stryker and his Purifiers believed mutants to be an abomination against God, and a manifestation of the Devil's evil influence on the world.</p><p>Under Stryker's leadership, the Purifiers were successful enough to capture <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> during an attack on the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> which also resulted in the deaths of several mutant children.

While out he discovered the whereabouts of the futuristic <a href=\"/sentinel/29-8299/\">Sentinel</a> called <a href=\"/nimrod/29-13314/\">Nimrod</a>. Stryker used Nimrod in order to witness the affects of <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a> months before it actually happened. Using knowledge of the future gained from the Sentinel's memory system Stryker also saved several human lives, and suggested those incidences were \"miracles\". This enabled him to re-energize support for the Purifiers, and he recruited many new members.</p><p>In the wake of M-Day, and the decimation of the mutant population, Stryker and his forces engaged in brutal attacks on the remaining mutants. Their belief was that God did his part on M-Day, and that it was their job to finish his work by killing the rest. Among their victims were junior X-Men, <a href=\"/wallflower/29-40535/\">Wallflower</a> and <a href=\"/icarus/29-9739/\">Icarus</a>, the former of which was killed by <a href=\"/matthew-risman/29-47984/\">Matthew Risman</a>. Matthew would eventually become the new leader of the Purifiers after Stryker himself was killed by <a href=\"/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a> of the <a href=\"/new-x-men/65-57198/\">New X-Men</a>.</p><p>Matthew Risman's Purifiers are currently one of three groups engaged in a race against time to find the <a href=\"/baby-mutant/29-49329/\">Baby Mutant</a> born since M-Day. The other two are <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>'s <a href=\"/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a>, and the X-Men. Each group has its own agenda regarding the child. Also, since losing his powers, <a href=\"/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a> of <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> Investigation's is now a member of the Purifiers, but secretly spying on them for the X-Men.</p><p>They are now the primary targets of the newly formed <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a>. they recently took hold of one of its members, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>. When the X-Force took her back, they didn't know that they gave some mind-control where Wolfsbane attack <a href=\"/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> and ripped out his wings. Wolfsbane gave them to Risman, in turn, he extracted the technorganic strain from Angel's wings when he used to be <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>'s Horseman of Death. Risman use the strain to make an army of \"angels\" called the <a href=\"/choir/65-57121/\">Choir</a>, that will eradicate the remaining mutants.</p>",

The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a> are the primary team, and then there are many offshoots such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\"> X-Factor</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\"> New Mutants</a>. Generation X formed in 1994 and it changed the formula for the X-books in several ways. They were not mentored by Charles Xavier (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\"> Professor X</a>), they did not train at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\"> Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> and originally the only offshoots from other X-teams were: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\"> Banshee</a>- a somewhat minor character, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a>- a former villain from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\"> Hellfire Club</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jubilee/29-4562/\"> Jubilee</a>-the youngest X-Man. Despite (or because of) these changes in formula, Generation X proved to be very successful. Also, Generation X didn't initially identify themselves as such until later in the book. They trained at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters (later renamed back to its historic <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/massachusetts-academy/34-47788/\"> Massachusetts Academy</a> name when Xavier's got some bad press) and had a Danger Grotto (also known as the Biosphere or the Grotto for short) made from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/65-55854/\"> Shi'ar</a> technology and bits of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krakoa/29-26409/\"> Krakoa</a> the Living Island. Generation X formed as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phalanx-covenant/39-42176/\"> Phalanx Covenant</a>.</p><h2>Generation X Mentors</h2><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\"> Banshee</a></b> (Mentor) - Although Banshee technically wasn't a member of Generation X, he was a mentor and played a large role in their history. Sean Cassidy was a young rich mutant with undiscovered powers. His parents died, leaving him and his cousin <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\"> Black Tom Cassidy</a> with a huge fortune and a castle, Cassidy Keep. Soon, Sean gained complete control over his inheritance; winning his cousin's share in a dice game. Sean later became an Interpol agent and also got married to Maeve Rourke. While he was away on a mission Maeve discovered she was pregnant and gave birth to their daughter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siryn/29-3181/\"> Theresa Cassidy</a>. Maeve was killed soon after in a bomb explosion, so Tom had to take care of Theresa. Sean returned and was devastated from his wife's death and also livid at Tom for not taking care of Maeve. Sean knocked him into a chasm that broke his leg. Tom was vengeful, and promised to get revenge on Sean by never telling him about his daughter. Sean left Interpol (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\"> Deadpool</a> screwed up a mission of his), and went freelance. Sean was discovered by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/factor-three/65-15409/\"> Factor Three</a>, a villain team, and their leader <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/changeling/29-12636/\"> Changeling</a> invited him to join. Sean was horrified and refused, but <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/factor-three/65-15409/\"> Factor Three</a> kidnapped him. He was forced to do their bidding, by a handful of explosives they had placed on him. After working for them for a long time, Sean ran into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a> on a mission in New York. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\"> Professor X</a> easily disarmed the bombs and Sean, codenamed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\"> Banshee</a>, helped the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a> stop <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/factor-three/65-15409/\"> Factor Three</a>. He later accepted an offer an offer of membership into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a>.</p><p>He ran many missions with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a>, fighting criminals and falling in love with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\"> Moira MacTaggert</a>. However, while fighting a criminal (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moses-magnum/29-11915/\"> Moses Magnum</a>) his vocal cords were damaged and he lost his powers. Banshee remained an ally of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a> as his voice and powers gradually returned.</p><p>It was during this time that he learned of his daughter's existence. Theresa had become <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siryn/29-3181/\"> Siryn</a>, inheriting her father's sonic scream. She had thought Tom was her father, and she was overjoyed to learn of her real father's existence. Unfortunately, she felt obligated to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\"> Black Tom Cassidy</a> and was using her powers to help him commit crimes. With Sean's help Theresa reformed and became his partner. He rejoined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a>, but they soon put him in position as the mentor of Generation X.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a></b> (Mentor) - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a> was the other mentor for Generation X. She has spent most of her time as a villain, the White Queen of the \u00fcber-rich, socially elite <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\"> Hellfire Club</a>. She was part of the Inner Circle, the important members, the ones who really mattered(it even included a former Brotherhood member and supervillain, the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\"> Mastermind</a>). The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\"> Hellfire Club</a> plotted world domination which brought them into conflict with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a>. During the ensuing fight, Emma engaged in a psychic battle with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\"> Jean Grey</a>(then called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\"> Phoenix Force</a>). Emma lost, but eventually healed.</p><p>While in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\"> Hellfire Club</a>,Emma established the Massachusetts Academy to train young mutants. Her students,the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\"> Hellions</a>, were rivals of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\"> New Mutants</a> from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\"> Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>. Unfortunately, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\"> Trevor Fitzroy</a>, a powerful time-traveling mutant set loose a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\"> Sentinels</a> attack on Frost and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\"> Hellions</a> to earn points in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/upstarts/65-9727/\"> Upstarts</a> game. All but two (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warpath/29-2158/\"> Warpath</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empath/29-2173/\"> Empath</a>). of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\"> Hellions</a> were murdered, while Emma was left comatose.</p><h2>After Generation X</h2><p>After Generation X, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\"> Banshee</a> was saddened because <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\"> Moira MacTaggert</a> died (killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\"> Mystique</a>). He founded the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-corps/65-40860/\"> X-Corps</a>, a more violent branch of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a> that is more dangerous and affiliated with former criminals from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\"> Magneto</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\"> Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants</a>. He actually was brainwashing the criminals, but <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\"> Mystique</a> stopped him, freed the members, and cut his throat. After healing, he was killed trying to save a jet of civilians. He is currently dead, but he left <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siryn/29-3181/\"> Siryn</a> everything and apologized for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-corps/65-40860/\"> X-Corps</a> problem. He is now dead.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\"> Banshee</a> mutant power was that he had amazingly strong lungs and vocal cords. He could let off a \"sonic scream\". He could let off blasts of deafening noise that paralyze, kill, or incapacitate. He could project sonic blasts that stun, nauseate, disorient, knock out, deafen, or put into a trance his enemies. He could fly at the speed of sound and let off blasts of sound that disintegrated steel.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a> traveled to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\"> Genosha</a>, an island for mutants. It was destroyed in a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\"> Sentinels</a> attack. She survived because of her previously unknown other power-she could turn into a diamond form with enhanced strength and amazing durability. She joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\"> X-Men</a>, and started to training five telepathic quintuplets, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stepford-cuckoos/65-4443/\"> Stepford Cuckoos</a>. One died and the others blamed her. She also had an affair with the depressed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>. Eventually, when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\"> Jean Grey</a> found out, she was furious, easily destroying Emma's telepathic defenses and traumatizing and humiliating her. Emma was shattered emotionally. Soon after, she was shattered physically, in her diamond form. However, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\"> Beast</a> was able to put her together again, and she identified her murderer-one of the four remaining <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stepford-cuckoos/65-4443/\"> Stepford Cuckoos</a>. The girl fled, and the three came back.</p><p>Soon after, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\"> Phoenix Force</a> died, and this left the door open for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>. They led Xavier's school after he stepped down. After she had led the school for a while, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/12-40951/\"> Phoenix Force</a> returned and resurrected <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\"> Jean Grey</a>. Trying to trap the Force, Emma offered her body as vessel. However, it overwhelmed her, and wouldn't leave until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\"> Jean Grey</a> forced it too. Later, her actions allowed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/william-stryker/29-40564/\"> William Stryker</a> to kill young mutants.</p><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\"> House of M</a>, she was married to Cyclops and was one of the two who kept their memory through the event (the other was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\"> Wolverine</a>).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a> is an extremely powerful telepath, and thus possesses all of the normal telepath powers. Sometime after Generation X, she can now also herself into a nearly indestructible diamond form.</p><p>Speaking of indestructible diamond-hard forms, after Generation X, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hollow/29-10573/\"> Hollow</a>'s whereabouts have remained a mystery, assumed to be at the St. Croix estate in Algeria, until recently, when she resurfaced in a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-growth-hormone/12-42280/\"> Mutant Growth Hormone</a> drug dealer facility, in a test tube among other women in test tubes.</p><p>After Generation X, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jubilee/29-4562/\"> Jubilee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skin/29-10566/\"> Skin</a> lived in California.

Chamber was transferred to a private hospital in Britain, but was occasionally visited by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pete-wisdom/29-14819/\"> Pete Wisdom</a>. Chamber was later revived through a serum of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\"> Apocalypse</a>'s blood and encountered the group <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-excalibur/49-18019/\"> New Excalibur</a>, but brushed off their assistance after feeling generally betrayed by his friends with the X-Men. Due to the transfusion of Apocalypse's blood, Chamber's skin turned blue and he developed similar facial features to Apocalypse. A familiar link between the two mutants has since been hinted.</p><p>Jubilee, on the other hand, felt there was nowhere to turn after the X-Men turned away all depowered mutants from their home in the Institute. She was last seen in a mutant half-way house where she was impaled by debris that fell from an explosion Omega Red had started.</p><p>Chamber later joined the New Warriors as Decibel, using power implants similar to those utilized by the Thunderbolt's Songbird. He was joined by his former teammate and friend Jubilee (now taking up the codename Wondra). While Chamber has shown to be more carefree and thankful for his second chance at life, Jubilee has become a jaded field leader often taking note of possible conspiracies. The two are main members of the depowered mutant team and still maintain their close friendship.</p><p>Penance, now known as \"Hollow\", has since been seen with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-loners/49-18461/\"> Loners</a> with a strange affinity towards member-gone-bad <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phil-urich/29-2246/\"> Phil Urich</a> (a former Green Goblin).</p><p>Husk joins the X-Men after their move to San Francisco.</p><p>Skin and Synch were revived during Necrosha and are thought to have died again after the final battle.</p><p>Jubilee has been infected by the vampire virus in recent days during the Curse of the Mutants arc.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth 295 - Age of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"126529\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/126529-118295-generation-x_super.jpg\" title=\"Age of Apolcaypse\"><img id=\"126529\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/126529-118295-generation-x_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Age of Apolcaypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Age of Apolcaypse</div></div></div></div><p>The Generation X of Earth-295 during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\"> Age of Apocalypse</a> was named Generation Next.

The full team battled X-Factor in the next issue seemingly lead by U.S. Senator <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Steven Shaffran</a>. Shaffran was, in fact, a disguised <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mister Sinister</a> who had taken the Senator's form in order to publicly discredit him as a mutant terrorist. While Sinister's reasons for doing this remain somewhat mysterious (as do most of his actions), it was probably because Shaffran was attempting to use his ricochet probability powers. Recently, Nasty Boys member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ruckus/29-13350/\">Ruckus</a> appeared at a meeting for Senator Kelly.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Nasty Boys were created by <a href=\"/peter-david/26-40682/\">Peter David</a> and <a href=\"/larry-stroman/26-13370/\">Larry Stroman</a> in 1992 and first appeared in X-Factor # 75.</p><h3><u>Members of the Nasty Boys</u></h3><p><b><u>Ruckus</u></b></p><p>The leader of the team,possesses the mutant power to absorb ambient sounds, amplify them in his body and scream them back with great force. The resulting sonic attack (a nearby police siren amplified a thousandfold, for example) can be released in the form of a concentrated blast or with a larger area of effect. Ruckus believes himself to be above the law, and tries to show off this superiority at every chance he gets; he once hit a grocery store, severely wounded the store clerk and blasted his way through police just to get some free beer.</p><h4><u>Gorgeous George</u></h4><p>A mutant whose body is composed of an unspecified semi-solid, tar-like substance. In effect, George possesses limited shape-shifting powers enabling him to elongate, inflate, or open holes into his body at will. His semi-solid form gives George a certain degree of resistance to physical harm. Like the other members of The Nasty Boys, not much has been revealed regarding the early life and origin of Gorgeous George. Incidentally, he once got so drunk that he forgot how long his arms were supposed to be.</p><p><b><u>Hairbag</u></b></p><p>He was recruited by Mister Sinister and possesses superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, hyper-keen senses, and resistance to injury. His body is covered in fur and he has razor sharp fangs and claws, as well as flexible hair follicles. During altercations with X-Factor, Hairbag often fought against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>, his opposite. In the Nasty Boys' final fight, Hairbag was captured along with his teammate Slab and taken to a holding cell by X-Factor. While waiting for his lawyer to negotiate bail, Hairbag and Slab were broken out of prison by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-liberation-front/65-28349/\">Mutant Liberation Front</a>. and returned to the Nasty Boys shortly afterwards. In the cartoon, Hairbag has poisonous breath and can eject his hair like a porcupine.</p><p><b><u>Ramrod</u></b></p><p>He can psionically control wood and plants. He always carries with him a staff of wood in order to make certain that he has something to use his powers on should the need arise. He is also an illegal immigrant in the United States. Unlike the other Nasty Boys, Ramrod did not appear in the TV series.</p><p><b><u>Slab</u></b></p><p>He is the team's resident powerhouse, able to increase his size and thereby boost his strength and durability. Slab was the first of the Nasty Boys to appear.</p><h3>OTHER MEDIA<br />X-MEN: The Animated Series</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1457276\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457276-ren21_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1457276\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1457276-ren21_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The Nasty Boysappeared in a few episodes of the series <strong>Reunion, Part 1 &amp; 2</strong> <i>(Episode 25 &amp; 26)</i> they were henchmen for Mr. Sinister.</p>",

        "description":"<a> </a> <h2>Gene Nation</h2> <p><strong>First Incarnation</strong></p> <p>When the mentally unstable Mikhail Rasputin flooded the Morlock tunnels, many were believed dead. However, at the last instant Mikhail used his powers to open a portal into a parallel dimension dubbed The Hill. In this dimension, time moves at a faster rate, and even though it was a matter of months in the main <em>Marvel Universe</em>, it had been between 10-20 years In the Hill. On the anniversary of the Mutant Massacre, a horrific event in which Mr. Sinister's henchmen the Marauders killed many Morlocks, the members of Gene Nation reappeared in the main universe ( Earth-616). Their mission was to destroy one human for every Morlock life that was lost, and also, in a side mission performed by Hemingway and Marrow, to kill some of the original Morlocks. In Marrow's eyes, Leech, one of the few to survive the massacre, was weak and instead of defending his people he hid like a coward. Fortunately, the White Queen, who was trying to recruit Leech to her teenage mutant team Generation X, is able to thwart their efforts. However, with the intervention of the Dark Beast Marrow and Hemingway escape. Afterwards, a team of X-Men and the Morlock Callisto confront an attack group from Gene Nation including Marrow, Hemingway, Reverb, Sack, and Vessel. In order to assure that their mission succeeds, Marrow alerts the X-Men that she has a bomb strapped to her heart. Seeing it as the only way of stopping the terrorist, Storm rips out Marrow's heart. Callisto takes the remaining members of Gene Nation back to The Hill. A few months later, Storm is kidnapped by Mikhail and taken to The Hill. Once there she has to fight her way to the top of the hill where Mikhail lives, where she successfully overpowers him. Having won the victory, Storm forces Mikhail to take all of the people living on The Hill back to the real world. In an effort to give the mutants a new start, she settles them in a village outside of her home town in Africa. Unfortunately this village is later attacked by anti-mutant extremists and many members of Gene Nation are murdered. However, they wouldn't get much of a chance to start over because shortly after they were placed in Africa the Dark Beast gathers some of the original members, along with some new recruits, to form a new team. The express purpose of this team is to capture test subjects for the evil genius, namely the students of Generation X. They succeed in capturing all but the White Queen and the newcomer Gaia and, with the help of Nate Grey, also known as X-Man, they liberate her charges.<br /><br /><strong>Weapon X: Days of Future Now</strong></p> <p>In the five-issue miniseries Weapon X: Days of Future Now, on Earth-5700 in an alternate future of our own timeline, Gene Nation appears in issue #4 twenty-four years in the future when Magneto assembles the various teams of the world in the face of a common threat: the Sentinels.</p> <p><strong>Members</strong></p> <p><a> </a></p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li><strong>Charm</strong> - heightened strength, agility, and reflexes </li> <li><strong>Hemingway</strong> - can greatly increase his size and mass, also has bone spikes protruding from his back and forearms that can be used offensively </li> <li><strong>Loss</strong> - razor sharp bone spikes on her wrists </li> <li><strong>Marrow</strong> - heightened bone growth causes them to grow beyond her body where they can be removed and used as weapons, also an increased healing ability to seal the holes made by the removal of bones </li> <li><strong>Reverb</strong> - project his psychic talents into the environment around him, giving him an uncanny awareness of his surroundings, also uses his abilities to mentally cripple others </li> <li><strong>Sack</strong> - semi-liquid form allows him to encase the bodies of others in a clear membrane that allows him to control that person until they asphyxiate </li> <li><strong>Vessel</strong> - absorbs the \"souls\" of the recently deceased to increase his size, strength, and invulnerability </li></ul> <p>Note: Callisto showed a video to the X-Men about Gene Nation that showed Ever as a member; however he never made an appearance with them.

        "description":"<h2>Origin of the Marvel Zombies</h2><b>Note: The comics described on these pages are parental advisory comics, so only read when old enough.</b><br />The Marvel Zombies made their first appearance in the \"Ultimate\" Marvel universe ( a different reality then the main 616 universe) in witch the \"Ultimate\" Reed Richards comes into contact with a Reed RIchards from another universe. At first, Reed (and the reader as well) think that this is the 616 Reed Richards.<br />However, nothings seems to be further from the truth. The Ultimate Reed uses a time device to go to this other universe and finds it in total ruins. It turns out that there had been a plague on this earth witch had consumed almost every living creature and turned every super-powered being into a flesh eating, zombie-like entity.&nbsp; It started with a ripple in the sky and a costumed person falling down from there. The Avengers of this earth investigated the strange occurrence. They found a Zombie like being lying on the streets that was similar to Superman of DC Comics, although it was later rett-cont to be the Sentry, a Marvel character. Captain America (in this universe known as Colonel America) was one of the first on the scene, and was also the first to be bitten by the Sentrty Zombie. During the time the chaos broke out, a time displaced <a href=\"../../ash/29-11302/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                 Ash</a> tried warning the heroes, whom didn't think much of his calling outs.  Things happened fast from that point on. Although the superheroes fought the good fight, many where turned to zombies (perhaps because of their lack of experience, since this universe seemed younger and coming right out of the 1970's). Once bitten, the heroes would turn into a zombie-like state, not being able to stop their unsatisfying hunger for flesh. Most heroes who where bitten started eating regular people or tried to change other superheroes to zombies. Even Spider-man was bitten, but tried to hold of the hunger as long as he could. He saved Ash from seeming death and told him to take refugee. That was one of the last good actions of Spider-man in this universe. He went to his home where his wife Mary-Jane and aunt May where, but was already a Zombie the moment he entered the house. A shocked Aunt May and Mary-Jane saw Peter changing. Spider-man warned them one last time, but the hunger was no longer controllable and he finally started devouring his most loved ones. A tragic end. Although the incident soon became national, it became international when the hero Quicksilver was bitten. After he became a Zombie he ran so fast that he actually ran over water, over the ocean, to Europa. There he started a new plague. It was not before long that major super teams such as the X-men where also changed into zombies and only a handful of heroes remained. A final major battle erupted, but was lost. The remaining heroes held the zombie-horde back long enough for some humans to retreat to another universe through a dimensional-portal, and then destroyed the portal so that no other universes would be contaminated with the zombie plague. <br /><br />At the other side of the world, <a href=\"../../ash/29-11302/\" rel=\"nofollow\">                Ash</a> managed to take a few superheroes, including the Dazzler, to Latveria; One of the last major strongholds of human resistance and the home-state of Doctor Doom. Although it did not take long before also these defenses where breached. Doom however took his role as lord of his people serious, and held the zombie horde back all by himself, letting hundreds of his people escape through a portal to another dimension. So, whatever can be said of Doom, he truly did love his people, and even sacrificed his life for them. Ash was one of the people whom managed to get away from the dimension, unfortunately losing his pall Dazzler, whom was bitten by the Zombie <a href=\"../../enchantress/29-7225/\" rel=\"nofollow\">               Enchantress</a>. After this event, the world seemed all but lost, most superheroes where changed, and much of the human population was dead or changed. (However, some heroes and normal humans managed to hide, even from the super-zombies' powers).The was Problematic for the Zombies, as they where running out of food. This is reason the zombie version of Mr. Fantasic contacted the \"Ultimate universe\" Reed Richards, hoping to open a gate through witch the Zombies could spread their plague. Some zombies, namely the zombie counterparts of the Fantastic Four, even \nmanaged to get into the \"Ultimate Universe\", although they were captured in a near-impervious room. Back on the Zombie World, Reed managed to escape the Zombie hordes thanks to Magneto, who was giving asylum to survivors. Together with the humans, Reed escaped, back to the Ultimate universe through a last remaining dimensional-portal, witch after use was destroyed by Magneto whom stayed behind, so that the zombies could not follow. <br /><br /><h3>Marvel Zombies 1, the first limited series.</h3>The first Marvel Zombies limited series follows right after the events \nof the Ultimate FF story. Magneto closed the gate to the Ultimate \nUniverse, but now Erik is standing alone against an army of Marvel \nheroes turned zombie. He flees and manages to escape the zombies for \nsome time by hiding in the sewers. There he contacts his Acolytes; a\n group which is still safe on his Asteroid M headquarters. Right before he can be picked up by his friends, the Zombies find \nMagneto. He puts up a huge fight and manages to take all the zombies \nout, except for Wasp, who sneaked up behind him. He is bitten and after \nthat all the zombies turn on him once more. Magneto is killed almost \ninstantly. However, resistance is still there. After the feast, the \nZombie Hank Pym (Giant Man) returns to his hide-out, where he secretly \nkeeps a still human Black Panther on an operating table. The zombie Hank\n Pym is trying to find a cure, and in the meantime trying to sustain his\n desire to eat the Panther. He has already taken an arm off of him, as \nwell as a leg. But the moment Hank is done with talking to the Panther, \nthe Wasp shows up, seeing Hank and the Panther together. She rushes out,\n wanting to warn the other zombies of the secret Hank has been keeping. \nHank however beheads her before she can do anything. A gruesome scene, \nbut the Wasp's head remained intact, and so she still lives. Hank kept \nher from the other zombies. Later on the zombies meet in the center of \nNew York city, each having their own problems, the zombie Spider-man had\n half his leg broken when fighting Magneto, just as Colonel America had \nhalf his head cut open with his own shield, also courtesy of Magneto. \nWhile the zombies are bickering, the suddenly see a strange silver \nentity flying by. It is the <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">     Silver Surfer</a>&nbsp;<a> </a>. He had come to this world in order to scout and see if it was a good planet for his master <a href=\"../../galactus/29-2149/\" rel=\"nofollow\">      Galactus</a>\n to eat (much like what happened in the regular 616 Main Marvel \nUniverse). The Surfer first encountered the zombies and tries to slay \nthem after they attack him (wanting his flesh). He manages to take a lot\n of them out, but soon is overwhelmed and he tries to flee. This however\n stops the moment the Surfer encounters the Hulk zombie, who literary \neats his head off, after witch a few zombie heroes eat the remains; the \nzombies who ate him where Iron Man, Colonel America, Hulk, Wolverine, \nLuke Cage and Giant Man. This not only satisfied the hunger of the \nzombie heroes, but also gave them, strangely enough, the Power Cosmic \nthat the Silver Surfer had. Feeling insane with power, the 6 cosmic \npowered zombies slaughtered most of their other zombie heroes, in hope \nthat a barbecued zombie would taste better (the zombies could not eat \neach-other because of the bad taste). This was however not the case. In \nthe meantime, the Black Panther managed to escape the Zombie hordes and \ntook the head of the Zombie Wasp with him, he mad a crutch for himself \nso he could walk. Once in the city, the Panther was found by the still \nnot infected <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Acolytes</a><a> </a>,\n Magneto's team. They had come looking for him after contact between \nthem was broken. After a fight, the Panther managed to convince the team\n to take him and (a remorseful) Zombie Wasp with them to Astroid M, \nwhere they would be safe. In the meantime, the zombies' problems got \neven worse, when both the villain zombies as well as Galactus himself \nshowed up, ready to drain the power of the zombie-world. A huge fight \nbroke out, in witch Colonel America was 'killed' (if you can still call \nit that) by the Zombie Red Skull. Galactus in the meantime defeated \nhordes of zombies quite fast. However, thanks to the Power Cosmic and an\n incredible machine made by Hank Pym witch linked their Cosmic powers \ninto one single ray of power, the zombies actually managed to get \nGalactus down on his knees. The zombies soon overwhelmed the half-God \nand he too was eaten. Skip forward in time, several years later, an \naircraft lands in the New York City vicinity. Aboard are the Black \nPanther (with two robot limbs) his wife and newly born son, the mutant \nX-man Forge, the Zombie Wasp (now with a robot body), and other \nAcolytes. The whole city, and for that matter the whole planet seemed \ndeserted. The Black Panther and his allies could finally re-inhabit the \nearth. The one question that remained was, \"where did the Zombies go \nto?\". Somewhere far far away, on an alien planet, all warning signs go \noff, it turns out 'the Galactus' has come. But this time, it is not the \nGalactus as we know, but the Zombies, in Galactus outfits, a plague that\n is now consuming the whole universe.",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The original X-Force was formed from members of the <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a> by <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a>, adding in several others he saw fit to carry out his vision of a more forceful interpretation of <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>'s vision for mutantkind. As such the roster included: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, who later became team leader <a href=\"/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a>, <a href=\"/sunspot/29-4644/\">Sunspot</a> and <a href=\"/boom-boom/29-2159/\">Boom Boom</a>, and added <a href=\"/domino/29-2161/\">Domino</a> (actually <a href=\"/copycat/29-13311/\">Copycat</a> posing as her at first), <a href=\"/feral/29-2160/\">Feral</a>, <a href=\"/shatterstar/29-2156/\">Shatterstar</a>, <a href=\"/warpath/29-2158/\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"/banshee/29-3181/\">Siryn</a> and <a href=\"/jesse-bedlam/29-15329/\">Bedlam</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>X-Force was a team created by illustrator <a href=\"/rob-liefeld/26-5181/\">Rob Liefeld</a> after he began penciling the comic <i>New Mutants</i> in 1989. As the popularity of Rob Liefeld's art grew, he became the key artist and penciler of the book and he was able to create many characters that were associated with the X-Force like Cable. With help from Fabian Nicieza, Rob turned The New Mutants into the X-Force and launched a new comic entitled <a href=\"/x-force/49-4604/\"><i>X-Force</i></a> #1 in 1991.</p><p>After a long run, the team disbanded and a new X-Force was formed years later with a completely different roster and purpose. The team was Cyclops' secret hit squad, the series was written by <a href=\"/craig-kyle/26-40892/\">Craig Kyle</a> and <a href=\"/christopher-yost/26-40897/\">Christopher Yost</a> and the art was handled by <a href=\"/clayton-crain/26-9396/\">Clayton Crain</a> and <a href=\"/mike-choi/26-40898/\">Mike Choi.</a> The team and the book were extremely popular but were cut due to story telling and the writing team moving on to different things. However, a new team and book was made called <a href=\"/uncanny-x-force/49-35835/\">Uncanny X-Force</a>, created by <a href=\"/rick-remender/26-44849/\">Rick Remender</a> and <a href=\"/jerome-opena/26-56325/\">Jerome Opena</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76705\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76705-22538-new-mutants_super.jpg\" title=\"The team's first appearance\"><img id=\"76705\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76705-22538-new-mutants_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The team's first appearance\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The team's first appearance</div></div></div></div><p>X-Force at first mainly fought the terrorist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-liberation-front/65-28349/\">Mutant Liberation Front</a>, led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stryfe/29-7616/\">Stryfe</a>, who was Cable's archenemy and clone.

Soon, the team was thought dead, but had only disbanded and gone underground.</p><p>Then, a media team was formed and usurped the name X-Force, eventually changing it to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-statix/65-11485/\">X-Statix</a>. The majority of the former members of X-Force joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-corporation/65-40425/\">X-Corporation</a>, although briefly Cable reformed X-Force to help combat <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skornn/29-9638/\">Skornn</a>, an ancient alien. Several members of X-Force went on to join other teams; however, Domino, Shatterstar and <a href=\"/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> continued acting as part of the team, especially when they organized an assault on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Mansion</a> to free the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/198/12-48559/\">198</a>.</p><p>X-Statix was eventually canceled, and the only appearance of an X-Force team was in a 4-issue miniseries in 2004. This situation stood until the events of the <a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a> storyline when <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> authorized <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> to form a new mutant team that would secretly operate and use lethal force to deal with threats to the X-Men.</p><p>The new <a href=\"/x-force/49-20511/\">X-Force</a> that Wolverine assembled included Warpath, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>, <a href=\"/x-23/29-3560/\">X-23</a>, <a href=\"/hepzibah/29-13868/\">Hepzibah</a> and <a href=\"/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a>. After Messiah Complex, Caliban was dead and Hepzibah was left out of the line-up. The team was later joined by <a href=\"/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>, Domino, <a href=\"/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a> and <a href=\"/vanisher/29-6756/\">Vanisher</a>.</p><p>The conclusion of the <a href=\"/second-coming/39-55971/\">Second Coming</a> storyline brought Wolverine's X-Force team to an end as the existence of this deadly team was made known to the other mutants, even resulting in the departure of <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> from the X-Men. Little did Cyclops know that Wolverine had other ideas. Behind Cyclops' back Wolverine formed yet another secret X-Force team, with <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a>, <a href=\"/fantomex/29-4281/\">Fantomex</a>, Angel and <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> forming the initial line-up.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>A new X-force team; Messiah CompleX</h3><p>In the middle of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah CompleX</a> storyline, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> assembled a new X-Force, which consist of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>'s best trackers. The new team is made out of Wolverine as team leader, X-23, Warpath, Wolfsbane, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hepzibah/29-13868/\">Hepzibah</a>. Their first mission was to track <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a> and the newly discovered <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baby-mutant/29-49329/\">Baby Mutant</a>, before the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purifiers/65-14915/\">Purifiers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/reavers/65-9726/\">Reavers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/predator-x/29-47143/\">Predator X</a> could get them first. They also participated in the final battle against the Marauders on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a>. However, after the death of Caliban and injury of Hepzibah, it was believed that X-Force was disbanded.</p><h3>Angels and Demons</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"679390\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11233/679390-xforce1_super.jpg\" title=\"The new X-Force\"><img id=\"679390\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11233/679390-xforce1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The new X-Force\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The new X-Force</div></div></div></div><p>In the aftermath of Messiah Complex, Cyclops reassembled X-Force once again. Wolverine did not want X-23 or Warpath involved, but they refuse to leave when given the opportunity. Wolverine did not press the issue, believing that they had the right to choose their own destiny. Their first mission, after the events of the Messiah Complex, was to infiltrate a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> facility, where a group of Purifiers have stolen valuable technology needed to resurrect a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinel/29-8299/\">Sentinel</a> named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bastion/29-40568/\">Bastion</a>. Complications arose when that same group captured Wolfsbane, prior to their arrival, and threatened to shoot her. X-23 thought it was a bluff and attacked anyway, by detonating explosive charges that she had placed and armed off panel. Wolfsbane was seemingly shot by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/matthew-risman/29-47984/\">Matthew Risman</a>, head of The Purifiers, in the face. It was later revealed that Risman actually shot Wolfsbane in the knee. Risman then took Wolfsbane to Purifier headquarters while the rest of X-force return to Angel's mansion, where Wolverine yelled at X-23 for disobeying his orders. X-23 stated that her mission was never to protect her teammates but to kill Matthew Risman, and Cyclops backed her up. When they were able to save Wolfsbane, they returned to Angel's mansion and summoned Elixir to heal her. When she woke up, she attacked Elixir, X-23 and Angel. During this attack, she had ripped off Angel's wings and took them to the Purifiers, to be used to build an army of angels that will serve to eradicate the remaining mutants. Angel awoke as Archangel ready to kill X-Force but X-23 was prepared to fight off his attacks. Unlike with Wolfsbane, Wolverine had said nothing about dying for Angel. In the middle of the fight, Archangel flew to the location of the Purifiers with the X-Force following him. Meanwhile, the leaders of the Purifiers were having a standoff on who is the rightful leader. Before the argument escalated, Archangel went on a killing spree; targeting the choir and demanding his wings back, while the X-Force went on the attack as well. In another part of the facility, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/reverend-craig/29-14853/\">Reverend Craig</a> was hunting down Wolfsbane, saying that she is condemned to be a demon. He was then later attacked by Wolfsbane, presumably killing him. The X-Force managed to defeat the Purifiers but not completely, as Bastion and his resurrected puppets of prominent, former, X-Men enemies were able to escape. As at the end, it is shown that Archangel presumably returned back to normal. Back at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angels-aerie/34-55689/\">Angel's Aerie</a>, they report back to Cyclops on what happened and now decides on who is next in their hit list.</p><h3>Old Ghosts</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"440305\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Force #7\"><img id=\"440305\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/440305-x_force_clayton_crain07cv_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Force #7\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Force #7</div></div></div></div><p>Back at home, the X-Force investigates what could have triggered the transformation of Angel and the triggered rage of Wolfsbane. They also thought about what to do with Elixir, since he now knows too much about the X-Force. They thought about killing him, but X-23 called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stepford-cuckoos/65-4443/\">Stepford Cuckoos</a> to erase Elixir's memories about the X-Force. But before they could do this, the team saw <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">Graydon Creed</a> on TV, saying that the assassination on him was just a cover-up to protect himself. They want to go after him, but Cyclops stop them because that have to go after Vanisher first because he has taken hold of a strain of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legacy-virus/12-42281/\">Legacy Virus</a>. They all go except for Warpath, who goes home to visit the grave of his brother but was suddenly attacked by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon-bear/29-15552/\">Demon Bear</a>. He was almost killed if it weren't for the intervention of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-rider/29-4268/\">Ghost Rider</a>, who help Warpath escape the creature.</p><p>X-Force tracks down Vanisher in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a> but they also run in with Domino, who tagged along to find the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legacy-virus/12-42281/\">Legacy Virus</a>. When they manage to find Vanisher, they interrogated him through Elixir's powers inducing a brain tumor, which prompted Vanisher to tell them that he had lost the Legacy Virus to a fight with the clones of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a> that was awakened when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mister Sinister</a> died. When the X-Force got to the place where Vanisher lost the Legacy Virus, Domino manage to find it, but as they were about to leave with it, but are quickly attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-right/65-56070/\">The Right</a> who is there to take it into their possession. X-Force fight back, X-23 fighting the Right members with the virus. But as they fight, X-23 drops the virus and is stabbed at the same time, the virus being released into her body. She decides after killing the Right member by popping her claws into his head, to kill herself by jumping into a vat of furnace to destroy the virus along with her. The other members of X-Force cover Elixir as he chases after X-23 hoping to save her. He catches up with her, but she still jumps off. Luckily, Elixir catches her hand, and purges the virus out of her. This however took too much out of him and he drops her. Later, she's revealed to be alive, Josh managing to divert her course slightly, and she caught on fire, burning her hair away and her skin. She took Josh's clothes and left him in his underwear.</p><p>Back with Warpath and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-rider/29-4268/\">Ghost Rider</a>, and Ghost Rider tells him the story of the ancient magic invoked by the elders of the Apache, and how he can channel their shamanistic powers to help him fight the Demon Bear which they call it \"The Ghost Dance\". The two quickly attack the Bear, slashing at it. Suddenly, Ghost Rider notices the Demon Bear had a knife stuck in its hide. He alerts Warpath, who removes it. The Demon Bear then releases totemic spirits, Ghost Rider revealing them to be the Apache gods, corrupted by the knife. The Gods then showed Warpath who they're true enemy was. Back with Wolfsbane, and she's in the forest, searching for someone in the forest. Suddenly, the creature makes an appearance, revealing himself to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgardian-gods/65-41205/\">Asgardian God</a> of Wolves and her former lover, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hrimhari/29-45354/\">Hrimhari</a>. All of them meet back at Angel's mansion, the X-Force team from Japan having recaptured the Vanisher and gagged him. They see Warpath on the floor, and ask him what's wrong. He tells them that his entire tribe has been dug up, including his brother Thunderbird. When they all ask who, and Warpath replies: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eli-bard/29-59642/\">Eli Bard</a>.</p><h3>Suicide Leper</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"620113\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/620113-x_force_clayton_crain12cv_super.jpg\" title=\"Suicide Mission\"><img id=\"620113\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/620113-x_force_clayton_crain12cv_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Suicide Mission\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Suicide Mission</div></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/friends-of-humanity/65-40563/\">Friends of Humanity</a> are holding a rally in Iowa, at which they condemn mutants yet again, shouting blasphemy about them and so on.

Cyclops arrives to find Domino laughing at a Vanisher who's screaming in pain, X-23 having cut off his ear after he'd tried to persuade Elixir to heal his tumor. Cyclops informs them of the incident with Beautiful Dreamer, and they debate, until Vanisher makes another comment and X-23 offers to torture him some more.</p><p>X-Force split up: Archangel and X-23, Vanisher and Warpath and Domino and Wolverine.

Having been denied the death she was hoping for, Leper Queen shoots Boom-Boom in the head, killing her.</p><h3>Messiah War</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"801812\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11233/801812-xforcecable_super.jpg\" title=\"Messiah War\"><img id=\"801812\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11233/801812-xforcecable_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Messiah War\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Messiah War</div></div></div></div><p>X-Force find themselves having traveled 900 years into the future on their next mission; to protect Cable and the supposedly mutant messiah, Hope. Elixir complained about going back to the present to save their friends that were left behind. Wolverine promised him that they will. Logan then ordered Vanisher to teleport and scout ahead, but Telford claims that his powers are somehow being blocked. Following that, Vanisher was suddenly shot in the neck, causing X-Force to take cover from the unknown sniper. It later turned out to be Deadpool, who was still very much alive as a result of his healing factor. Wade told the X-Force that Cable will be at the old Xavier Institute. Now with some heading, they set out to finish their mission.</p><p>Suddenly, X-23 picked up Cable's scent and began tracking him. When Wolverine was about to face Cable, he instead met up with Hope, with Cable pointing a gun in his temple. Wolverine informed Cable that they were sent to the future by his father (Cyclops) to help him against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a>. Cable had news of his own, and he updated the other time travelers that Bishop was in league with Stryfe, Cable's clone.</p><p>When X-Force and Cable were attacked by Stryfe's army: Hope, Elixir and Vanisher escaped the skirmish. A division in the ranks occurred when Angel was drawn away by a voice whispering in his mind. When the battle is over, Cable warned Vanisher not to take away Hope from him. They were then attacked by Stryfe directly, who soundly defeated them one by one. Even as Cable detonated a bomb within Stryfe's armor, it was useless. Stryfe captured both Hope and Warpath. Running out of time, the X-Force split up into two teams; X-23, Domino, Vanisher and Deadpool will look for the power source that has been blocking Cable's time traveling and Vanisher's powers, while Cable, Wolverine and Elixir rescue Hope and Warpath.</p><p>When Stryfe brought them to citadel, Bishop makes his move on killing Hope, but he was stopped by Stryfe. He was then able to read his mind and know Hope's significance. Hope removed Stryfe's helmet and she ask if he is Cable. Warpath was able to destroy his restraint and attack Stryfe but he was defeated when Hope distracted him. It was then that Bishop retaliated to Stryfe but he destroyed his cybernetic arm. Stryfe was then attacked by Cable using his psionic power, which supposedly burned out. Stryfe defeated his \"brother\" but it was a planed distraction for Wolverine and Elixir attack from behind.</p><p>While Domino's team is looking for the source, Deadpool admitted that he has been hearing Stryfe in his mind and he plans to kill the X-Force. When they found the source, Laura was surprise that the source of the block is her friend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kiden-nixon/29-40702/\">Kiden Nixon</a>, who was kidnapped by Bishop and Stryfe from the present and hooked on into a machine that strengthen her powers to block anyone who can manipulate time and space. As time runs out, the X-Force begins to experience the negative effects of their time-traveling armbands. Kiden asks Laura to kill her as it is the only way to prevent them from being killed, but she is hesitating. It wasn't until Domino shot Kiden in the head that the time-space warp had stop. Vanisher wondered why weren't they killed by their armbands but before Domino could come up with an answer, Vanisher pressed the armband and he backtrack in time to the present. Deadpool arrived and blasted Stryfe with a laser cannon but Stryfe ripped him in half. With Deadpool dead and the other team attacking Stryfe still feeling the effects of the armband on their body, Stryfe moves in for Hope, but everyone was surprise that Apocalypse barges in, being accompanied by his horseman of death, Archangel. Together, they defeated Stryfe, with Apocalypse delivering the final blow.</p><p>As this was going on, Bishop takes aim at Hope, but he was too weak to shoot. Apocalypse carried Hope into his arms and was about to kill Bishop, but he time-traveled to escape. Apocalypse took interest on Hope as his potential host, but Cable and X-Force surrounded him, with Logan asking Warren on which side he was on. Warren told Apocalypse that he had owed him his life by sparing his own, and he demanded Hope to be returned to them and Apocalypse agrees to this, but not before Apocalypse warned Cable that he will come back for the child. As X-Force left the citadel, Apocalypse is seen dragging Stryfe's weakened body to become his new host. Wolverine then ordered Cable to time-travel with Hope and X-Force splitting up again with Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir going to the UN, while X-23 prematurely cuts off Warpath and Domino's armband and goes to save Boom Boom alone.</p><h3>Not Forgotten</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"804206\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/804206-132_x_force_18_super.jpg\" title=\"Not Forgotten\"><img id=\"804206\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/804206-132_x_force_18_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Not Forgotten\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Not Forgotten</div></div></div></div><p>All members of X-Force came back at the same moment they left to jump forward in time. X-23 was able to kill Leper Queen before she could kill Boom-Boom. Before dying, she thanked X-23 for setting her free from Bastion's control. X-23 then collapsed from the fatigue she experience from time-travel. It that moment that agents of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammer/65-56065/\">HAMMER</a> storm in and apprehended their primary target, X-23. Boom-Boom was left with two HAMMER agent with one of them about to rape her, when she was saved by Warpath. Meanwhile in the UN, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/surge/29-40509/\">Surge</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a> tries to escape from their captors but the Legacy Virus within them begins to flare out. Angel and Wolverine came in just in time with Elixir who was able to purge the virus in Hellion's body and barely saved Surge's life, but her powers became out of control and was about to explode. Luckily, Hellion redirected her energy to the sky before passing out. Back in their base, Beast and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-james-bradley/29-29259/\">Dr. Bradley</a> evaluate Hellion and Surge medical condition as normal.</p><p>In an undisclosed location, X-23 is reunited to her old handler from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-facility/65-48035/\">Facility</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kimura/29-41489/\">Kimura</a>, who begins to torture her by dismembering her arm. In a corridor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-young/29-57787/\">Agent Young</a> told Agent Morales that he was a Facility member that infiltrated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> and he also discussed to her about joining the facility. Stating she knew that if her answer were to be no, death would be the final penalty. So without hesitation, Agent Morales took out Young and escapes to rescue X-23. Kimura was about to chop off Laura's second arm, but a bullet was shot in her head, knocking her off and the shot came from Agent Morales' gun. Upon getting X-23 out of the chains, Morales couldn't understand why this child was still standing. Before questions could be answered, Kimura threatened to kill Morales. X-23 told Morales to run and both women fled the scene with Kimura not that far behind. X-23 manage to pin down Kimura into a steel door and she and Morales got locked up into a laboratory where the Facility creates large amounts of trigger scent that forces X-23 to go into a berserker rage.</p><p>X-23 tells Morales to take shelter after giving her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adamantium/18-40759/\">adamantium</a> claws and triggering an explosion in the laboratory. Outside the laboratory, facility guards are opening the door when the sprinkler system activates and the trigger scent begins to shower the whole facility. When the doors are opened, X-23 lunges towards the facility guards and begins to kill everyone in a murderous frenzy. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-harkin/29-65447/\">Prof Harkin</a> is locked inside of office, calling for Kimura's help. X-23 barges in and was about to kill him but she was knock out by Kimura. She then kills the professor and was about to kill X-23 but Agent Morales threw a Molotov cocktail to her, setting her on fire. Morales then help X-23 to her feet and escapes, but not before placing other Molotov cocktail in all of the flammable and explosive parts of the Facility. Agent Morales and X-23 escapes the destroyed Facility, after which Kimura warned X-23 that she will kill everyone that she loved. It was then that the Stepford Cuckoos found X-23 where Domino and Wolverine pick her up with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Magik</a> teleporting them out.</p><h3>Utopia</h3><p>X-Force was deployed as a rescue team to save other mutants that will be subjected to <a href=\"/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a>'s experiments. Later, they arrived as reinforcements during the conflict between the original X-Men, the <a>Dark X-Men</a> and the <a>Dark Avengers</a>. With Archangel taking down <a>Hawkeye</a>, and Wolverine defeating <a>Weapon Omega</a>, both of <a>Osborn</a>'s team fall back.

X-23 then picks up a scent of the dead, and so does Wolverine. As this was going on, they were shot down by a lightning bolt and landed near <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopia/34-56536/\">Utopia</a>. It was there that Warpath detected multiple dead mutants closing on to them with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pyro/29-3554/\">Pyro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/berzerker/29-30570/\">Berserker</a>, the one that shot them down, welcoming them to their own death. As these events are going on, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> begins to hear voices in her mind. She thinks that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/void/29-11585/\">Void</a> is taking over until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarot/29-2140/\">Tarot</a> together with her deceased team, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a>, told her that she is mistaken.</p><p>They begin to attack Emma and and blame her for their death until she was saved by Cyclops, Domino and Wolverine. As every member of X-Men are all fighting Selene's resurrected minions, Selene orders the Hellions to retrieve Cypher who lost contact with Eli Bard. As the Hellions leaves the X-Men, they were replaced by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\">Banshee</a>, who immediately attacked his former comrades. Vanisher quickly teleports the X-Men to safety, where they received information that Selene is behind the recent resurrections and also witness the massive surge of life coming out of the island of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>. As Cyclops formulate a plan for a counterattack, the X-Men find themselves face to face against Selene's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inner-circle/65-57190/\">Inner Circle</a>. As the Inner Circle dominate over their battle against the X-Men and the X-Force, Eli Bard goes after Warpath, demanding the spirit blade that he got from the Demon Bear. Trusting Eli Bard's word that the attacks on Utopia will stop if he gives up the blade, he gives it, but in return the Inner Circle kidnaps him and took him to Necrosha.</p><p>Meanwhile, Hrimhari takes Wolfsbane to Elixir to have her healed only to find him unconscious <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-nemesis/29-29259/\">Doctor Nemesis</a> pointing a gun at him but he was stopped by X-23. As Doctor Nemesis assess Wolfsbane's condition, he finds out that she is pregnant, and the baby is killing her. Hrimhari runs off to the roof and with a long howl, he summons <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hela/29-4342/\">Hela</a>, the god of death. They both teleport back to Wolfsbane and stops time there. Hrimhari then asks Hela to save both Wolfsbane and their love child but Hela will only save one of them in exchange for his soul. As Hela looses her patience for the Wolf Prince, Hrimhari chose to save Elixir instead, whom he knows is the only one who can save both Wolfsbane and his baby. As soon as Hela cures Elixir, he wakes up disoriented with Hrimhari telling Elixir to give his love to Rahne and he promised he will come back in anyway possible before disappearing.</p><p>As Utopia lies in ruin, Wolverine radios the Cuckoos to find <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wither/29-40511/\">Wither</a> and they tell him that he and the Inner Circle have left the island and took with them Warpath. Cyclops then tells Wolverine that X-Men will defend Utopia from any other attack from Selene's forces while the X-Force will go to Necrosha, find Warpath and stop Selene. Emma changes Cyclops' orders and tells Logan that they must kill Selene. X-Force teleported just outside of Selene's castle, and as the rest of X-Force goes prepares to attack, Vanisher leaves them. Meanwhile, Warpath is being tortured his brother, Thunderbird and Blink, Vanisher suddenly teleports in and saved Warpath but not before losing his arm. As the ritual to turn Selene into a god, a wave of energy destroy every living thing in Necrosha.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1167531\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1167531-prv4760_pg8_super.jpg\" title=\"Impersonating the dead\"><img id=\"1167531\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1167531-prv4760_pg8_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Impersonating the dead\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Impersonating the dead</div></div></div></div><p>When the energy wave was about to hit X-Force, Vanisher teleports the whole team to safety.

The X-Force then teleported inside Selene's castle and each member going after each member of Selene's Inner Circle. Wolverine and X-23 dismembers Senyaka, Archangel wounds Blink, Wolfsbane cuts Mortis' throat, Elixir kills Wither and Warpath snaps Thunderbird's neck. While Blink and Mortis escape, X-Force are confronted by a giant Selene and started to attack them until Warpath stabs her by her own demon blade in chest causing her to explode.</p><p>Two days later, Cyclops debrief Wolverine on the status of X-Force and he told him that Warpath, Elixir, Wolfsbane, and X-23 are no longer on the team. Cyclops then told Wolverine that they may still need the team now more than ever.</p><h3>Code Red</h3><p>When Domino found out the identity of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-hulk/29-56974/\">Red Hulk</a>, he formed a team called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/code-red/65-56954/\">Code Red</a> to eliminate her.

As Wolverine is interrogating one of the league member who is not telling them anything, X-23 kills another member to threaten him, but the league member told them that they are just given instructions inside their brain. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> and Nightcrawler then asked Angel, Wolverine and X-23 what they were hiding and they told the X-Men of the existence of the X-Force and Cyclops involvement, which Cyclops confirmed when asked by Nightcrawler.</p><p>As Bastions attack become more dangerous he decides to isolate the X-Men resulting in the deaths of their teleporters Nightcrawler and Vanisher. Soon his plans are revealed and he traps all of San Francisco in powerful force field. In the center of the bubble is a smaller one connecting them to a future timeline. Bastion begins to send <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nimrod/29-13314/\">Nimrod</a> Sentinels through the bubble and although the X-Men fight them off they learn that an even larger force waits on the other end.

However this is revealed as a suicide mission as Cable on had enough power left for one trip. They manage to shut down the Master Mold in the future from sending the Nimrods in to the present timeline but they find out that they can't go through the time tunnel because only inorganic life can go through.

Shortly after the meeting between Wolverine and Cyclops, Wolverine returned to X-Force headquarters on Alcatraz Island to inform his new rogue team of X-Men that they cannot let anyone know they formed a new X-Force team. The new rogue X-Force team is lead by Wolverine and consists of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Archangel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantomex/29-4281/\">Fantomex</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> and operates outside of X-Men and without the knowledge of Cyclops or any other member of the X-Men.

Deadpool finds out that a secret society is trying to resurrect Apocalypse, when suddenly a giant Devil statue attacks him. Meanwhile, Psylocke dreams of Archangel's persona threatening her. Betsy wakes up by Warren's side and explains that if she were to remove \"Archangel\" permanently, it would fracture Warren's mind. Warren says he needs Betsy to keep Archangel from going too far, so he can use it do to some good in X-Force. Psylocke and Angel then join Wolverine and Fantomex, and they all head to the place Deadpool found the <a href=\"/clan-akkaba/65-52719/\">Clan Akkaba</a>. When they enter the Clan's temple, Wolverine attacks another giant statue; however he becomes possessed by it. The same happens to Psylocke when she uses her powers on it. Fantomex misdirects the statue's feelings and destroys it, setting Psylocke free. Betsy then frees Wolverine, using her psy-knife. The team find Deadpool, and Warrens explains that Clan Akkaba has found a way to resurrect Apocalypse and that his horsemen have been awoken. They need to kill <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>. Somewhere else, Clan Akkaba is raising a young boy, the new, re-born Apocalypse.</p><p>At <a href=\"/cavern-x/34-57109/\">Cavern X</a>, Wolverine, Psylocke, Fantomex and Deapool all train in the new Danger Room in a scenario where Apocalypse controls Archangel and Psylocke has to kill him. Warren finds out about it and gets upset. Meanwhile, At the Akkaba Stronghold Ship, kid Apocalypse is being tutored. He's taught that he's a savior to his people and only the stronger shall survive. He aims to bring about the Age of Apocalypse. Back at Cavern X, Warren and Logan talk about what happened earlier and come to an understanding, and Fantomex tracks the Akkaba ship to the <a href=\"/the-moon/34-42072/\">Moon</a>. Before going to the Moon, Betsy tells Warren she's there not only to keep Archangel in check, but also because being with him was the last time she felt human, so they make up. Once they arrive on the moon, X-Force is received by the Final Horsemen: <a href=\"/war/29-70794/\">War</a>, the Minotaur, <a href=\"/famine/29-74591/\">Famine,</a> an Army drummer, <a href=\"/death/29-74590/\">Death</a>, a Geisha and <a href=\"/pestilence/29-74592/\">Pestilence,</a> a sorcerer riding a a magic carpet.

Kid Apocalypse doesn't really want to give the death order, not wanting to kill anyone, showing he is still just a child, so <a href=\"/ozymandias/29-14183/\">Ozymandias</a> gives the order for him. Luckily for X-Force, that delay gives the team the opportunity to attack. Betsy looks in the minds of the Horsemen, finding out their names, histories and powers. She tells Wolverine that Death's power comes from metal, using his rings to inflict disease on the team. Wolverine then takes on Death, leaving Fantomex and Psylocke to take on the others. Betsy turns off Fantomex's ears, so he can be safe from Famine's bio-sonic consumption. She also disconnects his peripheral and nociceptor nerves in order to turn off his pain. War then knocks out Betsy with a punch to the head and Pestilence takes on Fantomex, he uses his powers of misdirection to make her believe he is her father, then swiftly knocks her out, breaking her jaw in the process. He then begins to use his powers of misdirection to swap Wolverine with Pestilence, infecting her with many diseases, while Fantomex gets the near dead Wolverine away from the fight. Elsewhere Deadpool tries to help Archangel, who was severely affected by Famine's powers. Meanwhile War, who had taken Psylocke and returned with her to his room. There she heals and when she wakes, War tells her he is in love with her. After Fantomex's misdirection wears off, the rest of the Horsemen retreat to their base and prepare to lift-off. Psylocke, who made it inside, flirts with War, and gets close enough to him to drive her psychic knife into his skull, incapacitating him. The ship is about to take off, and Wolverine, Fantomex, Deadpool and Archangel are left behind. With the ship about to take off, Apocalypse is playing with figurines, when the door opens and a sword welding Psylocke approaches the frightened Kid Apocalypse.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1638716\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1638716-to_kill_apocalypse_super.jpg\" title=\"Fantomex kills Apocalypse\"><img id=\"1638716\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1638716-to_kill_apocalypse_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Fantomex kills Apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fantomex kills Apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>Fantomex and Wolverine dispose of the Horsemen as EVA transports them to a planet far away.

Psylocke makes her way to the inner chambers of the child Apocalypse and finds it harder to accomplish her task than ever dreamed of. Betsy protects the child, pretty much stating that she will kill anyone that attempts to harm the boy. Archangel then goes berserk; which forces Betsy to beat him down. X-Force then comes to an agreement that the child can be saved... that's when X-Force members are left shocked looking back at Fantomex who has shot the boy dead with a bullet to the head.

X-Force decides to learn the details of their plot and then kill all of them. Psylocke is especially happy as she will finally make the Reavers pay for what they did to her and the X-Men years ago. The Reavers are blackmailing Gateway to open a portal to Utopia, otherwise they'll kill his family/tribe. X-Force then confronts the Reavers in Australia. Lady Deathstrike plans on making Wolverine suffer; she doesn't want him to die. While Logan and Deathstrike fight, one of the Reavers blows up in front of Fantomex and Deadpool. Psylocke and Archangel are left against the rest of them. Some of the Reavers are seen using Gateway's portal to Utopia, and Psylocke goes after them alone. Pixie is on security duty and spots intruders on the radar on Utopia. Cyclops and Magneto find out they're Reavers, but by the time they find them they're all dead. Psylocke had used her telepathy and stealth to get to the Reavers before the X-Men do and killed them. She leaves their corpses and leaves Utopia unnoticed. Back in the Outback, Wolverine beats Deathstrike and she uploads herself through a computer and escapes. We see Wolverine tell Psylocke she doesn't look so happy about the revenge she just had...</p><h3>Deathlok Nation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1514528\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1514528-12_uxforce005_cov_col_super.jpg\" title=\"The Deathloks attack Fantomex\"><img id=\"1514528\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1514528-12_uxforce005_cov_col_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Deathloks attack Fantomex\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Deathloks attack Fantomex</div></div></div></div><p>Deadpool calls an X-Force meeting without Fantomex. He discussing not feeling right about killing kid Apocalypse and that he didn't sign up to murder kids. Logan disagrees and tells Wade he knew exactly what he signed up for. Deadpool leaves and Logan tells Warren to remove Wade from the team. Warren tells Logan that Deadpool has worked for him for a year and he hasn't cashed any of the checks he paid him. Hinting that Wade just might be there because he wants to be. Fantomex visits his mother at home. She tells him he has a good conscience and that she feels she had a part in making sure he grew up with good ethic in the small amount of time she had to raise him. The two are ambushed by heroes fused with deathlok tech. Spider-Man kills Fantomex's mother, he escapes with EVA, but soon crashes as he makes his way out of his ship he sees <a href=\"/deathlok/29-7258/\">Deathlok</a> standing before him.</p><p>Deathlok senses other Deathlok units from another possible future and believes that they are up to no good. The alternate Deathlok units are comprised of superheroes who in the future are hunted, killed, and then reanimated as super-cop Deathlok units, which the government sanctions. The alternate Deathloks have been sent back in time to protect their possible future by obtaining a weapon known as the World. Apparently, after Fantomex killed the child Apocalypse, it caused a disturbance in the time stream sending Deathloks and their controller into phone-booth time machines to fix the glitch. Meanwhile, Psylocke tells <a href=\"/captain-britain/29-7477/\">Brian Braddock</a> that she aided in the murder of a child. Brian gets angry, but tells her that he can't absolve or condone her, and that he will always love her. His image then disappears, and Warren asks Betsy what she was doing alone in the Danger Room, to which she replies that she was talking to herself. Fantomex and Deathlok manage to escape the other Deathloks with the aid of X-Force. Fantomex then decides that the only way to stop this is by killing the \"Father\". He then expands the World, X-Force is going in to kill Father and the Future.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1776225\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1776225-hj_super.png\" title=\"Apocalypse alive\"><img id=\"1776225\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1776225-hj_medium.png\" alt=\"Apocalypse alive\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Apocalypse alive</div></div></div></div><p>X-Force and Deathlok enter The World. Deathlok explains that Deathloks perpetually travel in time to protect the events that ensure a future where all super beings are controlled, and that if they fail to kill Father, this will be almost impossible to stop. X-Force then decide to split up. Fantomex and Deadpool end up arguing with each other over their behavior and attitude. Meanwhile, Logan and Deathlok happen to face Deathlok-Wolverine. Elsewhere, Psylocke argues with Angel. He seems to think of her \"mothering\" him too much, whereas Betsy is concerned because he hasn't come to her for their psychic exercises. Both are chased by Deathlocks versions of Psylocke/Warren. They fly at high speeds and Psylocke turns around throwing her katana which stabs Deathlok-Psylocke in the head and kills her. Psylocke then tells Warren to go back for her sword. He tells her she has more of those, however she insists that she wants that one. Meanwhile, Deadpool finds the Father who uses his powers on Wade to make him love him like a father, whilst watching Fantomex being beaten by the Deathloks, trying to desperately protect what's hidden in his laboratory. Deadpool breaks free of the control and kills the Father by chopping off his head, making the Deathloks cease to exist. The team re-gather, with Wade triumphantly presenting Father's head and Fantomex tells them their mission is over. However, it is revealed that in the laboratory Fantomex brought baby Apocalypse to the World and has him incubating in a tube back in the Weapon X program.

Meanwhile at Cavern-X, Betsy and Warren are having another psychic therapy, where Betsy ends up trapping the \"Archangel\" persona in one of Warren's first moments of rage. X-Force then decides to head to the military base because they have lost contact with Deadpool. Psylocke tells the others there is a powerful telepath working in that base, and asks them to guard her while she's out to find who is it: she then sees <a href=\"/shadow-king/29-14889/\">The Shadow King</a> on the astral plane. The Shadow King finds a crack in Betsy's psy shields and starts filling her head with images of her brothers telling her how shocked they are that she's a killer and that their father would be disappointed. Shadow Kings manages to break Psylocke down, but ultimately she escapes. While all of that was happening in the Astral Plane, the Shadow King had taken control over Angel, Wolverine and Deadpool. Fantomex was left alone to protect Betsy's body by misdirecting them. The mind-controlled Archangel tries to launch the missiles at Utopia. Psylocke tries to stop him, but she gets locked out of the missiles launch room, where only Warren and one other mind-controlled employee were. The Shadow King finds the Archangel persona trapped inside Warren's mind, and ends up freeing him. Archangel takes full control of Warren, and cuts Shadow King's in half, to Betsy's surprise. Archangel then casts Betsy out of Warren's mind, telling her, she won't remember his freedom. Warren then snaps out of it, and kills the employee who was about to launch the missiles, even though the employee was also out of the mind control. Wolverine says he hadn't any other option, even unknown to them, he had another option...</p><h3>High Art</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1797668\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1797668-ghj_super.png\" title=\"Magneto's request\"><img id=\"1797668\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1797668-ghj_medium.png\" alt=\"Magneto's request\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Magneto's request</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> inquires with <a href=\"/doctor-nemesis/29-29259/\">Dr. Nemesis</a> about a request that was made by Magneto, to which he gets dismissed.

Meanwhile, X-Force returns from their last mission, stating that the Shadow King is due to return once again. They also console Angel about his actions in said mission. Upon arriving at Carvern X, X-Force meets Magneto who had defeated Deathlok. Warren asks him how he found about them, to which Magneto replies \"Remember to whom you are speaking\". Magneto gives them the information about a former Nazi he wants to be killed. Wolverine dismisses the rest of X-Force and decides to proceed with the mission by himself.

Archangel hears about this and leaves to go deal with it. Psylocke notices how much Archangel has changed and decides to tell Logan that Warren is becoming a problem.</p><p>Archangel then meets up with Harper and is about to kill him but Wolverine breaks in and the two fight. Archangel manages to fly away and is about to kill Harper but he struggles to do so since Warren knows it's wrong and is holding Archangel back. Warren is subdued by Psylocke and the team locks Warren up in Cavern X and erases Harper's memory. The team decides that there is only one person in the world who would know what is wrong with Warren. They break <a href=\"/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a> out of jail who tells them that since they killed Apocalypse, Archangel now is becoming what he was designed to be: The Heir of Apocalypse. The only way to cleanse Warren of Archangel is to use a \"Life Seed\" to eliminate the \"Death Seed\" that is inside of Warren. Unfortunately the only way to get the Life Seed would be to travel to his laboratory in his home dimension: The Age Of Apocalypse.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1842074\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55543/1842074-prv8598_pg5_super.jpg\" title=\"The Age Of Apocalypse\"><img id=\"1842074\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55543/1842074-prv8598_pg5_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Age Of Apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Age Of Apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>Using an inter-dimensional portal built by Dark Beast, the gang travels to <a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">The Age Of Apocalypse</a> universe and gets the life seed from Dark Beast's lab.

The Life Seed is destroyed by <a href=\"/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a>, while Dark Beast escapes through the portal back into the 616 universe. The portal closes, trapping X-Force in the Age of Apocalypse universe.

Although their kissing is interrupted by a Sentinel attack. Jean easily takes care of the Sentinel and the team gets together to discuss what's going on. Turns out that the Age of Apocalypse version of <a href=\"/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a> has found the celestial where Dark Beast found the Life Seed and has detected multiple Life Seeds within it. Fantomex suggests splitting into two teams, one will get the Life Seed from the celestial and the other will break the <a href=\"/gateway/29-4646/\">Gateway</a> of this universe out of the Akkaba Prison known as The Sky.</p><p>Fantomex meets up with Psylocke later and the two argue, Psylocke still mad at Fantomex for killing Apocalypse.

It's also revealed that AOA Iceman was a traitor and that he gave the Black Legion information. Gateway manages to teleport the gang to where AOA Wolverine is to save Jean.

They're in fact older than the Earth, and became the embodiments of death on Earth when it was first commencing to come alive. They come from a time long before good or evil, for that matter, right or wrong. They're hellstorms, nothing more or less--living breathing tornadoes of mystical energy consuming everything in their path without restraint or remorse. They were trapped a thousand years ago in their own dimension by the <span class=\"yui-non\">Northern Gods</span> but the magics holding them weakened. The Great Beasts live in a realm that was once not unlike Earth, though in a universe outside our own. After a million years passed, the Beasts rose to power there. They pillaged and corrupted their world, then set forth for greener pastures. Three times they attacked Earth, the planet nearest on the mystic continuum, and three times they were driven back. The last time, they were sealed behind a barrier designed to keep them forever in the <span class=\"yui-non\">Realm of the Beasts</span>. The battle cost the victors as much as the vanquished. The land-beast <span class=\"yui-non\">Tundra</span>, who was ever at war with the beast of the snow, <span class=\"yui-non\">Kolomaq</span>, created a magical vortex that spun the energies of the barrier back onto their creators.

Never did he think that he would have to deal with death while fighting for his dream, especially the death of his own students. Reeling from the recent deaths of two of his students, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Phoenix</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a> (John Proudstar), who lost their lives in missions as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, Charles Xavier would be very grief-stricken and anguished. Having no time to grieve, Professor X and his X-Men would be attacked by the parasitic alien race known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a>. Professor X would survive, but believing the X-Men to be dead, he had all but given up on the idea of ever teaching again. The efforts of his one-time lover and current best friend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a>, persuaded him to take on two of her charges. Both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Xi\u2019an Coy Mahn (Karma)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Rahne Sinclair (Wolfsbane)</a> would be Xavier\u2019s new students and would attend the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a>. Shortly after the two girls settled in, Xavier received a letter from one of his longtime friends, Black Eagle. It stated that he had just been given custody of his granddaughter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Danielle Moonstar (Psyche)</a>, and that she was a mutant.</p><p>The letter asked if Xavier would be willing to take her as a student and teach her how to use her burgeoning mutant powers. Xavier set off to meet her immediately, bringing along his two current students with him. When the trio arrived, they found that his old friend, Black Eagle, had been murdered at the hands of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">Donald Pierce</a>, who was a long-standing villain of the X-Men. He held the title of White Bishop in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>\u2019s Inner Circle. Upon further investigation, they ran into Black Eagle\u2019s granddaughter, Danielle, who was alive and hiding. After a brief talk, Dani agreed to go with Professor X and his two other charges. She wished to track down her grandfather\u2019s killer and make him pay for what he had done.</p><p>Soon, they found yet another individual who was attacked by Pierce: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">Roberto da Costa (Sunspot)</a>, a youthful mutant. He had been out with his girlfriend, Juliana Sandoval; they were both attacked by Pierce and his mercenary squad. Sunspot was able to survive the attack thanks to his mutant powers, but his girlfriend was not so lucky. Pierce killed her on the spot while Sunspot watched, helpless. Sunspot also joined the team of young mutants led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>. They were able to track down Pierce's headquarters, and decided to attack it directly as a group. Once they arrived, they encounter Pierce's mercenary squad and made short work of them. Amongst the squad was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Samuel Guthrie (Cannonball)</a>, a mutant forced by Pierce to attack Xavier and his charges. Pierce commanded Cannonball to kill Xavier, but he refused and teamed up with Xavier\u2019s growing force. Together, they managed to defeat all the mercenaries. Xavier battled Pierce alone and defeated him with the use of his vaunted mental powers. The students would come together through unlikely events, and would stay together under the teaching of Professor Charles Xavier.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The success of the X-Men in the 1980s convinced Marvel Comics to publish the first spin-off to be inspired by the X-Men. Popular X-Men writer, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a>, and successful artist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-mcleod/26-4322/\">Bob McLeod</a>, created the New Mutants as well as the original, five students that comprised the team. Claremont and McLeod were the creative team for the first appearance of the New Mutants in Marvel Graphic Novel #4 in 1982. Claremont, McLeod and inker, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mike-gustovich/26-20017/\">Mike Gustovich</a>, were the creative team for the first issue of the on-going New Mutants series in 1983.</p><h2><b>Team Evolution</b></h2><p>The five young mutants stayed with Xavier and became students at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a>. Though he did not want to teach anymore, out of fear of losing more students, he quickly changed his mind. Though unknown to all, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> only allowed the new team to form at the behest of the alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a>. Professor X was present at the battle with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, during which they apparently died. No one ever questioned how or why he lived. In truth, the Brood had laid an egg inside Professor X. Once inside, the egg eventually takes over the body of its victim, slowly transforming him into one of the Brood. Now almost fully under the control of the Brood, Professor X willingly allowed the students to stay so that they could also become host to even more Brood eggs. However, the X-Men lived and made a timely arrival, curing Professor X before it was too late, saving their mentor and the students who would become the New Mutants.</p><p>Like the X-Men, the New Mutants all had largely different backgrounds, social statuses and ethnicity. The original team consisted of:</p><h3><b>Cannonball (Samuel Guthrie)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"231095\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2951/231095-160999-cannonball_super.gif\" title=\"Cannonball\"><img id=\"231095\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2951/231095-160999-cannonball_medium.gif\" alt=\"Cannonball\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cannonball</div></div></div></div><p>From Kentucky, Cannonball came from meek beginnings and a huge family supported by only his mother, as his father passed away in a coal-mining accident. Cannonball like his codename, has the ability to propel himself the air like a human cannonball, all the while creating an impenetrable force field around himself making him invulnerable while in flight. He would share leadership of the New Mutants with his teammate Psyche.</p><h3><b>Psyche (Danielle Moonstar)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"290659\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/290659-89532-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Psyche\"><img id=\"290659\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/290659-89532-moonstar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Psyche\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Psyche</div></div></div></div><p>Danielle was a proud Native American with the blood of the Cherokee coursing through her blood. Strong willed and determined she would use her mental based powers to manifest images of others greatest desires and/or fears to stop her foes in their tracks. Due to her level headed nature and natural instincts she would share the role as team leader of the New Mutants with Cannonball.</p><h3><b>Karma (Xi\u2019an Coy Mahn)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"839323\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/839323-285174_68650_karma_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Karma\"><img id=\"839323\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/839323-285174_68650_karma_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Karma\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Karma</div></div></div></div><p>Xi\u2019an was the only adult member of the New Mutants.

Amidst her travels she would lose both of her parents leaving her the sole guardian and protector of the younger siblings. Seeking peace and a safe place for her brother and sister are her main concern. And she would be ready and willing to use her mutant power to mentally possess another individual to the fullest extent to ensure she achieves her goal.</p><h3><b>Wolfsbane (Rahne Sinclair)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"679615\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/679615-wolfsbane_costume1_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolfsbane\"><img id=\"679615\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/679615-wolfsbane_costume1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolfsbane\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolfsbane</div></div></div></div><p>The red-headed Scottish girl named Rahne was orphaned at birth leaving her alone until Reverend Craig stepped in. She was raised by Reverend Craig and was given a regular dose of guilt and shame on a daily basis. When Rahne's mutant powers first emerged allowing her to transform into a red furred werewolf, the Reverend thought she was possessed by the Devil. He attempted to do an exorcism but she was saved by Moira MacTaggert which eventually led her to Professor X and the New Mutants.</p><h3><b>Sunspot (Roberto da Costa)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"84847\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/84847-174079-sunspot_super.jpg\" title=\"Sunspot\"><img id=\"84847\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/84847-174079-sunspot_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Sunspot\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sunspot</div></div></div></div><p>From Brazil, Roberto was born to a wealthy family and was a soccer star on the rise. During one of his games, his powers manifested themselves when he kicked a ball at another player, inadvertently injuring him. Shunned by everyone, he had no choice but to leave his home. He later lived at the Xavier Institute, where he learned to properly use his solar absorption powers and his increased strength responsibly.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The New Mutants Are Born</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"85611\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/85611-180131-magma_super.jpg\" title=\"Magma\"><img id=\"85611\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/85611-180131-magma_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Magma\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Magma</div></div></div></div><p>Together they formed the first junior X-Men team ever and were dubbed the New Mutants. Though they were a team they were not meant to ever see field duty. It was not Professor X\u2019s wishes to have them do battle. But fate has a way of doing what it chooses. Together they would live at the x-mansion and be trained and taught by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>. They would go through many battles from Demon Bears bent on killing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Psyche</a>, to Viper with her partner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-samurai/29-3174/\">Silver Samurai</a> to there rival teen mutant team the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a> and even to seemingly other worldly places like the hidden land of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova-roma/34-54217/\">Nova Roma</a>. While in Nova Roma, it would be where they would first encounter the vampiric, immortal, sorceress Selene (later the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/selene/29-2176/\">Black Queen</a> of the Hellfire Club\u2019s Inner Circle) who was attempting to drain the life of one of the of the Nova Romans by the name of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla (Magma)</a>. Through a random string of event the New Mutants would end up saving the life of Amara but defeating Selene. The New Mutants would find out that Amara, too, was a mutant as they were. She would be the first to be recruited in the group of New Mutants besides the charter members. Though they would gain a powerful new teammate they would also gain a new villain that would seek revenge on the New Mutants for their meddling. Once Magma was saved she would leave her home and move to the Xavier Institute and become a full-time member of the New Mutants.</p><p><b>Hellion</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"401427\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9345/401427-15436-hellions_super.jpg\" title=\"Hellions\"><img id=\"401427\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9345/401427-15436-hellions_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Hellions\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hellions</div></div></div></div><p>Amidst the training, gelling and strengthening of their team another team was being created by the sinister organization known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>. This would be created specifically to do battle with the New Mutants. They were called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a>. As the New Mutants were to be X-Men in training, the Hellions were to be future members of the Hellfire Club. While some, Wolfsbane and Catseye (New Mutants and Hellions respectfully), would kind kindred spirits in each other. A larger majority would find rivals, life long enemies and in some cases future lovers. The Hellions would do battle with the New Mutants numerous times in there time as teams.</p><h3>More Members Come &amp; Go</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"136750\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5029/136750-75353-warlock_super.jpg\" title=\"Warlock\"><img id=\"136750\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5029/136750-75353-warlock_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Warlock\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Warlock</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly after Magma joins the team, the New Mutants would have yet another recruit found in the younger sister of X-Men member Colossus by the name of Illyana Rasputin ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magik/29-8303/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magik</a>). With her mutant teleporting powers and the fact that she is the ruler and Sorceress Supreme of the dark dimension known as Limbo, she would lead the New Mutants into many new, different and darker missions. Many the likes of which the New Mutants had never seen and likely wish they never would have seen. Rounding off the team were the additions of the mutant mental linguist Douglas Ramsey (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Cypher</a>) and the Techno-Organic alien <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warlock/29-7223/\">Warlock</a>. After this time, the X-men returned home and the New Mutants could relax a bit more and take a break after so many months of intense battles. During this more relaxing time the New Mutants met with the son of Charles Xavier, David Haller, or <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion/29-13349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion</a>. A powerful mutant , but also a schizophrenic with witch the New Mutants had their hands full. Not soon after Professor Xavier had to leave the earth, he was injured badly and was taken into outer space for healing by his soul-mate Lilandra. Not wishing to leave the New Mutants without anyone to care for them, Xavier would turn to his long time friend and sometimes enemy Magneto to fill in for him.</p><p>Thus, it came to pass that Magneto became Headmaster of the Xavier Institute and caretaker of the New Mutants. This decision didn\u2019t sit well with anyone. Due to this past misdeeds and violent history with the X-Men the New Mutants as a whole initially didn't trust him. Slowly he did prove himself to some of the kids but it was clear the New Mutants wouldn't do Magneto's bidding without thinking it over for at least a second time. Not soon after this the New Mutants encountered the Beyonder, a being powerful enough to lay waste to the whole universe. The mutants tried stopping him, but this resulted into the seeming deaths of all the team-members. However, the Beyonder soon thought it to be foolish and brought them back to live. Though alive, it left the New Mutants traumatized and Magneto questioning himself whether or not he was the right person to teach the young mutants. During their time with Magneto the team would see their long time teammate Magma leave their team and join their rivals the Hellions.</p><h3>Fall of the Mutants</h3><p>At a certain point the New Mutants would encounter an Ani-Mate mutant known by the name of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bird-brain/29-30056/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bird Brain</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ani-mates/65-57199/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ani-Mates</a> where genetically engineered animals giving human abilities by their creator the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ani-mator/29-30075/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ani-Mator</a>. The New Mutants befriended Bird-Brain and even have him join the team for a short while. While assisting their new member on his home-island (witch was actually a prison for all the mutated animals) the New Mutants got into a heated battle with the Ani-Mator which ended with the death of one of the New Mutants. During the battle Ani-Mator was going to shoot Wolfsbane but Cypher jumped in front of her, trying to rescue her but getting hit by the bullets himself as a result.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"157003\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3016/157003-130248-cypher_super.JPG\" title=\"Cypher\"><img id=\"157003\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3016/157003-130248-cypher_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Cypher\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cypher</div></div></div></div><p>Doug died a few minutes later. Filled with rage over the death of Cypher, Magik teleported the Ani-mator and his soldiers to Limbo. Letting her demons do to them whatever they wanted. After the battle Bird Brain made clear he wanted to stay with his other mutate friends on their home-island, witch was no longer a prison to them. So the team lost another member of themselves at the same day. Reeling from the death of their friend and teammate and lose of Magma and Bird-Brain, the New Mutants would follow up by denouncing Magneto\u2019s position and his control over them. This was mainly because the New Mutants had found out that Magneto was not only working on the side of Xavier now, but he was also a member of the Hellfire Club\u2019s Inner Circle as their White King. An organization bend on world-domination through political and financial means, as well as one of the X-Men's most feared enemy's. Although Magneto only did this to help the New Mutants, having more power</p><p>meant to protect the mutants, the New Mutant's didn't (want to) understand his point of view. The revealing of this information would only create more animosity on the side of the New Mutants against their new Headmaster. The New Mutants would later be joined by the beautiful alien known by the name of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gosamyr/29-29330/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gosamyr</a>. As quickly as she joined the team, she would depart. The events that followed would put the New Mutants through a tailspin that would be an impossible job of recovery.</p><h3>Inferno</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"832759\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/832759-gonzales_magik2_super.jpg\" title=\"Magik\"><img id=\"832759\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/832759-gonzales_magik2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Magik\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Magik</div></div></div></div><p>The New Mutants would next go through the events better known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inferno/39-41408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inferno</a> and before that day would end they would lose yet another teammate; this time it was Illyana Rasputin (Magik). The Inferno was a demon invasion over New York City, the result of a trick played by Magik's second in Limbo; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sym/29-10291/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'ym</a>. Magik was the only person with enough power to close the demon gate from Limbo to Earth that made the invasion possible. But she could only achieve this by letting her darker side take full control over her. After the gate was closed the seemingly lifeless form of the Dark Child (as she was known by then) lay before her brothers feed. But nothing was further from the truth. Illyana was found inside the hull of the Dark Child. She was reduced to her child-hood and was 7 years old again. The same age she had when she was first kidnapped into Limbo all those many years ago. This was probably the result of a time-travel warp the New Mutants took during the Inferno in which the New Mutants saved the 7 year old Illyana right after she was taken to Limbo for the first time. Back to her child-state, Illyana was too young to have her mutant powers yet and lost every memory (or the ability to speak English) she had since she joined the New Mutants.</p><p>After Inferno the New Mutants and Illyana returned to the Xavier Institute, but where horrified when they saw it laying in ruins (The mansion was destroyed by Mr. Sinister during the Inferno crossover). In the ruins of their mansion they met their headmaster Magneto, alongside his new companions of the Hellfire Club. While Magneto tried to calm the kids down, they where furious with him for his absence during the Inferno and his collaborating with enemies of the X-men. They even attempted to battle him at the ruins of the school but fail short of their goal as they would be overpowered by his magnetic might. Beaten, the New Mutants went their own way, clearly letting Magneto know that they didn't want anything to do with him anymore. After this the New Mutants went to Russia to bring Illyana back to her parents, since it was too dangerous for a 7 year old child to stay with them. There they said goodbye to a good friend.</p><h3>Enter the X-Terminators</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"687909\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/687909-skids13_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Terminators\"><img id=\"687909\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/687909-skids13_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Terminators\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Terminators</div></div></div></div><p>Amidst the constant fighting that that the New Mutants were involved in during the Inferno, luck would soon fall upon them. They would find allies, in yet another group of mutant youths using the name the X-Terminators. When the dust settled and the Inferno was over the X-Terminators would disband and nearly all of their members would join the New Mutants including: Julio Rictor (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rictor/29-10988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rictor</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rusty-collins/29-13376/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rusty Collins</a> (Firefists), Tabitha Smith (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/boom-boom/29-2159/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boom Boom</a>) &amp; Sally Blevins (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skids/29-3194/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skids</a>). Though these four were granted membership into the New Mutants, they were never actual students at the Xavier Institute and were never taught under Professor X or his X-Men.</p><h3>The New Mutants no more</h3><p>Numerous events would follow in witch many of the core members of the team would leave. Mirage's powers became greater and greater, and during an adventure in</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"118629\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/118629-85504-new-mutants_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"118629\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/118629-85504-new-mutants_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Asgard, she chose to stay there, serving as a Valkyrie for the Norse Gods (including Thor). But the arrival of the future warrior known as Cable would change the New Mutants the most. Aimless without a leader the New Mutants would encounter Cable and quickly take him on as a mentor. As a warrior who had seen the dark future ahead, Cable told the New Mutants the only way to stop that future from happening was to transform their team into a 'strike-force' and take the initiative themselves. During the transformation of the team another casualty arose. Long time team-member Warlock seemingly died during the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-tinction-agenda/39-42177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Tinction Agenda</a>. Wolfsbane was also harmed in a bad way; seeing Warlock die in front of her and being turned into a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genoshian</a> slave made her stay in Genosha with teammate Rictor and X-man <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a>. She soon became part of the second incarnation of X-factor. During this time the only original members of the New Mutants who remained where Cannonball and Sunspot. Although the latter would return home after he heard his father died of a seeming heart-attack. Because Skids, Rusty and Rictor had also gone away that only left Cannonball and one of the newer recruits Boom-Boom part of the team. Soon though they would be joined by new and more aggressive mutants giving the team a more savage attitude then ever before. These new members would be:</p><h3><b>Domino (Neena Thurman)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1075314\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075314-87798_19769_domino_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Domino\"><img id=\"1075314\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075314-87798_19769_domino_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Domino\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Domino</div></div></div></div><p>Long time friend and sometimes lover of Cable. Able to have events and occurrences fall in place for her all the time. Domino joined the New Mutants when she heard Cable was leading them, whom she hadn't seen in years. It would later be revealed later that the Domino who joined the team was actually a double agent with morphing abilities named Copycat. The real Domino was captured while Copycat infiltrated the New Mutants. Copycat stayed with the team and even fought the good fight with them until the truth about her came out and the real Domino was freed from her captors. She then left, and the real Domino took in her place with the team, that by then would be known as X-force.</p><h3><b>Shatterstar (Benjamin Russell)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1075328\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075328-76774_130415_shatterstar_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Shatterstar\"><img id=\"1075328\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075328-76774_130415_shatterstar_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Shatterstar\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shatterstar</div></div></div></div><p>A refugee from the world known as Mojo-World, Shatterstar left his home-dimension after hearing rumors about a legendary fighter and strategist who was on earth to prevent an apocalyptic future, namely Cable. He and the New Mutants first met Shatterstar when he teleported into their training room, the Danger Room (Although the X-mansion had been destroyed during the Inferno, the lower levels, including the Danger Room, remained intact). Shatterstar started fighting the automatic training-programs until he was stopped by Cable. After that he swore allegiance to Cable and his new team, thus becoming one of the last members of the New Mutants before they became X-force.</p><h3><b>Feral (Maria Callasantos)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1075333\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075333-149583_124455_feral_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Feral\"><img id=\"1075333\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075333-149583_124455_feral_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Feral\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Feral</div></div></div></div><p>Their is not much known about the mutant named Feral. She is a Morlock who escaped the massacre that the Marauders inflicted upon her community. Feral came to the New Mutants much by accident, helping defeat a common foe. For most of her time on the team, she would remain a mystery to her other team members. They would often see her as more of a lose cannon then a trusted ally. She would come and go whenever she liked and she did not only cut enemies with her razor sharp claws, but also her teammates when something happened that she didn't like or approved of, thus honoring her code-name; Feral.</p><h3><b>Warpath (James Proudstar)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1075335\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075335-460579_warpath_01_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Warpath\"><img id=\"1075335\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1075335-460579_warpath_01_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Warpath\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Warpath</div></div></div></div><p>A mutant with a long history with the New Mutants. James was once a member of the Hellions, the great rivals of the New Mutants. After James left the Hellions, he returned to the reservoir where his friends and family lived. Coming there, the place was burned to the ground, and his family was missing. The only evidence left was a mask of a soldier of the Hellfire Club, the same organization that started the Hellions team. Filled with grief and wanting revenge on the people who hurt his family, James took on the name of Warpath and joined the New Mutants, just before it became X-force.</p><p>With the new members and a new mentor in Cable, the New Mutants would take on a radical change in philosophy and tactics. No more would they take the passive approach of Professor X. They would be more army like becoming soldiers, willing to do battle for what they believed in. As a result, the New Mutants would be no more. Under Cable's lead the team would segue from that of the New Mutants and officially change their name to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Force</a>.</p><h3>New Mutants: Truth or Dare</h3><p>This would be one of the few and only reunions of the original New Mutants. This story follows the current versions of the New Mutants, grown up, meeting their younger counterparts in the present. They would be brought to the future by Magik on a dare. The chance meeting of the New Mutant teams would finally explain how Illyana contracted the mutant killing Legacy Virus, which would eventually kill her, at the hands of her oldest brother Mikhail Rasputin.</p><h3>The New Mutants Squad</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"365111\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18265/365111-95649-new-mutants_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"365111\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18265/365111-95649-new-mutants_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>More than 10 years after the original New Mutants had both come and gone, Professor Xavier made the decision to go public with his school (in reality this was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a>, but Charles decided to keep the school running for the new generations of mutants). This resulted in a huge increase in the number of students who enrolled and attended the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a>. He had the current X-Men become teachers/staff and invited several of his former pupils and X-Men (including the ex-New Mutants) to return to the school as teachers and advisers to the hundreds of additional students.</p><p>The legacy of the New Mutants, would be reborn with some of the original members returning to become advisers for the students at Xavier's Institute including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Moonstar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a> and (later) <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>. Due to massive amount of students enrolled at the academy, the squad system was put in place. This broke down the students into teams (average size was six members, but could be greater or fewer) with an adviser to tailor their teaching and training styles specific to the squad. Each squad had their own student-leader in addition to adviser and they each had their own costumes and color schemes. The teams regularly competed and trained in a variety of methods.</p><p>Just as there was a team called the New Mutants many years in the past, so too would there be one now. The New Mutants Squad consisted of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a> (Josh Foley), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prodigy/29-40475/\">Prodigy</a> (David Alleyne), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/surge/29-40509/\">Surge</a> (Noriko Ashida), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wallflower/29-40535/\">Wallflower</a> (Laurie Collins), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sofia-mantega/29-40537/\">Wind Dancer</a> (Sofia Mantega), and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wither/29-40511/\">Wither</a> (Kevin Ford). The New Mutants squad would later be joined by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>'s younger brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Icarus</a> (Joshua \"Jay\" Guthrie) after Wither and he decided to exchange squads. The squad adviser would be none other than New Mutants alumna and charter member Danielle Moonstar.</p><h3>M-Day</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"840317\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/840317-84080_141074_xavier_institute_super.jpg\" title=\"After M-Day\"><img id=\"840317\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/840317-84080_141074_xavier_institute_medium.jpg\" alt=\"After M-Day\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">After M-Day</div></div></div></div><p>This squad would eventually disband around the time of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> and some of its members would move on and became members of the New X-Men (A junior up and coming team of X-Men). Though after M-Day, many New Mutants were de-powered such as Prodigy and Wind Dancer. Then tragedy would occur when the, mutant hating, Purifiers launched a rocket at a bus full of de-powered mutants that were leaving the school under the cover of night. All that were aboard the bus were killed devastating those who looked on helpless to stop it. Still reeling, only days later, more deaths would follow seeing Wallflower and Icarus, both previously of the New Mutants squad, meet their untimely deaths as well, at the hand of the Purifiers. This hurt all at the mansion, but it especially hurt there former teammates, who knew them the most.</p><h3>The Return of the original New Mutants</h3><p>Years after the team have disbanded, the original New Mutants all found themselves back at the X-men island home of Utopia. Bonded together after the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-infernus-saga/49-33840/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Infernus</a> and the return of the long diseased teammate Magic, Cannonball asked Cyclops if he could make his own team within the X-men to take on different threats around the world. With Cyclops' approval, Cannonball brought together his old team members; Moonstar, Magma, Karma, Sunspot and Magic. The team's first mission was to investigate the strange disappearance of a young mutant girl. Eventually this resulted in the discovery that the mutant son of Charles Xavier, Legion, was alive and well. The mutants just barley defeated his evil persona, and brought him back to Utopia after the fight was done and the girl was rescued.</p><h3>Necrosha</h3><p>Not soon after this, the techno-organic Warlock, old team-member of the New Mutants, returned from outer space, to see his old friends again. He first went to the X-mansion, but when he saw it laying in waste (after the events of the Messiah Complex) Warlock started searching for the mutants. He found them at the island of Utopia, just before disaster would strike with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/necrosha/39-55941/\">Necrosha</a>.</p><p>A long time adversary of the X-men and the New Mutants named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/selene/29-2176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selene</a> had brought back a large number of diseased mutants, including Doug Ramsey, long dead friend of the New Mutants. She used these dead mutants as slaves to fight against the X-men on their island. When Warlock first encountered Doug, he was ecstatic, but soon he was drained of all his energy by Doug, nearly killing Warlock in the process. The 'zombie' Doug sought and found the New Mutants, first almost beating Magma to death and then leading other dead mutants, including the dead advisories of the New Mutants, the Hellions into the headquarters of the X-men.</p><p>A large fight erupted. Thankfully a new X-force team managed to defeat Selene and putting all the dead mutants to their rest. Strangely, this did not happened to Doug, probably because Warlock was able to break the virus code through witch Doug was made a zombie to serve Selene. All his friends gathered around him, and Doug told them that 'they' were his language. After these events all the original New Mutants where back together again, except for Rahne. She stayed with X-force and later went back to the new X-factor agency.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1163544\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25705/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02_super.jpg\" title=\"New Mutants in Second Coming\"><img id=\"1163544\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25705/1163544-newmutants12cvr_02_medium.jpg\" alt=\"New Mutants in Second Coming\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">New Mutants in Second Coming</div></div></div></div><p>During the crossover of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/second-coming/39-55971/\">Second Coming</a>, Sam and his team are sent to fight against The Right and Cameron Hodge. During this Xi'an gets injured, resulting in her leg being amputated. Warlock also had to look past his vow of not killing another human life in order to save the New Mutants. Doug also found information on Bastion's towers. On another mission Illyana was sent to the X-Men, during this mission Illyana is sent to Limbo, but is saved in the Hellbound tie-in by a team lead by Sam, which featured no other New mutants. Later, after Hope is rescued (for the time being) Dani and Hope get in a fight after Dani confronts Cable about putting every other mutant in danger by bringing her here.</p><p>Later X-Force recruits Doug to go into the future and destroy the mastermind. Doug melds with the mastermind system and overtakes it. As a result all the Nimrods are deactivated. Those not injured also took part in the war against the Nimrod army in the area under the red dome.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-811 (Days of Future Past)</h3><p>In this despotic future time line, overrun by mutant killing Sentinels, the New Mutants still thrive and is still a team composed to mutant youths learning the proper use of their powers. Led by an older, war-torn Banshee, now wearing a patch and cybernetic limbs replacing ones lost. The New Mutants of this reality had a rough existence, never knowing when another Sentinel attack was going to happen. This New Mutants team consisted of:</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a> (Scrape):</b> the son of the Fantastic Fours Sue and Reed Richards. He was the field team leader.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-girl/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a>:</b> the telekinetic daughter of Jean Grey and Cyclops and girlfriend/future wife of Franklin.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Douglas Ramsey</a> (Magus):</b> the only member to stay on the team from the original New Mutants but very different from who he used to be. Due to his connection to Warlock he could get and be consumed by the Techno-Organic Virus. Being that he took that name \"Magus\" it can be assumed that he killed Warlock as well.</p><p><b>Blue:</b> the daughter of Nightcrawler and Amanda Sefton.</p><p>Blaze &amp; another unnamed member: no information was revealed of their lineage.</p><p>Though their fate as a team was unrevealed, it can be assumed that the New Mutants of this time line ended tragically as Franklin and Rachel are two of the last living mutants in America and in a mutant concentration camp and Banshee's gravestone are shown in front of the camp indicating his death at the hands of the Sentinels. It\u2019s likely that the other members too met the deaths in this apocalyptic future but nothing is certain.</p><p>A divergent reality similar to the Days of Future Past.</p><h3>New Mutants #49-50</h3><p>Most of the X-Men, if not all, and the New Mutants were killed by Sentinels in their initial attack. The New Mutants are now a trio consisting of three individuals: a now aged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, his lover <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lila-cheney/29-4556/\">Lila Cheney</a> and a very embittered and war torn <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Danielle Moonstar</a>. They devised a plan to gather the remaining mutants together and use Lila's intergalactic teleportation powers to safely leave Earth and head to another planet. It appears that they are successful in their attempts as they are shown teleporting away in one of the final panels.</p><h3>Earth-1081</h3><p>Homeworld of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morph/29-12547/\">Morph</a>, previously a member of the Exiles.</p><p>The New Mutants of this reality were/are very similar to the mainstream counterpart of Earth #616 with an exception to the members of the team. The team consisted of Cannonball, Sunspot, Moonstar, Wolfsbane and Morph.</p><h3>Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"716518\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14859/716518-440px_aot_super.jpg\" title=\"Academy of Tomorrow\"><img id=\"716518\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14859/716518-440px_aot_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Academy of Tomorrow\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Academy of Tomorrow</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, once a student of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a> but now disagreeing with his tactics, left to follow a dream of her own.

Initially she was going to form a group with the assistance of the United States government and the president. Once created she would dub the group the New Mutants. She wished to create a group of mutants that had no ties to Charles Xavier\u2019s vigilante police force that he created. She gathered a number of mutants together including:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a> (Field Leader), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Cypher</a> (the only non-mutant on the team), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">Sunspot</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> (Deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a> (Deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>.</p><p>In their first public appearance her team was attacked by Sentinels and would be saved by the X-Men whose tactics that she despised. Due to the attack she would severe ties with the government and renamed them the Academy of Tomorrow.</p><h3>Earth-? (Geshem)</h3><p>Here the New Mutants are represented as non-mutants living in a time very similar to the Dark Ages. Here, Rahne (Wolfsbane) is Princess Rain of Gesham. Members of her Royal household include: Tabby (Boom-Boom) her lady-in-waiting, her Prince consort Douglas Ramsey (Cypher) and her knights: Robert (Sunspot), Samuel (Cannonball) and Richard (Rictor).</p><p>None of the New Mutants in this reality have the powers of their original counterparts except for Rahne's knights Robert, Samuel and Richard. Though they are not mutants, they are granted their powers through the use of magical items.</p><h3>Earth-904</h3><p><i>What If the X-Men Stayed in Asgard?</i></p><p>An offer is made to the X-Men and New Mutants giving them the choice of whether to stay or leave Asgard. Though only a few X-Men accept and stay, all but three of the New Mutants remain in Asgard effectively putting an end to the group as a whole. Karma, Magma and Warlock would choose to leave returning to Earth and become fully fledged X-Men. Those that remain in Asgard dramatically change history there and most take on important roles while there.</p><p>Cannonball marries Eitri daughter of the dwarf king and soon becomes the Dwarf King when the, then, current king was killed in battle.</p><p>Danielle Moonstar battles and defeats Hela the Goddess of Death and takes her role and place becoming the new Goddess of Death, ruling over her domain of Hel.</p><p>Magik battles, easily defeats and replaces Enchantress and taking her name as well. She, too, becomes the liaison between Asgard and Hel as she is friends with Moonstar and does not fear her as others do.</p><p>Wolfsbane becomes the Queen of Wolves and has three cubs/kids continuing the royal line.</p><p>Sunspot is a warrior and dies in the final battle defending Storm by taking an energy blast meant for her. Once hit he was completely disintegrated.</p><p>Cypher becomes a scholar and translator of ancient texts of Asgard. Later he is appointed as Vizier to Storm when she becomes ruler of Asgard.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Animation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"792364\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39442/792364-717218_xmen_evolution_super_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Evolution\"><img id=\"792364\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39442/792364-717218_xmen_evolution_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Evolution\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Evolution</div></div></div></div><p><b>X-Men: Evolution</b></p><p>In the second season of the animated cartoon X-Men: Evolution, Professor X recruits a handful of new students at his Institute. Cannonball, Wolfsbane, Magma, Sunspot, Iceman, Jubilee, Berserker and Multiple Man are the new under class at Xavier's Institute and are called the New Mutants. Boom-Boom also became a member but became cold in the team as she was persuaded by her father to commit crime. She then temporarily became one of the Brotherhood. They undergo trainings together with the X-Men. At first, these New Mutants are not interested in schooling as they do not follow Jean Grey and Scott Summers' orders. For them to realize how important studying is for an X-Man, Jean levitated all of them with her telekinesis. Scott then used his optic blast to reflect through the walls and amaze the students as he sliced an apple with his optic blast. They also have messed with the Blackbird for having a joyride when they used it for fun. They drove the Blackbird recklessly putting them into danger. Following some events, Kitty Pryde and Kurt Wagner have decided to have a party in the Institute as they invite their friends from Bayville. When the X-Men discovered about this, they got scolded. After the people found out about the mutants, Wolfsbane and Jubilee left the Institute. Cannonball became closer to Wolverine as he races with him with their motorcycles. Some boys also opens up to Wolverine about them disliking their studies especially of Physics.During an encounter with a mutant who was named Dani Moonstar, she projected herself into Kitty's mind with a ghost shaft. In Kitty's imaginings, Dani became a member of the New Mutants. Dani have complications in controlling her powers at first and caused trouble to the minds of their teachers. However, it was revealed that Dani is unconscious while projecting herself to Kitty after the X-men and the New Mutants have saved her. She was then picked up by her grandfather Black Eagle. During the final battle against Apocalypse, Magneto, Mystique, Storm and Professor X were converted into Apocalypse's horseman. Each of the New Mutants were given different missions in different base of operations. Wolfsbane and Sunspot were along other mutants in Mexico to fight Magneto. Though, the united forces of the mutants have not succeeded against him. Wolfsbane, Sunspot and other mutants were seen unconscious after their fight and only Wanda, Kitty and the Brotherhood were left to fight him. Multiple Man and Magma were sent to Egypt to help Jean's team defeat Professor X. Using her powers, Amara created a fissure with magma inside it and Multiple Man duplicated himself into lots of duplicates while firing Xavier, however, most of his duplicates were defeated. Boom-Boom then created gigantic explosives for Colossus to throw on Xavier. Iceman and Berserker along with Spyke and Beast went to China to face Storm. Storm attacked them and Iceman created an ice cave to shield them. Berserker was then able to knock Storm out. But using her powers to make it rain, Berserker have electrified himself and went unconscious. Cannonball then accompanied Rogue to fetch Leech and borrow his powers to turn Apocalypse's machine off. He carried Rogue and fled inside the pyramid. Following the defeat of the aforementioned villain, anything was back to normal. In Professor X's vision about the X-Men, Jubilee have returned in the Institute and the New Mutants continued studying at Xavier's.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Thundercats storyline begins with the planet of Thundera. Thundera has inhabitants called the Thundercats who are cat-humanoids. Thundera is ruled by the Lord of the Thundercats, Claudus. As the story opens Thundera is under siege by a race of beings called The Mutants. The Mutants are comprised of a lizard/snake humanoid, an ape humanoid, and a jackal humanoid. Somehow the Mutants are going to blow up Thundera, and the nobles of this world are fleeing in a spaceship. These nobles become the main characters in this series. The Thundercat adults are comprised of <a href=\"/jaga/29-11144/\">Jaga</a>, <a href=\"/tygra/29-11140/\">Tygra</a>, <a href=\"/cheetara/29-11143/\">Cheetara</a>, and <a href=\"/panthro/29-11147/\">Panthro</a>. They also brought two children, <a href=\"/wilykit/29-11151/\">Wilykit</a> and <a href=\"/wilykat/29-11150/\">Wilykat</a>. Finally, the next in line for the Lord of the Thundercats position, a small cub name Lion-o with his chamberlain <a href=\"/snarf/29-11157/\">Snarf</a>. Snarf is a catlike creature whose tail can be used as an extra appendage to balance or grab things with. The nobles enter stasis pods on the ship to allow them to travel without aging while Jaga agrees to fly the ship.</p><p>This ship is being followed by a ship of <a href=\"/mutants-of-plun-darr/65-55879/\">Mutants</a> and crashes on the planet of Third Earth. All the Thundercats survive except Jaga. He is killed in the crash. Upon coming out of the pods it is discovered that Lion-O\u2019s stasis pods was not working. All of the Thundercats remained the same age during the flight while Lion-O aged to an adult. As an adult he is now the Lord of the Thundercats, and the group decides to remain on Third Earth and build a fortress, called <a href=\"/cats-lair/34-55876/\">Cat\u2019s Lair</a>.</p><p>Lion-O carries the Eye of Thundera, the source of the Thundercats\u2019 power. The Eye is embedded into the hilt of the <a href=\"/sword-of-omens/18-45529/\">Sword of Omens</a> which is wielded and responds to the current Lord of the Thundercats. Lion-O also has a shield called the Thundercats Claw. The Sword of Omens and the Eye of Thundera cannot be used for evil or against the Thundercat.</p><p>The Thundercats learn that Thundera was not fully destroyed and strive to return to search for survivors and the treasure of their people. Upon returning three more Thundercats are discovered. <a href=\"/pumyra/29-11148/\">Pumyra</a>, a medic and healer. <a href=\"/bengali/29-11142/\">Bengali</a>, a martial arts specialist. <a href=\"/lynx-o/29-11146/\">Lynx-O</a>, a blind wise-man. They also find a younger Snarf name Snarfer.</p><h2>Major villains</h2><h4><i>Mumm-Ra</i>:</h4><p>The Thundercats main villain is an evil being called Mumm-Ra. Mumm-Ra harnesses the power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to transform him from a frail mummy to an all-powerful being. Mumm-Ra enlists the help of numerous other villains throughout his time battling the Thundercats. Mumm-Ra also employs magic bestowed by the Spirits to trick the Thundercats. Mumm-Ra\u2019s main goal is to obtain The Sword of Omens and the Eye of Thundera embedded in its hilt. Mumm-Ra acquires a sidekick bulldog, Ma-Mutt. Mumm-Ra uses Ma-Mutt to spy and as the focus of many glamors to trick the Thundercats.</p><h4><i>Mutants of Plun-darr</i>:</h4><p>The Mutants of Plun-Darr ( <a href=\"/slithe/29-11155/\">Slithe</a>, <a href=\"/jackalman/29-11170/\">Jackalman</a>, <a href=\"/monkian/29-11154/\">Monkian</a>) are another villain often harassing the Thundercats. Slithe, a lizard man, is the unofficial leader of this group. They are also joined by two other mutants named <a href=\"/vultureman/29-11156/\">Vultureman</a> and <a href=\"/ratar-o/29-72046/\">Ratar-O.</a> Vultureman is the mechanic and engineer of the group. Ratar-O is a lesser seen member who has a space ship and more feared than the others. They land on Third Earth and create <a href=\"/castle-plun-darr/34-57129/\">Castle Plun-Darr</a>. From Castle Plun-Darr they employed different tactics to try to gain the Eye of Thundera and the Sword of Omens.</p><h4><i>Lunatacs</i>:</h4><p>Later in the series, a group from the moon of Third Earth come to the planet and become a third faction against the Thundercats. This group is called the Lunatacs. The Luntacs is led by <a href=\"/luna/29-11162/\">Luna</a>.

        "description":"<p>The Challengers of the Unknown is a group of fictional characters first drawn by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> for DC Comics. This quartet of adventurers explored science fictional and apparent paranormal occurrences and faced fantastic menaces. The scripts for the first stories are often credited to Dick and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dave-wood/26-48163/\">Dave Wood</a>, two brothers who also wrote other Kirby-illustrated material, such as the \"Sky Masters of the Space Force\" comic strip; but others have claimed that Kirby created the Challengers himself or together with former partner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joe-simon/26-9443/\">Joe Simon</a>. The Challengers are said to be part of the inspiration for the creation of the Fantastic Four at Marvel Comics.</p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s DC Comics used the ongoing series Showcase to introduce or re-imagine characters that they would then base a directorial decision about how to proceed with the characters whether they would be placed in their own series, take over other well established, introduced as supporting characters elsewhere, or simply be allowed to fade away. Among the more popular of the characters introduced here were the Atom and the Flash, but other characters went on to a degree of their own popularity. Once such group of characters was the Challengers of the Unknown who have maintained a constant if not overwhelming popularity at DC in the years since their introduction. The group debuted in Showcase #6 (February 1957) as acquaintances who miraculously survived a plane crash unscathed. They concluded that since they were \"living on borrowed time\", they should band together for hazardous adventures. The four \u2014 <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ace-morgan/29-16338/\">Kyle \"Ace\" Morgan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-ryan/29-23645/\">Matthew \"Red\" Ryan</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rocky-davis/29-16340/\">Leslie \"Rocky\" Davis</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prof-haley/29-24284/\">Walter Mark \"Prof\" Haley</a> \u2014 became the Challengers of the Unknown.</p><p>The inspiration for the Challengers' adventures were old serials, war movies, and drive-in science fiction. Superhero comics had mostly vanished by the mid-1950s; the revival of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, often seen as marking the return of the super-heroes to popularity, had occurred only a few months earlier, in Showcase #4. As larger-than-life heroes without super-powers but having super-adventures, the Challengers helped pave the way for the 1960's superheroes. Like war movies, their \"squad\" had the standard archetypes: Ace, the hotshot pilot and leader; Rocky, strong and dumb; Prof, the skinny brain; and Red, the hothead daredevil. The stories had weird menaces, fistfights, wild vehicles and gadgets, spectacular terrain, daring escapes, and a sense of humor.</p><p>The most noted influence of this creation was Kirby's next major continuing series, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/49-2045/\">The Fantastic Four</a>, which was essentially the Challengers as a superhero family, complete with a similar origin. Both groups were quartets who resolved to band together after a crash landing; but the Challengers lacked the strong characterizations and much of the humor that distinguished the Fantastic Four. In \"Challengers of the Unknown\" #3, Rocky was shot into space and returned with multiple superpowers including invisibility, flame throwing, freeze-ray throwing, giant-growth, super-speed and super-strength.</p><p>The series continued in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/showcase/49-1770/\">Showcase</a> for three more appearances (#7, 11, 12) then moved to its own title, considered among Kirby's most notable in that period. After 12 issues total, Kirby moved on, and while the title continued through issue #75 (Aug.-Sept. 1970, followed by intermittent reprint and revival issues from 1973-78), the series never achieved the same level of acclaim. It was a typical DC B-List comic, a steady seller like the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doom-patrol/49-2177/\">Doom Patrol</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sea-devils/49-2033/\">Sea Devils</a>.</p><p>Soon famous, the Challengers accepted many \"unknown challenges\" from the Pentagon, mad scientists, and people with a problem. Over time the \"Challs\" established the hollowed-out Challengers Mountain as headquarters. Later they adopted an hourglass logo to symbolize time running out. They encountered genies, common and sophisticated thieves, rocs, aliens and robots good and bad, mad scientists, and super villains. Their adventures followed the flow of other DC comics starting with \"Strange Adventures\", veering toward super heroics (during the Bat Craze), to occult menaces, through Bermuda Triangle weirdness, and finally to cancellation (1979). The Challengers traveled through space, time, and other dimensions. Guest stars included the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doom-patrol/65-5701/\">Doom Patrol</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadman/29-5690/\">Deadman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/swamp-thing/29-15809/\">Swamp Thing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jonny-double/29-34764/\">Jonny Double</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sea-devils/65-56085/\">Sea Devils</a>.</p><p>During a one issue crossover story with the Sea Devils in Challengers of the Unknown issue #47 they fought the criminal group known as Scorpio. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/june-robbins/29-24164/\">June Robbins</a>, a computer genius and archaeologist, joined the Challengers for many adventures as an \"honorary\" or \"girl\" Challenger, starting in their appearances in Showcase.</p><p>In a short-lived 1977 revival, the Challengers were a four-man, one-woman team again. The first came back in Super-Team Family #8-10, before getting their own title back with #81. They were joined by Deadman and Swamp Thing. June Robbins got a uniform and official status. No explanation for June's joining was given.</p><p>Their title was canceled with #87 in 1978, but they continued their storyline in Adventure #493-497. They also appeared in issues of Super-Team Family.</p><h2>Volume 2</h2><p>The Challengers were revamped with a \"Dark Knight\" cast in Volume 2 (1991) by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jeph-loeb/26-40472/\">Jeph Loeb</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tim-sale/26-5543/\">Tim Sale</a>. The Challs were semi-retired, their mountain a theme park, and their adventures disregarded as cooked-up articles in \"The Tattletale\". Other-dimensional experiments and a bomb blew up the mountain and nearby town. Prof and June were presumed killed. Red, Rocky, and Ace were tried and ordered to disband. The three drifted apart, dogged by a ghostly Prof and June, then reunited to defeat a space-demon causing worldwide suicides and madness. \"The New Challengers of the Unknown\", including ghostly Prof and June, were poised to take on menaces in the dark corners of the DCU. Loeb planned a second miniseries to reset the Challs to youth and heroism, but it never materialized.</p><p>The mini series was 8 issues. It was reprinted in trade paperback as Challengers of the Unknown Must Die! in 2004.</p><h2>Volume 3</h2><p>The Challengers were revamped again by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steven-grant/26-41567/\">Steven Grant</a> in Volume 3 (1997). Four new Challengers pursued X-Files-like horrors. They were <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clay-brody/29-23544/\">Clay Brody</a>, NASCAR driver; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brenda-ruskin/29-23787/\">Brenda Ruskin</a>, physicist; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kenn-kawa/29-23545/\">Kenn Kawa</a>, radical games designer; and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marlon-corbet/29-23592/\">Marlon Corbet</a>, commercial pilot, who also miraculously survived a plane crash. They stopped sacrificial wackos, drug-juiced zombies, vengeful ghosts, Amazon cults, Lovecraftian monsters, mass suicides, humming buildings, and other oddities. They were advised by Rocky Davis, older and grayer and alone. It was eventually revealed the original Challengers were dematerialized by a mad scientist's ray-weapon. The same ray caused both plane crashes, as well as others. Soon the original Challs reappeared, helped the young Challs defeat the madman, then walked back into oblivion (minus a wounded Rocky) to shut down a runaway Tesla field. The young Challengers vowed to fight on - until cancellation in 1998 with issue #18.</p><p>The missing Challengers - Ace, Red, Prof, and June - were discovered by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> in Hypertime. The team was waging guerrilla war against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-zero/29-17785/\">Black Zero</a> (a Superboy variant). With Black Zero defeated, the team returned to Earth, but lost Red Ryan along the way. Reunited with Rocky in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a>, hosted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rip-hunter/29-4937/\">Rip Hunter</a>, the original Challengers vowed to explore Hypertime, \"the greatest unknown,\" to find Red.</p><p>Two Challengers partook in Infinite Crisis. Rocky Davis and Prof Haley helped stem the escape of prisoners from Blackgate Prison (Villains United: Infinite Crisis Special 1) and Rocky fought in the Battle for Metropolis (Infinite Crisis 7).</p><h2>Other Info</h2><p>In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amalgam-comics/57-2014/\">Amalgam Comics</a>, the Challengers were amalgamated with their super-powered counterparts, the Fantastic Four, to form the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/challengers-of-the-fantastic/65-57062/\">Challengers of the Fantastic</a>.</p><p>In 2010, the Challengers of the Unknown where also seen in Justice League of America #42 back in the past where they found a alien weapon that can whip out their minds. The Challengers of the Unknown called the Metal Men to take care of the problem before anyone gets hurt.</p><p>In the DC Comics relanch in 2012 issue #6 and 7 also 8. The Challengers of the Unknown where seen again in DC Unverise Presents.and it turned out to be a adventure tv show for everyone to enjoy to see there adventures who was missing or killed in the series as there crazy adventure countinues.</p><p>Media</p><p>The Challengers of the Unknown where seen on Batman:The Brave and the Bold defeting a starfish with the help of Batman and later team up with Batman and the Justice League and the Teen Titans to fight off the enemy starfish called Starro.</p>",

The previous incarnation of Avengers were very much like their Earth-616 counterparts until they learned of a monumental threat from the reality of Earth-9907.</p><p>In this reality, the Nazis won World War II and the ruler of the entire world was <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Victor Von Doom</a> (known to Earth-616 as Dr.Doom). He was on the verge of mastering a Universal Cube which would allow him to invade other realities. Earth-982's Avengers created a portal into Earth-9907 in which to stop Doom. The confronted their counterparts in that world known as the <a href=\"/thunder-guard/65-56124/\">Thunder Guard</a>, this universe's twisted version of the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> under Doom's control.</p><p>Many Avengers of Earth-928 perished during that battle with the Thunder Guard, but they did succeed in slowing down Doom's plan. One of the few survivors, Captain America stayed behind in Earth-9907 to lead the local resistance against Doom. Only six Avengers returned to earth: <a href=\"/clint-barton/29-1475/\">Hawkeye (Clint Barton)</a> whom had been blinded in battle; <a href=\"/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules,</a>whom was driven mad by his experiences and had to be sealed in an <a href=\"/adamantium/18-40759/\">adamantium</a> prison; the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>; <a href=\"/vision/29-1504/\">the Vision</a> whom later became adviser to the U.S President; <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">the Wasp</a> who was distraught over the death of her husband <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a>; and <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>.</p><p>To prevent any further interaction with Earth-9906, Iron Man was forced to place the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> into a stasis field and used her powers to seal the rift. Shortly afterward, a weary Tony Stark decided that he could not longer continue as Iron Man and chose to retire.</p><p>Other heroes couldn't just sit by and let the Avengers fail apart and make no effort to fix the situation so several heroes like <a href=\"../../jolt/29-3284/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jolt,</a> <a href=\"../../jubilee/29-4562/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jubilee</a>, <a href=\"../../nova/29-2105/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nova</a>, <a href=\"../../robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speedball</a>, and the <a href=\"../../steel-spider/29-18429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steel Spider</a> tried to continue the Avengers; however, it ultimately failed and the group finally disbanded.

Although the mace's magic appeared to be gone, the trickster <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> dispatched trolls to Earth to steal it from Kevin when he found it.

Loki captured all six of them easily and brought them to Asgard while he tried to awaken the magic of the mighty mace. When he cast a spell, Kevin lunged at the mace which bonded the mace to him and granted him it's powers.

Speedball, Jolt and Jubilee declined full time service as Avengers; but Stinger, J2, and Kevin Masterson who assumed the identity of the new Thunderstrike agreed and formed A-Next.</p><p>Once more, Avengers Headquarters served as the base of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, but was simultaneously open as a public museum.
