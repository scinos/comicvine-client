        "description":"<p>The movie starts off in a flashback. Bruce was still a young child, playing in the backyard of his home with Rachel Dawes. Bruce falls into a well and into a cave, where he is attacked by a horde of bats. His dad eventually gets him out and takes him into the house, and then Bruce awakens from the dream. He is a young adult in a foreign prison, where he fights criminals one by one. Eventually Bruce meets a man named Henri Ducard, who offers him a chance to join the League of Shadows as long as he gathers a rare flower. Bruce succeeds and climbs the mountain up to Henri Ducard. After he arrives, he meets <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra\u2019s al Ghul</a> and tells Ducard about how his parent</p><p>died and the guilt and anger that he carries. Ducard begins training Bruce the way of the ninja. During the training, Bruce tells Ducard about the reason he did not avenge his parents during the trial of Joe Chill (killer of the Waynes and also the same killer in the comics), and then how he became a criminal in order to learn how they think, which is how Bruce ended up in prison in the first place. Bruce completes his final test; however, he has to execute a criminal in order to become a full member. But Bruce does not want to become an executioner. He instead flings a hot brand onto the explosives, detonating them all. Bruce fights Ra\u2019s Al Ghul until the roof collapses onto the latter. Bruce then saves Ducard from falling off the cliff, then he returns to Gotham via private jet with Alfred. Back in Gotham, Bruce discovers a huge cave underneath the mansion. Later, Bruce shows up at Wayne Enterprises, surprising all the executives because Bruce had been declared dead years ago.</p><p>Bruce asks for a job at the applied sciences department. Heading over there, he discovers the vast amount of technology there. He meets Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and gets a tour. Bruce asks to \u201cborrow\u201d the suit for cave diving. He then continues working on the cave, installing lights and then discovering more areas in the cave. Bruce then began ordering parts from dummy corporations to build himself a Bat costume. Later that night, Bruce goes out with the armor and a ski mask. He sneaks up on Officer James Gordon, and tells him about the plan to put criminals behind bars. He tells him to look for his sign.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2128354\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128354-batmanbeginsprofpic_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2128354\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128354-batmanbeginsprofpic_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Bruce eventually gets all the equipment needed to make his Bat Suit and on his first night out on patrol he encounters Carmine Falcone and his goons exporting /importing drugs with a crooked cop. Once he takes care of all Falcone's men he goes after Falcone after asking who he is he simply says \"I'm Batman.\" Afterward Gordon arrives seeing Falcone's men, but doesn't think anything of it because there is no connection to Falcone. However he learns that Falcone is on the grounds tied up to a Flood light and when Gordon looks out to see how it shines we get our first crude Bat Signal.</p><p>After Bruce''s first night out on the job, Alfred notices the bruises and advises Bruce to get an alibi for all his injuries, he suggests Polo. Dr. Crane goes to see Falcone in prison, who wants to be transferred to Arkham. We learn that Crane is working for someone and shows <a href=\"/carmine-falcone/29-42288/\">Falcone</a> the scarecrow mask. Bruce goes out to insure his Public identity as Bruce Wayne, coming across as a spoiled playboy, buying a hotel after his dates start swimming in a pool. He later goes on Patrol and finds Crane's hideout, however he is affected by the fear gas and has to flee, calling Alfred for help.</p><p>Days go by and eventually Bruce recovers, Alfred tells him Lucius Fox helped supply an antidote for the weaponized hallucinogen. Bruce asks Fox to make some more. Rachel stops by and drops off his birthday present before having to go to the Narrows to talk to Crane. Bruce rushes to his cave telling Alfred to entertain his guests until he returns.</p><p>At Arkham when Rachel asks too many questions Crane is forced to give a concentrated dose of his fear Toxin. Batman arrives and having been immunized against the toxin, uses it on Crane, who talks. He says Ra's Al Ghul is the person behind everything, including adding the toxin to the water supply. Before Batman can get anything more out of him the police arrive. The cops want to wait for SWAT but Gordon goes in anyway. Batman grabs him explaining the situation and asks him to take her and meet him out back. Once there Batman takes her to the Bat Cave, although making some additions to the nightly news on the way. When he releases Rachel from the Toxin he gives her a sedative and goes upstairs to the party. Alfred tells him he needs to be careful and not show off to which Bruce replies Rachel is downstairs, take her home. As Bruce enters the party he goes to Fox, who tells him he was just fired, but Bruce wants him back at Wayne Enterprises to make more Vaccines for the Toxin. As Bruce tries to make his way around the party he is introduced to Ra's Al Ghul, who he believes to be dead, however it turns out that Ra's is actually Ducard. Ra's tells him to either get the people out of the house or he will make a scene. Bruce takes this time to become \"drunk\" and tells his guests to get the hell out. As the guest leave Bruce sees all the Assassins in the room. Ra's tells him his plans of destroying Gotham and wants Bruce to join him. He also learns that this isn't the first time Gotham has been targeted for destruction. Bruce tells him Gotham isn't beyond saving. Ra's gives the order to his men to start burning his house, as Ra's tells him he never minded his surroundings as a beam falls on Bruce. \"You burned my house and left me for dead. Consider us even.\" As Wayne Manor is burning Alfred returns and finds Bruce helping him down to the cave.</p><p>Bruce is distraught, everything his father built is burning because of him. Alfred sees that Bruce is bleeding but tells him \"Why do we fall, Sir? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.\" A line his father told him when he was little. As Bruce heads out to save Gotham, Rachel goes to the Narrows to give Gordon his anti-Toxin. As the bridges close and the gas released Gordon is the only one left and calls for back-up. Commissioner Loeb tells him there is no one left, as Batman, in the <a href=\"../../batmobile/18-41463/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batmobile</a> jumps the gap. He has Gordon go to Wayne Tower to try to Blow up the tracks as he goes to fight Ra's. Along the way, he saves Rachel, who asks who he is. He responds \"It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\" Something she told Bruce Wayne earlier and realizes who Batman really is. As Bruce begins to fight Ra's on the train, Ra's believes he's trying to stop the train, but instead he insures that the train doesn't stop. As Gordon blows up the tracks he tells Ra's he never did mind his own surroundings. Ra's believes Bruce is going to kill him to which he replies \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.\" As he leaves Ra's on the train as it crashes.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2128359\"><div class=\"wiki-img-center\"><div class=\"wiki-img-super\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128359-batman_begins_1_1_.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2128359\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128359-batman_begins_1_1__super.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The following day Bruce hires Fox as CEO and fires the previous one. Heading back to Wayne Manor he talks to Rachel who tells him, if one day Gotham doesn't need Batman she will be there waiting for him. When asked what he will do with the Manor he replies \"Rebuild it, Brick by Brick\" exactly the way it was. Alfred tells him they could do something in the southeast corner, referring to the <a href=\"../../batcave/34-31340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat-cave</a>.</p><p>Jim Gordon has been promoted and signals Batman with a <a href=\"../../bat-signal/18-55819/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat Signal</a>, joking that he couldn't find any mob bosses. He then questions about the escalation that is going to happen because of Batman. He gives Batman a case. Double Homicide and leaves a calling card. It is revealed to be a Joker card. Batman says he'll look into it. Gordon says he never got to thank him, to which Batman replies \"and You'll never have to.\" Batman jumps off the building and circles around as the movie ends.</p><h3>Comic Book Adaptations</h3><p>1) <a href=\"/batman-begins-the-movie-and-other-tales-of-the-dark-knight/49-31294/\">Batman Begins: The Movie and Other Tales of the Dark Knight</a></p><p>2) <a href=\"/batman-begins-official-movie-adaptation/49-44587/\">Batman Begins: Official Movie Adaptation</a></p>",

        "description":"<p>In Gotham City, the Joker robs a mob bank with his accomplices, who he tricks into killing one another, ultimately killing the last one himself. That night, Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon contemplate including new district attorney Harvey Dent in their plan to eradicate the mob. However, Batman questions if Dent can be trusted. Bruce runs into Rachel Dawes and Dent, who are dating, and after talking to Dent, he realizes Dent's sincerity and decides to host a fundraiser for him. Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen meet with other underworld gangsters to discuss both Batman and Dent, who have been cracking down on the mobster's operations. Lau, a Chinese mafia accountant, informs them that he has hidden their money and fled to Hong Kong in an attempt to preempt Gordon's plan to seize the mobsters' funds and hide from Dent's jurisdiction. The Joker appears and offers to kill Batman for half of the mafia's money, but they flatly refuse and Gambol places a bounty on the Joker's head. Not long after, the Joker kills Gambol and takes control of his men.</p><p>In Hong Kong, Batman captures Lau and delivers him to the Gotham City police, where Lau agrees to testify against the mob. In retaliation, the mobsters hire the Joker to kill Batman and Lau. The Joker issues an ultimatum to Gotham: people will die each day until Batman reveals his identity. When Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and Judge Surillo are murdered by corrupt police, the public readily blames Batman, prompting Bruce to decide to reveal his identity. Before Bruce can turn himself in, Dent holds a press conference to try and persuade the public not to sell Batman out just because of one terrorist, but the public, though grateful for everything Batman has done for the city, insists that things have now reached a point where Batman must make the sacrifice, so Dent announces that he himself is Batman and is arrested as part of a plan to draw the Joker out of hiding. The Joker attempts to ambush the police convoy carrying Dent, but Batman and Gordon intervene and capture him. In recognition of his actions, Gordon is appointed the new police commissioner.</p><p>Later that night, Dent and Dawes disappear. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that Dent and Dawes' police escorts were on Maroni's payroll and have placed them in warehouses rigged with explosives on opposite sides of the city \u2014 far enough apart so that Batman cannot save them both. Batman leaves to save Dawes, while Gordon and the police head after Dent. With the aid of a smuggled bomb, the Joker escapes police custody with Lau. Batman arrives, but finds Dent instead of Dawes. Batman successfully saves Dent, but the ensuing explosion disfigures Dent's face. Gordon arrives at Dawes' location too late, and she perishes when the bomb detonates. Unable to cope with this new level of chaos, Maroni goes to Gordon and offers him the Joker's location.</p><p>Aboard a cargo ship, the Joker burns Lau to death atop a pile of the mob's money, and has the Chechen killed before taking control of his men. Meanwhile, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, Coleman Reese, finds out Batman's identity and after failing to blackmail the company, decides to go public. However, realizing that he does what he does only because of Batman, The Joker changes his mind about revealing Batman's identity and issues a public ultimatum: either Reese is killed, or he will blow up a hospital. When the police refuse to carry out his demands, The Joker goes to the evacuated hospital, disguised as a nurse, and frees Dent from his restraints, convincing him to exact revenge on the people responsible for Dawes' death, as well as Batman and Gordon for not saving her. Dent begins by flipping for the Joker's life, and spares him. The Joker destroys the hospital on his way out, and then escapes with a hijacked bus full of hospital patients.</p><p>Out of the hospital, Dent goes on a personal vendetta, confronting Maroni and the corrupt cops one by one. Now with complete control over the Gotham mob, the Joker announces to the public that anyone left in Gotham at nightfall will be subject to his rule. With the bridges and tunnels out of the city closed due to a bomb threat by the Joker, authorities begin evacuating people by ferry. The Joker has explosives placed on two of the ferries\u2014one ferry with convicts, who were evacuated in an effort to keep the Joker from freeing them, and the other with civilians\u2014telling the passengers the only way to save themselves is to trigger the explosives on the other ferry; otherwise, he will destroy both at midnight. Batman locates the Joker and the hostages he has taken. Realizing the Joker has disguised the hostages as his own men, Batman is forced to attack both Gordon's SWAT team and the Joker's henchmen in order to save the real hostages.</p><p>The Joker's plan to destroy the ferries fails after the passengers on both decide not to destroy each other. Batman finds the Joker, and after a brief fight, is able to subdue him, preventing him from destroying both ferries. When Batman refuses to kill the Joker, the Joker acknowledges that Batman is truly incorruptible, but that Dent was not, and that he has unleashed Dent upon the city. Leaving the Joker for the SWAT team, Batman searches for Dent. At the remains of the building where Dawes died, Batman finds Dent holding Gordon and his family at gunpoint. Dent judges the innocence of Batman, himself, and Gordon's son through three coin tosses. As the result of the first two flips, he shoots Batman and spares himself. Before Dent can determine the boy's fate, Batman, who\u2019s body armor blocked most of the damage, tackles him over the side of the building. Gordon's son is saved, but Dent and Batman fall to the ground below resulting in Dent's death. Knowing that the citizens of Gotham will lose hope and all morale if Dent's rampage goes public, Batman convinces Gordon to hold him responsible for the murders. Police swarm the building, and Batman flees as Gordon and his son watch as Batman manages to escape the Police. Later Gordon is shown delivering the eulogy at Dent's funeral and smashing the Bat-Signal.</p>",

The terrorists imprison him in a cave along with <a href=\"/yinsen/29-7858/\">Yinsen</a>, an engineer. Slowly dying from the injuries sustained in his capture, Tony creates an electromagnet with the help of Yinsen which keeps the shrapnel away from his heart. Soon they begin work on an arc reactor and a power suit which will aid in their escape. Completing it in secret, Stark manages to escape, in the process destroying much of the terrorist base with his suit's weapons. He crashes it in the desert shortly after escaping, and is rescued.</p><p>Upon returning home, Stark insists that <a href=\"/stark-industries/65-56840/\">Stark Industries</a> cease production of weaponry, to the consternation of <a href=\"/obadiah-stane/29-31197/\">Obadiah Stane</a>, Stark's father's business partner and manager of the company, who believes this will ruin the business. Meanwhile, Stark works on creating a vastly improved version of his suit. Learning that Stark weapons are being used by the Ten Rings, and that Stane is attempting to take over control of the company, an angered Stark flies to Afghanistan and stops a Ten Rings attack on Yinsen's home village. On his return flight he is attacked by members of the <a href=\"/us-air-force/65-44417/\">US Air Force</a>, and is forced to reveal his secret identity to <a href=\"/mauler/29-13921/\">James Rhodes</a> in order to end the attack. In Afghanistan, members of the Ten Rings, working together with Stane, salvage the wrecked remains of Stark's original suit. Stane has the group destroyed, and reverse engineers a version of the suit. In pursuit of the person who is leaking Stark technology to the Ten Rings, Stark sends his assistant <a href=\"/pepper-potts/29-4263/\">Pepper Potts</a> to investigate the computer systems at Stark Industries. She learns of Stane's involvement with, and later reveals this information to <a href=\"/agent-coulson/29-70860/\">Agent Coulson</a> of <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>.</p><p>Stane, frustrated by his inability to create a working arc reactor, attacks Stark and steals his arc reactor, paralyzing him and dooming him to a slow death from the shrapnel. Stark is able to save himself using his original arc reactor. He confronts Stane wearing his armour, while Stane is similarly outfitted in his reverse engineered suit. The pair fight, and Stark is able to defeat Stane by orchestrating the overload of a massive arc reactor; Stane dies in the explosion. Stark reveals his identity as Iron Man at a press conference, contravening the orders of Agent Coulson.</p>",

        "description":"<p>An old legend of the West is that of the Ghost Rider. Supposedly, when someone sold their sold to the devil, they would be transformed into the Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter. The devil's most recent Ghost Rider was around 150 years ago, but disobeyed the devil by refusing to bring him the contract of San Venganza, which would give him the power of 1000 souls.</p><p>In the present, a stunt rider called Barton Blaze and his son Johnny Blaze are carnival daredevils. Johnny is currently dating a young girl his age named Roxanne Simpson. After a show one day, Johnny goes home to find that his father is dying of cancer. That night, a mysterious man appears, and claims that he can cure Johnny's cancer, in return for Johnny's soul. Thinking it's a joke, Johnny agrees. The next day, Johnny's father is healthy once more, but during the performance that day, Johnny's father dies in an accident. Johnny finds the mysterious man who he made the deal with, and claims he's cheated on their deal, but the mysterious man points out that he saved him from the cancer as promised. He says that one day he'll come back to make sure Johnny fulfils his end of the deal.</p><p>About ten years later, Johnny is a famous stunt rider, who is famous for surviving incredibly unbelievable feats. Just before he jumps a football pitch, Johnny bumps into Roxanne Simpson again, who is now a reporter. After the show, Johnny follows Roxanne and asks her out on a date. Roxanne reluctantly agrees.</p><p>Meanwhile, the demon Blackheart is on Earth, looking for the contract of San Venganza. He enlists the aid of three demons named Gressil, Abigor, and Wallow, who represent the elements of earth, air and water respectively. The mysterious man who made the deal with Johnny is revealed to be Mephistopholes (shortened to Mephisto), Blackheart's father and a high-ranking demon. Mephisto wants the contract of San Vanganza for himself, so calls on Johnny to fulfil his end of the deal.</p><p>Johnny is turned into the latest Ghost Rider, and is sent to stop Blackheart. Blackheart, Gressil, Abigor and Wallow are at a trainyard where a graveyard used to be which held the contract of San Venganza. Ghost Rider appears, and manages to use a nearby chain to kill Gressil, although Blackheart, Abigor and Wallow escape. After the fight, Ghost Rider keeps the chain, and keeps riding. He saves a civilian from a mugger, and uses his patented Penance Stare for the first time.</p><p>The next morning, Johnny wakes up in the cemetary of a church. There, a mysterious old man tells Johnny about his curse, and a bit about how to control it. Johnny also goes home and reads a few books on how he can control it. Roxanne arrives, thinking Johnny stood her up on their date. Johnny tries to explain to Roxanne about how he turned into Ghost Rider, but she naturally doesn't believe him.</p><p>Johnny is then arrested by the police, believed to be connected to the murder at the trainyard. The police take him into a cell, where Johnny turns into Ghost Rider. He then attempts to find Blackheart, but Blackheart sends Abigor to delay him. Ghost Rider chases Abigor to the top of a building, and manages to use his chains to suck him up. While Ghost Rider is chasing Abigor, Roxanne sees him and realises Johnny was telling the truth. Roxanne is part of a crowd which watches Ghost Rider leave, and Blackheart realises she is Ghost Rider's weakness.</p><p>The next day, Johnny returns to his apartment to find that Roxanne is held captive by Blackheart and he will kill her if he doesn't get the contract of San Venganza. Johnny tries the Penance Stare on Blackheart, but it doesn't work as Blackheart has no soul.</p><p>Johnny then goes to the caretaker at the cemetary, who reveals that he was Carter Slade, the last Ghost Rider, and the one who has hidden the contract all these years. Carter gives Johnny the contract, which is hidden in his hollowed-out spade. Carter can turn into Ghost Rider one last time, and rides with Johnny to the town of San Venganza. He gives Johnny a shotgun then leaves.</p><p>Johnny approaches the town, but is ambushed by Wallow. Fortunately, he is killed by Ghost Rider's hellfire, allowing him to continue on his way. Inside the town, Johnny gives the contract to Blackheart, who then attempts to kill Ghost Rider. Johnny manages to turn the shotgun Carter gave him into a \"hellfire shotgun\", but it still isn't enough to kill Blackheart. Johnny then attempts a Penance Stare, which works this time as Blackheart has 1000 souls in him.</p><p>Mephisto then tells Johnny that he has kept his side of the bargain, and is free to go. Johnny decides that he wants to keep the Ghost Rider curse so that he can use it for good.</p><p>The film ends on Johnny and Roxanne kissing at a tree where they carved their initials when they were younger.</p>",
