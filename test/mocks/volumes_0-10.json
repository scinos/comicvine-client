        "description":"<p>Superman launched May 18, 1939 with its first issue (that doesn't actually have a #1 on the cover) and although it was a seasonal book for its first five issues, with its sixth it began a bimonthly publishing rate and kept up with said rate until its eighty-fifth. With its eighty-sixth issue Superman began it's mostly consistent monthly publishing rate which it continued using up until 1986 when the series ended at 423 issues, the last issue featuring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-moore/26-40382/\">Alan Moore</a>'s acclaimed story \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" After that, the title's numbering was continued through Adventures of Superman which lasted for several decades. It was in 2006 with #650 that the title returned to its original name, kicking off it's new era with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/one-year-later/39-40777/\">One Year Later</a> storyline co-written by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/geoff-johns/26-40439/\">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurt-busiek/26-41741/\">Kurt Busiek</a>. After the arc, the series was written by Busiek from 654-675, with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/james-robinson/26-42389/\">James Robinson</a> taking the reigns in 677 and holding them tight until the milestone 700th issue where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-michael-straczynski/26-40683/\">JMS</a> took over with an arc entitled \"<a href=\"/grounded/39-56189/\">Grounded</a>\" that would feature Superman walking across America. However, JMS left the book earlier then planned and new writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-roberson/26-19991/\">Chris Roberson</a> worked off of JMS' original notes and plotline. Unfortunately, Roberson never got to prove himself with his own story on the book as with the launch of The New 52 in September 2011, after 72 years and 714 issues (including Adventures of Superman) Superman Vol. 1 came to an end with the final chapter of the Grounded story arc serving as the final issue of the series. Superman will survive as an ongoing series at DC, with the month following the release of Superman #714 serving as the launching point of the third ongoing <a href=\"/superman/49-42986/\">Superman</a> series in DC history with #1.</p><h4>For Post <a href=\"/flashpoint/39-56280/\">Flashpoint</a> volume 3, refer to <a href=\"/superman/49-42986/\">Superman</a>.</h4><p>General Notes</p><p>Superman #424-649 do not exist, however, the issues that took those numbers can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adventures-of-superman/49-3778/\">Adventures of Superman</a> page.</p><p>Another ongoing title from DC entitled Superman does exist and was published with its own numbering while Adventures of Superman was in print, thus even though this title began publication in the 30's and lasted until 2011, no two Superman titles were hitting shelves at the same time.

        "description":"<p>The entire run of Batman still stands upon large controversies over who actually came up with some of the characters. <a href=\"/bob-kane/26-19137/\">Bob Kane</a> supposedly came up with the idea for the hero, but it has been suggested that he only came up with a \"Bird-man\" and <a href=\"/bill-finger/26-43591/\">Bill Finger</a> suggested he be a \"Bat-man\". Both creators however, share credit for this character. As for the <a href=\"/joker/29-1702/\">Joker</a>, the first concept sketch was drawn by <a href=\"/jerry-robinson/26-9680/\">Jerry Robinson</a>, but Kane disputed that his input was \"minimal\" suggesting he and Bill came up with the idea. Kane also finagled many legal aspects of Batman related print and media. Every movie and comic reads \"Batman created by Bob Kane\" when it should read \"Batman created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger\". However It is not disputed that Robinson and Finger came up with the character, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Robin</a> after \"Robinhood\" . Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff co-created numerous bat-creations including <a href=\"/alfred/29-5556/\">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, <a href=\"/poison-ivy/29-1697/\">Poison Ivy,</a> <a href=\"/mr-freeze/29-3715/\">Mr. Freeze</a>, <a href=\"/batwoman/29-9052/\">Batwoman</a>, <a href=\"/batgirl/49-7205/\">Batgirl</a> as well as <a href=\"/bat-mite/29-23170/\">Bat-Mite</a> and <a href=\"/ace-the-bat-hound/29-31302/\">Ace the Bat Hound</a> just to name a few. <a href=\"/bill-finger/26-43591/\">Bill Finger</a> also co-created <a href=\"/penguin/29-4885/\">Penguin</a>, <a href=\"/riddler/29-3718/\">Riddler</a>, and <a href=\"/catwoman/29-1698/\">Catwoman</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1681131\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/1681131-batman1ad_super.jpg\" title=\"Ad for Batman #1\"><img id=\"1681131\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/1681131-batman1ad_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ad for Batman #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ad for Batman #1</div></div></div></div><p>One of DC's longest running books showcasing the adventures of the Dark Knight, <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>. Through out the years, a majority of Batman's marquee story lines have happened within the pages of this book including, but not limited to the death of the second Robin, <a href=\"/jason-todd/29-6849/\">Jason Todd</a>, and <a href=\"/bane/29-6129/\">Bane</a> breaking Batman's back, leading to <a href=\"/jean-paul-valley/29-12834/\">Jean-Paul Valley</a> to assume the role of Batman for a period of time in the 90s.</p><p>In 2006, super-star writer <a href=\"/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> took over the book. Morrison wrote stories that introduced readers to Bruce's son <a href=\"/damian-wayne/29-42413/\">Damian Wayne</a> as well as putting Bruce through a series of near fatal trials against <a href=\"/black-glove/65-54825/\">The Black Glove</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-hurt/29-54826/\">Doctor Hurt</a>, leading up to the epic 2008 story lines of <a href=\"/batman-rip/39-55116/\">Batman RIP</a> and <a href=\"/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a> where Bruce Wayne had apparently died at the hands of the evil god <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>.</p><p>After Bruce's \"death,\" and the <a href=\"/battle-for-the-cowl/39-55808/\">Battle for the Cowl</a>, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Dick Grayson</a>, the first Robin, took up the mantle of Batman, continuing to protect Gotham exactly as his mentor had. He even took in Damian as his own Robin. With the exception of two issues set prior to the events of <a href=\"/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a>, Dick Grayson has been the star of the book since issue #687.</p><p>When the super hero community learned that Bruce Wayne had never actually died, and was sent back in time by Darkseid, Dick Grayson eventually knew that his time as Batman would soon end. But with Bruce's return, and formation of <a href=\"/batman-inc/65-57839/\">Batman Incorporated</a>, Bruce deemed Dick Grayson the Batman of Gotham City, as he traveled the world, searching for more recruits for his new organization.</p><p><a href=\"/charles-paris/26-38494/\">Charles Paris</a> has drawn the most issues of Batman thus far at 128. <a href=\"/dennis-oneil/26-40861/\">Denny O'Neil</a> is a long time writer and editor at DC with 211 issues. He also contributed the location of <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/34-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a> as well as the characters <a href=\"/man-bat/29-6131/\">Man-Bat</a>, <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra's al Ghul</a> and <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/29-4917/\">Talia al Ghul</a>.</p><p>In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched their entire line in an event known as \"<a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">The New 52</a>\" which would see the premiere of fifty-two new titles, thus the long-running Batman series ended with #713 during <a href=\"/tony-daniel/26-4663/\">Tony S. Daniel</a>'s run on the title. In the new line, however, Tony Daniel will continue writing in the \"Batman universe\" but under the character's other main title, <a href=\"/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a>. The new Batman series will be written instead by Scott Snyder (who was writing Detective Comics pre-relaunch).</p><h4>For Post <a href=\"/flashpoint/39-56280/\">Flashpoint</a> volume 2, refer to <a href=\"/batman/49-42721/\">Batman</a>.</h4><p><b>Trade Volumes that collect Batman issues:</b></p><p><b>Classic and Archived Batman:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-one/37-233426/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 1</a> (Batman #1, Detective Comics #27-37)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-two/37-233429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 2</a> (Batman #2-3, Detective Comics #39-45, New York World's Fair Comic #2)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-three/37-233431/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 3</a> (Batman #4-5, Detective Comics #46-50, World's Finest #1)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-four/37-233433/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 4</a> (Batman #6-7, Detective Comics #51-56, World's Finest #2-3)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-five/37-233436/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 5</a> (Batman #8-9, Detective Comics #57-61, World's Finest #4)</li></ul><p><i>see also Batman Archives, Batman: The Dark Knight Archives, Batman: The Dynamic Duo Archives etc...</i></p><p><b>Modern Batman</b> (Post-Crisis)</p><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-year-one/49-18960/\">Batman: Year One</a> (Batman #404-407)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-the-many-deaths-of-batman/49-37883/\">Batman: The Many Deaths of Batman</a> (Batman #433-435)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-ten-nights-of-the-beast/49-34113/\">Batman: Ten Nights of the Beast</a> (#417-420)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-a-death-in-the-family/49-25187/\">Batman: A Death in the Family</a> (Batman #426-429)</li><li><a href=\"/robin-the-teen-wonder/49-38554/\">Robin: The Teen Wonder</a> (Batman #428 and 442, <span>Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #100, Nightwing #101, Batman #428 and 442, Robin #126 and 132, and Teen Titans #29)</span></li><li><a href=\"/robin-a-hero-reborn/49-20003/\">Robin: A Hero Reborn</a> (Batman #455-457 and Robin #1-5)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-knightfall-vol-1-broken-bat/37-217582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Knightfall Part 1: Broken Bat</a> (Batman #491-497, Detective Comics #659-663)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-knightfall-vol-2-who-rules-the-night/37-217584/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Knightfall Part 2: Who Rules the Night</a> (Batman #498-500, Detective Comics #664-666, Showcase '93 #7-8, Shadow of the Bat #16-18)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-knightfall-vol-3-knightsend/37-217586/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Knightfall Part 3: Knightsend</a> (Batman #509-510)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-1/37-118196/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 1</a> ( Batman #563-564, No Man's Land #1, Shadow of the Bat #83-84, Detective Comics #730-731, Legends of the Dark Knight #116)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-2/37-131427/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 2</a> (Batman #565, Shadow of the Bat #85-87, Detective Comics #732-733, Legends of the Dark Knight #117, #119, Batman Chronicles #16)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-three/37-131428/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 3</a> (Batman #566-569, Shadow of the Bat #88, Detective Comics #734-735, Legends of the Dark Knight #120-121)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-four/37-131446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 4</a> (Batman #571-572, Shadow of the Bat #92-93, Detective Comics #736, #
