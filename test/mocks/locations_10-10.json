        "description":"<p>To outsiders, Khera seems like a utopia, with its highly advanced technology, crime-free cities and fair government. In reality this is the furthest thing from the truth. Despite how things may have been in the past, present-day Khera is a planet populated by elitists. They live in a system that separates people by race, sex, species and type of superhuman ability. There are 3 types of being that are considered true Kherubim on Khera. The Pantheon (of which <a href=\"/mr-majestic/29-21972/\"> Mr. Majestic</a>, <a href=\"/mythos/29-21966/\"> Mythos</a>, <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\"> Spartan</a>, <a href=\"/imperator/29-40714/\"> Imperator</a>, <a href=\"/lord-entropy/29-40880/\"> Lord Entropy</a> and <a href=\"/emp/29-21970/\"> Emp</a> are members) consists of all males who possess a <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\"> Superman</a> power set. High ranking Pantheon members are also called \"Lords\" and are capable of becoming \"High Lords\". High Lords can abandon their physical bodies and ascend to a higher level of being. After the Pantheon there are males and females who are \"normal\" by Kheran standards. All their physical attributes are superhuman (though not nearly as high as that of Pantheon members) and they extremely long lived. The Coda (of which Zealot is a member) are the females who are trained from birth to be warriors. The Pantheon and the Coda make up the government of Khera and are usually in opposition. The Pantheon prefers to ignore their violence-filled past and strive for intellectual and scientific advances. The <a href=\"/coda/65-40958/\"> Coda</a> feels they should always be ready for war and actively looking to conquer others. In both groups there are Lords, beings with vast psychic powers and the ability to control energy. The last group is the Shaper\u2019s Guild. Genetically they are not true Kherubim but they are not considered different by the other two groups. The Shapers are all like <a href=\"/warblade/29-12014/\"> Warblade</a>; they can turn their bodies into liquid metal, shape it, and harden it into various bladed weapons as well as create projectiles. They are the architects and engineers of Khera. There is also a whole population of sentient robots like <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\"> Spartan</a> that are used for personal protection. The Titanthropes, or Titans, are the original race of Khera. They live underground and are used for heavy labor. <a href=\"/maul/29-21968/\"> Maul</a> was a Titan-human hybrid. They are treated unfairly by the \u201ctrue\u201d Kherubim and not considered as good as even the human-Kherubim hybrids, but they are not as bad off as the Daemonites. After the war, all Daemonites were made slaves. They are the lowest of society and live in the hidden ghettos of Khera.</p><p>Every Kherubim is a member of one of 7 military factions. They are called factions like membership is a choice, but membership is decided when a Kherubim is born and is connected to the type of being each Kherubim is. Members of the Kherubim Pantheon are Warlords that lead other Kherubim into battle and thanks to their amazing abilities can handle the biggest threats on their own. Not all Pantheon members are Warlords, but all Warlords come from the Pantheon. Warlords all all have a <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\"> Superman</a> power set and they are the \"most highly evolved members of the Kheran nobility\". The normal Kherubim are split into two groups, the Coda and the Brotherhood of the Blade. The Coda, as mentioned, are all female and the Brotherhood are all male. Other than sex, the two groups are basically the same but the Coda has more political power. Some members of the Brotherhood have taken to splicing Shaper DNA into their own to give themselves similar metallic-blade powers. The Titans are all Titanthropes and are used for their brute strength and massive size. The Shapers Guild and the Spartan Guards don't change at all from how it is when they are not in war. The last faction is the Adrastea. They are like the normal Kherubim but they all have psychic powers (many are empaths). The group was originally a slave caste but became a powerful underground criminal organization.</p><p>In <a href=\"/majestic/49-18002/\"> Majestic</a>, Mr. Majestic's second solo series, the true history of Khera and the Kherubim was revealed. The original Kherubim came from somewhere else a long time ago and the Kherubim race that exists now are just copies, made and distributed through space thanks to <a href=\"/kherubim-technology/12-41622/\"> Kherubim Technology</a>. The first Kherubim created Planet-Shapers, massive terraforming machines that could be sent to suitable planets and through a long process, would rebuild the Kherubim race there. The Planet-Shapers would land on a still-forming planet and stay dormant beneath the mantle until sentient life evolved on the planet. At this point, the Planet-Shaper would release Kherubim (made inside the machine from \"pure Kherubim gene-stock\" it carried) and the natural sentient race of the planet would be made into a servitor race. To ensure that the new Kherubim flourished, the Planet-Shapers would restructure climate and geographic conditions to best suit the Kherubim. Also, giant robots would come from the Planet-Shapers and kill most of the servitor race, thinning down their numbers so they would never pose a threat to the new Kherubim. Sometimes the native sentient race was considered \"unusable or deviant\" and therefore had to be destroyed. The <a href=\"/daemonites/65-41061/\"> Daemonites</a> (the Kherubim's worst enemy) are just a slave species that were able to fight back, not actually evil creatures. The only people that know this secret history are <a href=\"/mr-majestic/29-21972/\"> Mr. Majestic</a>, <a href=\"/zealot/29-11586/\"> Zealot</a> and <a href=\"/helspont/29-40632/\"> Helspont</a>.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Keystone City is the city, in which the <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, the Fastest Man Alive, resides.</p><h2>Location, History, and Culture</h2><p>Like <a href=\"/gotham-city/34-23611/\">Gotham City</a> (home to <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>), <a href=\"/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a> (<a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>'s turf), and <a href=\"/star-city/34-47878/\">Star City</a> (<a href=\"/green-arrow/29-5936/\">Green Arrow</a>'s stomping grounds), Keystone City is home to a superhero - the Scarlet Speedster. However, it is different in a large way. Instead of being dark, like Gotham, or huge, like <a href=\"/metropolis/34-41184/\">Metropolis</a>, Keystone City is a small blue-collar town. Keystone City is in <a href=\"/kansas/34-55854/\">Kansas</a> on the Kansas-<a href=\"/missouri/34-55752/\">Missouri</a> border. Keystone City is approximately 35 miles north of Kansas City. The Missouri River separates Keystone City from its sister city, <a href=\"/central-city/34-54995/\">Central City</a>, Missouri.</p><p>Keystone City is near a few landmarks, such a<a href=\"/iron-heights/34-41410/\">s Iron Heights</a>. Iron Heights is a supervillain prison that is specially used for <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>'s villains.</p><p>After the Louisiana Purchase, a small settlement was created near the Missouri River in 1806. Following the Civil War. Keystone City became a supply center, as most business dealt with heavy industry. The transcontinental railroad through the city caused it to become a major transportation hub, from which the city could manufacture and distribute its industrial products. During World War II, the city retooled for the war effort, manufacturing aircraft and supplies for the huge war waged against the Axis.</p><p>Keystone City has been described as the blue-collar capital of America. \u201cKeystone City, the backbone of the Midwest. When the town was established in 1727, horseshoeing was the major occupation. Times change. Iron and steel forging, automobiles, coal, machinery tools, all of them come from this city.... The blue-collar capital of the U.S. and proud of it... It\u2019s a tough place, but a good place. With honest people who aren\u2019t afraid to get their hands dirty.\u201d This quote describes the place perfectly-it's a tough, friendly poor town full of hard-working people. Keystone is a huge center of manufacturing goods and supplies, too-supplies include iron, cars, and heavy machinery. The union is also huge, as the workers have combined to form one of the biggest unions in America.</p><h3>Flashes</h3><p>The first <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a>, was the first and longest staying in Keystone City. He was introduced in 1940, and was in Keystone from the start. He fought villains like <a href=\"/thinker/29-23851/\">Thinker</a>, <a href=\"/shade/29-9362/\">Shade</a>, <a href=\"/fiddler/29-6900/\">Fiddler</a>, and the especially evil <a href=\"/turtle/29-5721/\">Turtle</a>. Eventually, though, after ten years, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a> retired as Flash. This gave <a href=\"/turtle/29-5721/\">Turtle</a> an opportunity, and he built a criminal empire in Keystone that flourished for years. However, the third <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a> (<a href=\"/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a>) arrived and brought <a href=\"/turtle/29-5721/\">Turtle</a>'s empire down. Barry Allen and Bart Allen, the other two <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>es, never have resided in Keystone City.</p><h2>Continuity Crisis</h2><p>Originally, in Pre-Crisis history, <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a> lived and fought villains from his base residence in Keystone City before retiring at a historical period when comics started to fall out of popularity. But when DC introduced the Barry Allen <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>, starting the Silver Age, it was said that Allen lived in Central City-which had never been mentioned Pre-Crisis. DC's initial solution was oft-used before 1986--DC writers set Barry Allen's Central City on another Earth. It was noted that Keystone City was on Earth-2 with Garrick, while Central City was the Earth-1 home of Barry Allen. However, DC pulled all of the universes together in the universe-altering <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>, which bound all the universes together. DC covered the problem by making the two sister cities across from each other, while keeping each <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a> in his respective city.</p><p>Right now, the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> event has sucked both the <a href=\"/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>es that were in Keystone City into the <a href=\"/speed-force/12-42071/\">Speed Force</a>. What is Keystone's future without a Flash to protect them? We'll have to wait and see.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview&nbsp;</h2><p>Genosha used to be a hellish place on the Earth. It was nice for a short amount of time, and it was then reduced back to a hellish place. Only through a lot of work and perseverance will it stand tall-and it won't be easy.</p><h2>Genosha</h2><p>For most of Genosha's time, it was an island off the African coast. Its capital was Hammer Bay. At a glance, it seemed to be a good, prosperous nation. The standard of living was high and the citizens were well-treated. The economy was excellent and growing all the time. Political or racial turmoil was non-existent. Good things seemed to be happening in little Genosha. But all these things only applied for the humans of this small, inconspicuous, seemingly unimportant island nation.</p><p>In Genosha, the mutant population was enslaved. David Moreau, a scientist was known as the Genengineer. Anyone with the mutant gene was forced through a horrific treatment developed by the Genengineer. They were genetically modified and enhanced for their powers, and stripped of free will. They were treated like animals and given numbers, identified by those numbers. Their powers were changed to fit the needs of the economy. Then they were shipped off and worked as slaves until they died. No one was allowed in or out of Genosha. If you are a citizen, you will stay a citizen until you die. If you are not a citizen, then you're not getting in Genosha. The <a href=\"/genoshan-magistrates/65-25418/\">Magistrates</a> were a special police force that tracked down people who tried to escape and brought them back forcibly, and the Press Gang handled mutant problems. All in all, it was a horrible place.</p><p>The island of Genosha was often an enemy of the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> and other teams in the <a href=\"/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> (including <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a>, <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a>, and <a href=\"/generation-x/65-15083/\">Generation X</a>). Since mutants are horribly treated there, they often go to rescue the poor people, and Magistrates often attack them to bring them into Genosha, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, and <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> were kidnapped by Magistrates under the orders of the Genengineer and <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/29-13379/\">Cameron Hodge</a>. Hodge used to be an ally of X-Factor, but he became a mutant hater. They were rescued, though. Later, <a href=\"/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a> and <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> were kidnapped and going to brainwashed to be Genoshan \"citizens\". The X-Men freed their compatriots and toppled the Hodge and the Gengineer's regime. The new government promised kindness and humane treating of mutants, but spurred on by the <a href=\"/fabian-cortez/29-9728/\">Fabian Cortez</a>, Civil War broke out between the Mutates and Magistrate forces.</p><h2>Magneto's Regime and the Fall of Genosha</h2><p>After Cassasndra Nova's Attack</p><p>Playing on his reputation, <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> made his last blackmail attempt on the world threatening to destroy planetary EM field if he was not granted territory to create a mutant homeland. Despite the efforts of the X-Men to stop him, including the ultimate sacrifice of Magneto's clone <a href=\"/joseph/29-15063/\">Joseph</a>, the U.N. granted Magneto Genosha. The island nation had been torn apart by civil war between the Magistrate regime and the Mutate rebellion for months (perhaps years) and the U.N. hoped Magneto would be so bogged down in fighting this war, the Legacy Virus sweeping through the population, and Genosha's failed economy that he would never trouble the world again.</p><p>They were wrong. Within six months, Magneto had led the mutants and mutates to victory, and the Legacy Virus was cured. Magneto quickly rebuilt Genosha into a prosperous mutant paradise. Overconfident, Magneto declared war on humanity again. The X-Men snuck into Genosha to intervene and in the course of battle, Magneto's spine was severed by Wolverine. As Magneto's powers are dependent on his nervous system being intact, this not only left him paralyzed but unable to use his powers. This event would end up costing millions of lives.</p><p>In revenge for Xavier's mistreatment of her, <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a> found the last living relative of <a href=\"/bolivar-trask/29-15923/\">Bolivar Trask</a>, who had created the <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>. She then convinced him to give her control over the Sentinels. She sent them them to Genosha where they began wiping out the population. Depowered, Magneto was unable to stop them. The entire island was reduced to a pile of rubble, and all the progress was lost. 16 million people were killed, leaving perhaps a couple hundred survivors. Nova was eventually defeated by the X-Men back in New York, but the damage was done.</p><p>Magneto and <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> joined forces to reform Genosha, but their work was interrupted by the <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>'s nervous breakdown and the events of House of M. In the world of House of M, Geonsha was Magneto's seat of powers, and therefore the most prosperous nation in the world. However, when Wanda revered the world to normal, not only was Genosha restored to it's decimated state, but her entire mutant population, including its leader, was turned into normal humans. <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> eventually removed the last of the Genosha population for medical treatment, but Magneto remained. When they attempted to remove an unconscious Magneto from Genosha after his and the Avenger's encounter with the Collective, Magneto escaped. He has most recently been seen roaming the United States, seemingly depowered.</p><p>The most recent visitors to Genosha were Magneto's grandchildren: <a href=\"/wiccan/29-40505/\">Wiccan</a> and <a href=\"/speed/29-40518/\">Speed</a>, looking for their mother the Scarlet Witch. They encountered an empty land filled with destroyed towers and empty streets.</p><p>\"No one is here.\"</p><p>Whether Magneto retains legal possession of Genosha is unknown.</p><h2>Necrosha</h2><p>Selene's plans involve resurrecting the millions of dead mutants on the island and to make it the start of her kingdom.</p><h2>X-Factor Forever</h2><p>Through unknown means <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a> managed to convince <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">The Celestials</a> that Genosha was a threat to Mutantkind much like <a href=\"/deviants/65-13345/\">The Deviants</a> had been a threat to Humankind and so, like <a href=\"/lemuria/34-55791/\">Lemuria</a> before it, Genosha was obliterated by <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/29-32857/\">Arishem the Judge</a> and his Host. While much of its population managed to escape, not all of Genosha's inhabitants were fortunate enough to escape the wrath of their Celestial creators.</p><h2>Ultimate Genosha</h2><p>Ultimate Genosha is a small island south of Madagascar. It mostly does television programs, and the Ultimate versions of <a href=\"/longshot/29-6757/\">Longshot</a> and <a href=\"/mojo/29-6755/\">Mojo</a> live there. It seems to be crossed between Earth-616 Genosha and the Mojoworld, as mutants are only second-class citizens there.</p>",

According to one story, originally there was a void, Ginnungagap, bounded on either side by fire Muspelheim, the land of fire and Niflheim, the land of ice. When fire and ice met, they combined to form a giant named <a href=\"/ymir/29-10267/\">Ymir</a> and a cow named Audhumbla who nourished Ymir. She survived by licking the salty ice blocks. From her licking emerged <a href=\"/tiwaz/29-29073/\">Buri</a> who fathered <a href=\"/bor/29-58894/\">Bor</a> and through him the Asgardian race. Bor took the frost giant Bestia as his wife and fathered three children: <a href=\"/odin/29-3507/\">Odin</a>, Vili, and Ve. Bor is attributed with founding the city of Asgard and being its first king. The three brothers eventually slew Ymir and from his body made the Earth and humanity. After Bor's disappearance and the deaths of his brothers in battle with Surtur Odin became the sole ruler of the gods.</p><p>Another version states Asgard as it exist now only came into being about two thousand years ago. Every few thousand years Asgard is destroyed in Ragnarok only for a new Odin to form, rebuild the city and start the cycle anew with the gods living similar lives as they did before with slight differences. This cycle was perpetuated by mysterious beings called <a href=\"/those-who-sit-above-in-shadow/65-56155/\">Those Who Sit Above in Shadow</a> so they could feed off the energy released before being broken by Thor.</p><p>Another version given recently by Odin states when Odin and his brothers were children Bor took a seed from a dimensional rift and planted it in the ground creating the World Tree. It is unknown if this merely connected the nine worlds, created all of them including Asgard, or some combination.</p><p>Another version suggest the beings who became known as the Norse gods were formed from the \"godstuff\" scattered by <a href=\"/atum-the-god-eater/29-41842/\">Atum</a> the God-Eater after he slew the evil elder gods. This godstuff was shaped by early human perceptions which formed all modern pantheons. The gods then eventually travelled from Earth to the dimension that became known as Asgard.</p><p>Another version suggest the gods were originally tribes of mortals that somehow ascended to godhood and eventually moved to Asgard.</p><p>It is unknown to what extent any of these stories are true. It is possible several of them are true or bits and pieces from various ones from the true origin. It is also possible none of them are true.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1116869\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/59489/1116869-thor601.jpg\" title=\"Thor with Asgard in the background\"><img id=\"1116869\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/59489/1116869-thor601_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Thor with Asgard in the background\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Thor with Asgard in the background</div></div></div></div><p>Whatever the original beginnings, Odin's desire to lead Asgard led him to betray his father during a battle with frost giants. With Bor turned to snow then scattered by the winds and his brothers fallen in battle with Surtur, Odin became the High Father of Asgard. As the years passed, Odin's wisdom grew stronger and he sought to understand more of the universe beyond the nine worlds. His curiosity lead to war with the <a href=\"/dark-gods/65-23162/\">Dark Gods</a>, a pantheon of alien gods that were Asgard's opposite in ever way that mattered. War broke out between them and Asgard fell for the first time. After Thor aided his father in battle, Odin retook Asgard and banished the Dark Gods. Centuries passed and Asgard fell victim to Sutur of Muspelhiem, and in a final battle, Odin and Sutur were killed in battle and Asgard fell once again. However, they both returned alive and Odin return to rule the kingdom.</p><p>Odin learned of the cycle of Ragnarok and kept it secret from his people. At one point, the Egyptian god, Seth sought to destroy Asgard and with Thor lost in Onslaught, he saw it as the perfect time to claim Asgard and end the cycle to reshape the kingdom to his rule. However, the Asgardians rose and stopped Seth but in their weaken state, the Dark Gods returned and destroyed Asgard to reshape in their own image. Eventually, Thor returned and freed his people and Asgard returned to its wondrous state again. However, those times grew dark again as Surtur returned to Earth and Odin was once again lost and Thor took over as ruler. Thor moved Asgard to Earth and attempted to better life for all humans, but due to Resistance from without and treachery from within eventually subjugated the Earth to his rule. In time, he was force to face his crimes and returning to the past prevented that timeline from ever coming about. His actions during this caused the <a href=\"/the-odin-force/12-35070/\">Odinforce</a> to leave him making Asgard vulnerable. In was during this time that <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> started Ragnarok and sought to reshape Asgard in his own way. He devastated Asgard until Thor had discovered the truth and used the powers of the Rune Stones to end Loki's rule and break the endless cycle of Those who Sit above in Shadow for good.</p><h2>Attractions</h2><ul><li>Dome of Combat</li><li>Giant Bust of Odin</li><li>Hall of Heroes</li><li>Monument to the Unknown Warrior</li><li>Museum of Weaponry</li><li>Shopping Center</li><li>Temple of Titans</li><li>Warlock's Haven</li><li>Warrior's Walk</li><li>Yggasdral (Tree of Life) Monument</li></ul><h2>Post Destruction</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1051324\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38888/1051324-9027445_550_art_r0.jpg\" title=\"Fall of Asgard\"><img id=\"1051324\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38888/1051324-9027445_550_art_r0_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fall of Asgard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fall of Asgard</div></div></div></div><p>After the destruction of Asgard and the Civil War had concluded <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> returned from the dead.

In 1939,Loki, posing as Baron Zemo, made an alliance with the Frost Giants who laid siege to Asgard, intending to cause Ragnarok, the end of all things. Odin banished Loki to the room without doors, saving his life. The leader of the <a href=\"/frost-giants/65-57102/\">Frost Giants</a>, Mammoth killed Odin, Thor in despair over his fathers death and his brothers betrayal, used Mjolnir to destroy Asgard, along with the Frost Giants and the rest of the Asgardians. As he was confined to the room without doors, Loki was the only Asgardian god to survive the destruction of Asgard. Thor and Balder were reborn as humans on Earth in the late 20th century. During the events of Ultimate Comics: New Ultimates, Thor was killed, and reborn as an Asgardian, shortly after this in Ultimate Comics: Fallout, Asgard was recreated in the skies above Europe, as part of Odin's greater plan to remake two worlds, Asgard into what it once was, and Earth into what it can be. Asgard was destroyed in Ultimate Comics: Ultimates issue 2, by Reed Richards and the <a href=\"/children-of-tomorrow/65-58814/\">children of tomorrow</a>. Thor placed his son, along with Mjolnir in the room without doors to save his life, as Odin once did for Loki.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1467169\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39997/1467169-asgard.jpg\" title=\"Animated Asgard\"><img id=\"1467169\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39997/1467169-asgard_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Animated Asgard\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Animated Asgard</div></div></div></div><ul><li>Asgard appears in the <i>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</i> episode \"The Vengeance of Loki.\" Thor shows the Spider-Friends what Asgard is like.</li><li>Asgard is featured in <i>The Super Hero Squad Show</i>.

Post-war internationalism coupled with a fear of Communism's spread forced the American government to go to extreme measures to protect itself.  One of these measures was Science City Zero.</p><p>Located somewhere in the American Southwest, Science City Zero was a top-secret research installation.  Human subjects were brought in - usually political dissidents, reactionaries, vagrants, drinkers and, well, anyone who was generally disapproved of - and used to test the limits of biotechnology and the human body.</p><p>Subjects were rendered invisible, grown to giant sizes, had their brains replaced with energy fields, and resurrected from the dead, for starters.  The grounds were patrolled by atomic dogs and giant ants, and getting out was nearly impossible.</p><p>The lead scientist in Science City Zero was <a href=\"/randall-dowling/29-1821/\">Randall Dowling</a>, one of the greatest scientist of the time, who had an obsession with metahumans.  He was not one himself, but aspired to it, a personality flaw that would eventually make him one of the most powerful people on the planet.

Much of the equipment and research were left behind, but undiscovered until the site was investigated by <a href=\"/planetary/65-40401/\">Planetary</a> on a tip from a young woman named <a href=\"/allison/29-17597/\">Allison</a>, who had been a subject there.</p><p>Some subjects left Science City Zero alive, but changed.

This event was caused by <a href=\"/king-kamuu/29-36921/\">King Kamuu</a> when he tried to defend it from the Deviants of Lemuria by opening the city's magma pits.

Namor went to war with them, but the war was stopped as soon as it began when the Invisible Woman became its ruler.</p><h2>DC Comics</h2><p>DC's version of Atlantis first appeared in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/49-3105/\">Adventure Comics</a> vol 1 #260 in 1959.</p><p>In the DC universe, Atlantis is a the city under the sea ruled by <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a>.</p><h3><b>History</b></h3><p>The Kingdom of Atlantis is generally considered to be the earliest known civilization on Earth, existing as long as 1,000,000 years ago. How the Atlantean race of homo sapiens arose hundreds of thousands of years before the rise of current-day humanity is unknown, but this anomaly of evolution is believed to be linked to the strong presence of magical energy, or mana, that then existed around Earth.</p><p>The original Atlanteans were highly mystical beings; their society and the very structure of the world was based on the use of this magical energy. Over the millennia, the mana was eventually depleted, and the powers of science and technology replaced sorcery as the dominant force of nature.</p><p>While it flourished, Atlantis was a great civilization; it ruled the world through the power of its twelve major city-states, which were located on all the continents of Earth. Each of these city-states was ruled by a sorcerer-monarch who wielded the mystic power of his part of the world. At the head of the entire Atlantean Empire was the most powerful kings and queens. Less the master of the eleven other monarchs than a sort of chairman of the Royal Conclave of Twelve, this monarch also reigned over the first and largest of the Atlantean city-states, the magnificent City of the Golden Gate.</p><p>In its early years however, Atlantis was ruled by a body of mad sorcerers. These sorcerers were eventually wiped out and replaced by saner rulers who sought peace rather than the the endless warfare of their predecessors. Atlantis' first great era of peace and prosperity came during the reign of Calculha, about half a million years ago. To Calculha and his queen Majiestra were born two sons, Ahri'ahn and Garn. Majiestra was a student of the dark forces, and in seeking power, she stole the Twelve Crystals of the Zodiac, which were keyed to the magical nexi of the twelve major cities. To save Atlantis from her evil Ahri'ahn sacrificed himself. His soul was sent out into the stars in the form of pure magical energy, where it traveled for hundreds of thousands of years before being drawn back to Earth for its rebirth as Arion.</p><p>The Atlanteans grew in stature and power. Soon, their eyes turned to the world beyond Earth, leading them to begin an extensive study and survey of the universe. These efforts culminated in the creation of magically-fueled spacecraft, which carried hordes of Atlantean colonists out into interstellar space, they lost contact with Earth. Years later, it was learned that the farther they traveled away from Earth, the weaker the magic that propelled their ships became. The Atlanteans found refuge on an uninhabited world and created a civilization based on science. Technology-powered space flight was eventually rediscovered and the Atlanteans, having evolved along different biological and ethical paths, set out on a warlike conquest of neighboring worlds.</p><p>Although the Atlanteans were virtually the all-powerful masters of the world and their environment, they were confronted with certain insurmountable problems. Foremost among these problems was the disappearance of the magical mana. Also, the Atlanteans encountered a savage race of barbaric sub-men, Homo Erectus, which were the precursors to our own civilization. The people of Atlantis also shared the Earth with a variety of magical beings and creatures, as well as otherdimensional visitors from neighboring mystically-based realms.</p><p>As the magic waned, Atlantis' hold over the Earth began to weaken as all of the Atlanteans' energies were focused on maintaining their hold on existence. Cities built on magic crumbled, and the creatures of sorcerous origins lapsed into extinction and myth. Arion had returned during this era and attempted to gold his world together, but the forces of change were to great for even his magic, and the great civilization that was Atlantis crumbled.</p><p>The kingdom of Atlantis held on for several years after that, with Arion at it's helm, before the final fall and the Atlanteans' virtual extinction at the hands of the barbarous hordes of emerging mankind. Before this, Lord Norrad the Younger fled Atlantis with a small group of followers. They eventually sailed through the interdimensional nexus linking the Earth and Skartaris.</p><h3>Cities of Atlantis</h3><p>Atlantis has split into several different cities since its sinking. The main of these being <b>Poseidonis</b>, the domed city where <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a> is seen most often, but there are many more.</p><p><b>Poseidonis</b></p><p>The main city of Atlantis, it is a large domed city. <a href=\"/aquaman/29-2357/\">Aquaman</a> is seen here most often.

After being defeated in a one-on-one battle with Aquaman he swore to help protect Poseidonis as best he can.</p><p><b>Thierna Na Oge</b></p><p>A land of mystics that are ruled by a mystical Conclave.</p><p><b>Shayeris (formerly Crastnus)</b></p><p>The Capital of the Hidden Valley.

It's capital city was Haasenstadt.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />A young genius named <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">           Victor Von Doom</a>, a resident, waged a war with the monarchy with his incredible inventions. Von Doom left to be schooled in America and upon his return he slayed the King and imprisoned his son <a href=\"/prince-rudolfo/29-35539/\">         Rudolfo</a>. Doom created a robot of Rudolfo that surrendered the crown to him before the people. Doom also created a puppet prime minister and remained anonymous for many years as ruler to the outside world. He changed the capital to Doomstadt.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The country was taken over by Rudolfo in a coup. He impersonated Doom on the throne, only to have the <a href=\"/red-skull/29-2250/\">      Red Skull</a> assassinate him and take control of the country. Doom returned and forced Red Skull out, taking his rightful place as ruler.<br />&nbsp;<br />The country was briefly ruled by <a href=\"/zorba/29-34454/\">        Prince Zorba</a>, the younger brother of <a href=\"/prince-rudolfo/29-35539/\">   Rudolfo</a>, when Doom fell into madness. The country went into a state of civil war. Once Doom recovered, he killed <a href=\"/zorba/29-34454/\">    Zorba </a>and took back leadership of the country. <br /><br />Latveria was recently annihilated by Doctor Doom's former Master, <a href=\"/the-marquis-of-death/29-59172/\">          The Marquis of Death</a>.

After \"The End\" has appeared, Von Doom's incarcerated body is shown on board a ship bound for Latveria. Also during the scene where he first dons his trademark metal mask, a plaque can be seen declaring it as a gift to Doom from the people of Latveria. In the sequel, Doom is reawakened in his castle by the Silver Surfer's passage through Latveria.<br /><br />\n<h3> Video games</h3>\n<ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>In the 1980s computer game <i> </i><i>Accolade's Comics</i> the protagonist Steve Keene is offered tickets to the Latverian Ballet.</li><li>In <i> </i><i>Spider-Man: The Game</i>, a billboard can be seen in the first level advertising tourism in Latvania, a misspelling of Latveria.</li><li>Latveria is referred to in the <i> </i><i>Spider-Man 2</i> video game when  J.

It is the fourth planet of thirty-seven revolving around the star Deneb. The planet rotates faster than Earth causing shorter days.<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Religion<br /></h2>&nbsp;In the distant past the Zenn-Lavians worshiped several pantheons of gods that are now known as the <a href=\"/old-gods-of-zenn-la/65-57918/\">   Old Gods of Zenn-La</a>.&nbsp; <a href=\"/thrann/29-74519/\">  Thrann</a>, the Saint of Science taught them to embrace science ironically bringing an end to the worship of the gods despite their attempt to reconnect.&nbsp; The Zenn-Lavians turning their backs on the gods led the gods to turn their backs on them even in the face of disaster.<br /><br /><h2>History</h2> <h3>From Chaos to Enlightenment</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873159\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873159-norrin_konn_super.jpg\" title=\"Norrin Konn - Father of Zenn-La\"><img id=\"873159\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873159-norrin_konn_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Norrin Konn - Father of Zenn-La\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Norrin Konn - Father of Zenn-La</div></div></div></div>Originally, <a href=\"/zenn-lavians/65-57886/\">    Zenn-Lavians</a> were full of lust and hate. Once some realized that they would eventually exterminate themselves in a few generations, they turned to science.&nbsp; The god <a href=\"/thrann/29-74519/\"> Thrann </a>is credited with bringing about this change.&nbsp; Some would not follow the path of the rationality and logic and civil war broke out on the planet. The technological side was led by <a href=\"/norrin-konn/29-77391/\">Norrin Konn</a> and the people that wished to follow the old ways was led by a female <a href=\"/warlord-of-zenn-la/29-63415/\">             Warlord</a>. The Warlord was eventually defeated and Zenn-La came to be in a technological, enlightened era.<br /><br />Zenn-La became a supremely technologically advanced world. Marvels in science made it so no Zenn-Lavian need ever dirty their hands. Everything was controlled by computers and robots. Zenn-Lavians had a peaceful utopia with no need for war or violence. Before this time though, Zenn-Lavians waged war on each other for ten thousand centuries, as do most civilizations. This ended and the Zenn-Lavians began to explore space but eventually their technology advanced so much that this became an old practice.<br /><br />This advanced society became bored with having nothing to do. Some people resorted to drugs to send them into mind-altering adventures. Others used psycho-recreational arts, a form of leisure device that transfers dreams into one's mind. Others still could not bare this type of life and committed suicide. Some believed the the advances in science were wasting the people away from their prior greatness.<br /><br />When Galactus' spaceship approached the planet, the Zenn-Lavians being a peaceful race they were defenseless. The people panicked, and in desperation they used a museum piece, the last remaining weapon on Zenn-La. They called it the Supreme Weapon and fired it at the ship. It was so destructive it knocked nearby planets from their orbits and created worldwide destruction. Zenn-La itself only survived because of it's force field. Zenn-La was to be consumed by <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">             Galactus</a> but Norrin Radd gave himself to the being in exchange for the safety of his people. He thus became the <a href=\"/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">             Silver Surfer</a>.<br /><br /><h3>Destruction and Rebirth</h3>When the Surfer rebelled against his master he imprisoned him on Earth and returned to Zenn-La, consuming it's energy. In a rare moment, Galactus gave the residents of the planet 24 hours to escape. The planet was left barren but the Zenn-Lavians survived. After the heat and smoke settled, they returned and created large camps to live in. The planet remained barren with only weeds growing from the soil. <br /><br />When <a href=\"/mephisto/29-2635/\">             Mephisto</a> brought <a href=\"/shalla-bal/29-7125/\">             Shalla Bal</a>, Norrin's long lost love, to Earth only to take her away to torment the Surfer he was able to give her some of his <a href=\"/power-cosmic/12-41039/\">             Power Cosmic</a>. With this power she was able to start growth on the dead planet wherever she stepped foot. Because of this power she was named Empress of Zenn-La. They began to rebuild and with their technologic expertise they were able to quickly rebuilt their society.<br /><br /><h3>Kree-Skrull War</h3>Zenn-La was threatened to be in the middle of the Second Kree-Skrull War. When the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">             Skrulls </a>approached the planet to make it an ally the Silver Surfer turned them away. He vowed to Shall Bal to be protector of the planet. When the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">             Kree </a>came to recruit them the Surfer destroyed their ships. Later in a meeting with <a href=\"/nenora/29-56642/\">             Nenora</a>, Supreme Leader of the Kree Empire, she agreed to leave the planet out of the war.<br /><br />After helping to save Galactus' life from the <a href=\"/elders-of-the-universe/65-41142/\">             Elders of the Universe</a>, Galactus has agreed to never devour Zenn-La ever again.<br /><br />The planet's population was then attacked by the <a href=\"/obliterator/29-45074/\">             Obliterator</a>, who decimated the population. He threatened to destroy the entire planet. Silver Surfer managed to lure him away.<br /><br />The planet was again attacked by the Kree Empire after a misunderstanding between Supreme Leader Nenora and the Silver Surfer. Zenn-La allies with the Skrulls against the common enemy. Again, the Surfer managed to persuade her to leave the planet out of the war. She tells him though that the empire will hunt him wherever he goes and he is not to return to the planet. By the end of the war, the Surfer had no obligations to hold up this agreement. With the Kree defeated, the Empress witnessed the truce between the waring races. But this was only temporary and the planet was still at risk. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>The Enslavers </h3>The entire race of the Zenn-Lavians was captured by the <a href=\"/enslavers/65-56863/\">            Enslavers</a>, and they left no trace of what happened. The Silver Surfer consulted <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">           Mr. Fantastic</a> on Earth and decided he should search harder. He was eventually led to the Enslavers ship and their ruler <a href=\"/mrrungo-mu/29-64819/\">          Mrrungo-Mu</a>. He was able to defeat Mrrungo and free all of his captors, including the Zenn-Lavians. Along with Shalla Bal, he returned them back to their planet.<br /><br /><h3>&nbsp;A Chance for Peace</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873182\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873182-great_one_on_zenn_la_super.jpg\" title=\"The Great One\"><img id=\"873182\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873182-great_one_on_zenn_la_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Great One\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Great One</div></div></div></div>Zenn-La was then met by the <a href=\"/great-one/29-42978/\">             Great One</a>, who preserved worlds in his own mind. He gave the people the choice to leave the universe behind and be protected forever. They unanimously voted to stay with the Great One. Inside his mind, all Zenn-Lavians were made immortal and lived&nbsp; peaceful, happy lives. The Silver Surfer even returned with the help of <a href=\"/moondragon/29-7214/\">             Moondragon </a>and lived in peace for the first time since meeting Galactus. But out of fear, the Great One attacked him and received a mortal wound. If he were to die then so would Zenn-La. With the help of Moondragon, he was able to rescue the planet from destruction, but not before losing Empress Shalla Bal in the process. The citizens blamed the loss of both the Great One's protection and their Empress on the Silver Surfer.<br /><br /><h3>Return of the Empress</h3>With the help of Adam Warlock, the Silver Surfer was able to resurrect Shalla and she once again returned to be the Empress of Zenn-La. It was here that she met <a href=\"/fennan-radd/29-7127/\">             Fennan Radd</a> and formed a relationship with him. He believed the people to be falling into irresponsibility and laziness due to the level of advancement their society had achieved and their Silver Surfer worship. <br />&nbsp;<br /><h3>All An Illusion </h3>The Silver Surfer was alerted that their was trouble on Zenn-La and rushed there to see the planet falling apart. The current <a href=\"/genis-vell/29-4813/\">      Captain Marvel</a> was trying to stop the source, but the Surfer stopped him. They watched as the planet just evaporated into thin air. The Surfer lost his emotions and certain memories after this. <br />&nbsp;<br />The Surfer went back in time to unlock his emotions and memories and discovered the truth. Zenn-La was destroyed in the Earth year 1947 by <a href=\"/the-other/65-56848/\">     The Other</a>. Galactus knew one day his herald would leave him and return home, so he created an illusion so lifelike that no one would ever know.<br /> <b><br /></b><h2>Zenn-Lavian People</h2><b>Origin Galaxy:</b> Milky Way<br /><b>Star System:</b> Deneb<br /><b>Planet:</b> Zenn-La, 4th from the sun<br /><b>Estimated Population:</b> 500<br /><b>Physical Characteristics:</b><br /><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Type:</b> Humanoid</li><li><b>Eyes: </b>Two</li><li><b>Fingers:</b> Five, with opposable thumb</li><li><b>Toes:</b> Five</li><li><b>Skin Color: </b>Pink</li><li><b>Average Height:</b> 6'0''</li></ul><b>Special Adaptations:</b> Zenn-Lavians have average lifespans of thousands of years<br /><b>Level of Technology:</b> Advanced<br /><b>Type of Government: </b>Utopia<br /><b>Names of Representatives: </b><a href=\"/yarro-gort/29-14620/\">             Yarro Gort</a>, <a href=\"/norrin-konn/29-77391/\">Norrin Konn</a>, <a href=\"/elmar-radd/29-59878/\">             Elmar Radd</a>, <a href=\"/jartran-radd/29-57409/\">             Jartran Radd</a>, <a href=\"/fennan-radd/29-7127/\">             Fennan Radd</a>, <a href=\"/shalla-bal/29-7125/\">             Shalla Bal</a>, <a href=\"/warlord-of-zenn-la/29-63415/\">             Warlord</a>, <a href=\"/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">             Norrin Radd</a>, Anddar Bal <br />&nbsp;<br />Called Zenn-Lans in some later stories.<br /><br /><h2>Places of Interest</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"873151\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873151-zenn_la_city_super.jpg\" title=\"Zenn-La City\"><img id=\"873151\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/873151-zenn_la_city_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Zenn-La City\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zenn-La City</div></div></div></div>The City of Zenn-La - The first city to give itself over to technology before the civil war.
