        "description":"The Kherubim are a race of aliens from the planet <a href=\"/khera/34-40910/\">Khera</a> and have an understanding of science that has allowed them to invent amazing technology. <br /><br /><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Technology on Khera</h2><span>Because the technology comes from <a href=\"/khera/34-40910/\">Khera</a>, some of the greatest examples of what the Kherubim have created is there, but since the planet has only been in the comics for one arc, there aren't many. When the <a href=\"/wildcats/65-25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a> visited the planet and couldn't speak the language, they were given patches that would allow them to instantly learn it. Language is encoded onto molecules on the patches so when they adhere to the skin, knowledge (of language in this case) can be transmitted through the blood to the brain. Locations all over Khera displayed creative uses for Kherubim technology. The WildC.A.T.s stayed at a place called Coincidental Mansion which demonstrated Kherubim technology capable of directly altering probability and chance for entertainment purposes. In the entire area in and around the mansion, bizarre and improbable happenings were more likely to take place thanks to a \"low probability field generator\". While the other WildC.A.T.s stayed at the Mansion, <a href=\"/zealot/29-11586/\">Zealot</a>, as leader of the <a href=\"/coda/65-40958/\">Coda</a>, stayed somewhere else. The base for the Coda was built in a desert called the Bay of Numbers. In the Bay, the grains of sand continually shaped and reshaped themselves into ever-changing geometric forms. Perfect spheres, cubes and other, seemingly random shapes would form out of the sand, but the order and placement of them never repeated (and never would for all eternity). Though Coincidental Mansion and the Bay of Numbers were just for decoration and entertainment, there are other Kherubim creations that serve more practical purposes. The most noticeble piece of Kherubim technology are the Spartan Guards. The Spartans are fully sentient robots that are built as personal bodyguards as well as a police force. Each Spartan has a \"brain\" more powerful than any other computer (on Earth or otherwise), is programmed to be able to use any technology it comes across, is equipped with powerful lasers, is skilled in armed and unarmed combat and has superhuman levels of strength, speed and durability. <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\">Spartan</a>, one of these androids, is a permanent member of the WildC.A.T.s and also shows up in several other comics. In the Majestic one-shot: <a href=\"/wildstorm-spotlight-majestic/49-18001/\">Wildstorm Spotlight: Majestic</a>, he gets so advanced that he becomes a god, a powerful example of the limits (or lack thereof) of Kherubim technology. Of all the Kherubim creations though, the Kheran Dream Engine may be the best. It can warp reality to make thoughts and dreams real.<br /><br /></span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Space Travel</h2><span>The Kherubim have ships built (or more accurately \"grown\") for interstellar flight and in some cases, faster than light travel. Most Kherubim ships are able to access and travel <a href=\"/the-bleed/34-41042/\">The Bleed</a>, allowing them to visit other dimensions. These ships (and the other battle ships) are outfitted with some of Khera's best weaponry and are so massive, they could be considered small cities. Even with the speeds the ships can reach, travel can still take a long time depending on the destination or purpose of the trip so stasis pods are on the ships to allow the crew to store their bodies safely during travel. While in stasis, the mind of a sleeping Kherubim is stored in a crystal should anything happen to them. Upon reaching their destination, the mind is returned to the brain and body it came from. If something should happen to the body during flight, the crystal can be stored until a new body can be made for the mind to be put into. (This was actually what happened with <a href=\"/majestrate/29-40691/\">Majestrate</a>.) Kheran ships have a unique control system that is operated by vocalizations. Kherans sing to their ships to get them to do what they want and the Kheran vocal range is different enough from other species (at least human and Daemonite) that they can't be piloted by non-kherans without extensive modification.<br /><br /></span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Weapons</h2><span>Though the Kherubim have awesome technology and a myriad of machines that can do their fighting for them, most choose to fight for themselves and use bladed weapons to do so. Just because the weapons are not as complex as guns and lasers though, doesn't mean they aren't as effecient as other Kherubim tools. Blades made by Kherubim technology (called Kusar Blades) are capable of cutting anything, even beings of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>/<a href=\"/mr-majestic/29-21972/\">Mr. Majestic</a> level durability. Sentient swords have been created that can deliver energy blasts as they strike (if the sword deems it necessary) as well as perform other tasks in the hands of a skilled swordsman. A sword like this is not common though, and only the highest ranking and most deserving are given weapons like this. Majestic owns another special blade that hasn't been seen before. It is a large sword capable of changing its shape (even changing from a blade to a completely different weapon like a spiked ball and chain) and also releasing energy blasts and electrical charges. The fluid way that the sword changes shapes suggests that it might have been created through study of the Shaper's Guild. There are also special weapons for stealth combat. Quantum-Folded Combat Blades are invisible and can be shrunk to the size of a cell phone and enlarged for combat. Skintight Nanoflage suits make the wearer invisible to all forms of surveillance and High-Dose Damper Capsules are pills that remove the powers of whoever ingests them so their energy signature is also undetectable.</span><span><br /><br />All this is not to say that Kherubim don't have other, more complex weapons. The Kherubim have energy weapons, forcefield technology, genetic bombs and weapons created for large-scale warfare and world take-overs, it's just that they are rarely needed since the Kherubim themselves are war machines. One weapon that Kherubim possess is the Low-Grav Wallcrawler. It most resembles a normal Earth tank (with more cannons) but it can transform into an even bigger machine almost capable of going head to head with a Spartan Guard. These machines appear to be semi-sentient, able to be piloted or left to act on their own. The Kherubim also have bio-chemical weapons, one of which is the Haikyatu Armory. According to <a href=\"/emp/29-21970/\">Emp</a> it has two stages. The first is a bacteria bomb that destroys the nerve centers of all forms of life while keeping the bodies intact. The second stage reanimates and controls the bodies, creating an army of undead. Of course there are also the lasers and mega-bombs that most advanced races seem to have, but the Kherubim try not to totally destroy their enemies when they fight in case something can be gained from keeping them alive.<br /><br /></span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Planet-Shapers</h2><span>Planet-Shapers are massive machines used for the colonization of new planets and the spread of Kherubim. The first Kherubim created Planet-Shapers, terraforming machines that could be sent to suitable planets and through a long process, would rebuild the Kherubim race there. The Planet-Shapers would land on a still-forming planet and stay dormant beneath the mantle until sentient life evolved on the planet. At this point, the Planet-Shaper would release Kherubim (made inside the machine from \"pure Kherubim gene-stock\" it carried) and the natural sentient race of the planet would be made into a servitor race. To ensure that the new Kherubim flourished, the Planet-Shapers would restructure climate and geographic conditions to best suit the Kherubim. Also, giant robots would come from the Planet-Shapers and kill most of the servitor race, thinning down their numbers so they would never pose a threat to the new Kherubim.<br />&nbsp;</span><span><a></a></span><a></a><h2>Kherubim Technology on Earth</h2><span>The Kherubim have been on Earth for thousands of years and as a result, a lot of their technology has mixed with human technology. In the <a href=\"/majestic/49-18002/\">Majestic</a> series, <a href=\"/desmond/29-40665/\">Desmond</a>, a child genius, reverse-engineered a lot of Kherubim technology for personal use. He made suits that let him act like a superhero and rebuilt his legs so he could walk (he had been paralyzed from the waist down). After he gave up being a superhero he started to use the Kherubim technology for commercial profit. He started a company and created the Quickthink 4-Tell, a phone with instant messaging, video and holo-still, internet access, mp3, voice actuation, 4-D surround playback, simulcast conference capabilities and more for less than 100 dollars. He became a millionaire and he wasn't the only one. <a href=\"/spartan/29-12006/\">Spartan</a>, a member of the <a href=\"/wildcats/65-25113/\">WildC.A.T.s</a>, used a mixture of Kherubim technology and <a href=\"/otherspace/34-41058/\">Otherspace</a> energy to in his own corporation. They sold batteries that lasted forever, cars that didn't need gas (and lasted forever) and computers that would never need to be upgraded or even plugged in. Other companies also used bits and pieces of Kherubim technology (though they didn't know it) and soon enough Earth was covered in \"xenotechnology\". In Wildcats v4, the latest volume, Spartan has begun to sell Spartan Guards as household tools and the world is eating them up.</span>",

The attack allows Wolverine to reach speeds much faster than he ever could on his own, causing him to do much more damage when he enters the battlefield. It also allows him get to areas that he couldn't before, such as extreme heights or distances. In the move, Colossus holds Wolverine in his hands and throws him with as much force as he can muster. Sometimes the throw is like a javelin and other times it looks like a baseball pitch, but the result is the same. The size difference between the two heroes involved makes this move easier than when it is tried with others. Colossus is very big so a small Wolverine fits right in his hand.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"88984\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88984-34641-fastball-special_super.jpg\" title=\"It's all in the arm\"><img id=\"88984\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/88984-34641-fastball-special_medium.jpg\" alt=\"It's all in the arm\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">It's all in the arm</div></div></div></div><p>Though Colossus and Wolverine are known for the maneuver, it can work with almost any duo physically capable.

This is because the Speed Force is used mostly by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a>'s throughout <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC</a> history and these are their symbols and colors. The Speed Force is sometimes referred to as the source of all speed, but it is sometimes imagined as a sort of location or dimension. All DC characters who are called speedsters are connected to the Speed Force regardless of the origin of their powers; it is said that when they die, speedsters become one with the Speed Force, something of a Valhalla for speedsters.</p><p>Not all DC <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/metahuman/12-55705/\">super-humans</a> with super speed are connected to the Speed Force, just the ones whose primary power is superhuman speed. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman,</a> though he is very fast, has no connection to the Speed Force. The same holds true for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lanterns</a>, who can traverse the galaxy at incredible speeds. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/max-mercury/29-2379/\">Max Mercury</a> discovered that it is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barry-allen/29-22804/\">Barry Allen</a> himself who generates the Speed Force with every step that he runs. When he was struck by the bolt of lightning that gave him his powers, the Speed Force was created and echoed through time and every dimension.

When he died his spirit merged with the Speed Force even though it was also seen in Heaven. After Bart returned to Earth so that he could absorb the Speed Force, Barry gave his grandson his costume, choosing to remain within the Force. Professor Zoom, however, sensed his old enemy's return and sent a subliminal pulse into the Speed Force to reawaken Barry's self awareness and bring him back to the physical world so he could engineer his revenge.</li><li>The second Kid Flash and fourth Flash, <a href=\"/bart-allen/29-1680/\">Bart Allen</a>'s powers came from the Speed Force, and at one time he wished to lose this connection, fearing the Speed Force. This was because during Infinite Crisis he was brought into the Speed Force where he aged four years and returned, only to absorb the Speed Force into himself, claiming it was gone. Recently he has been de-aged and become Kid Flash again.</li><li>The first Flash <a href=\"/jay-garrick/29-2395/\">Jay Garrick</a>, originally couldn't even run at the speed of sound until he met Barry Allen and began to tap into the Speed Force. He could then run 20 times as fast. Despite this he was unable to keep up with the many speedsters when they entered the Speed Force to entrap Superboy-Prime and when Bart returned and absorbed the Speed Force, Jay's powers began to swiftly diminish. Eventually however, when Bart apparently met his demise, Jay's powers have returned to their full strength.</li><li><a href=\"/johnny-quick/29-36717/\">Johnny Quick</a>, to save his daughter's life, ran into the Speed Force, and merged with it.

He was guardian to Bart Allen who had arrived from the future and understands the Speed Force probably better than anyone else. He could converse with spirits of those trapped in the Speed Force through meditation and ended up trapped there until Barry Allen brought him back.</li><li><a href=\"/reverse-flash/29-83879/\">Reverse-Flash</a> was sucked into the Speed Force and there he went insane after remaining there for 50 years. When he returned he wreaked havoc and eventually became a being of pure speed energy who has possessed the body of Max Mercury, thus condemning Max to the Speed Force.</li><li><a href=\"/savitar/29-48688/\">Savitar</a> developed powers from the Speed Force other speedsters had not, creating a cult based around himself. He murdered people in order to gain speed until Wally West forced him into the Speed Force. Shortly after Barry Allen returned from the Speed Force, Savitar used Barry as a doorway to engineer his own escape; however, Barry's touch caused Savitar to be consumed by the Negative Speed Force that Professor Zoom had infected Barry with.</li><li><a href=\"/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a>, the third Flash, his powers were connected to the Speed Force, a dimension he chose to live in during Infinite Crisis.

At first she and her twin brother Jai West shared a connection to the Speed Force and them fighting over it caused them to manifest unconventional powers for speedsters. During Flash: Rebirth she severed Jai's connection to the Speed Force and gained the full connection gaining traditional super speed and choosing to call herself Impulse.

Professor Zoom himself is the engine that generates this Negative Speed Force with every step that he runs. He used it to infect Barry Allen in the hopes that the Negative Speed Force would consume Barry's loved ones and other speedsters who rely on it, consuming Barry in grief so that he'd merge with the Speed Force.

They are usually referred to in terms of different barriers: The Sound barrier, Light barrier, Time Barrier, Dimensional Barrier, and finally the Speed Force Barrier. It introduced several \"new\" powers to Flash and other Speed Force-powered persons. Some of these powers had previously existed during the DC <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a>, but were later explained as manifestations of the Speed Force.</p><p>The Speed Force can be used to various effect including limited to time travel, faster-than-light travel, speed duplicates, constructs using Speed Force energy, faster healing and speed stealing or lending. It also provides speedsters the ability to function at unnatural speeds without the laws of physics stopping them. Those within the Speed Force are protected heat or bearing the brunt of impacts at any speed they travel. It also lets them breathe, receive stimuli (sight, hearing, etc.), and avoid completely destroying themselves and the world around them as they move. It can even be used to hold enemies indefinitely.</p><p>Here is a list of abilities granted by the Speed Force:</p><ul><li><b>Infinite Mass Punch</b> - When The Flash begins traveling near light speed he gains the relative mass of such a great speed allowing him to strike with blows with the force of \"a white dwarf star.\"</li></ul><ul><li><b>Speed Lend/Steal</b> - His most useful new power, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wally-west/29-23879/\">Wally West</a> could \"rob\" objects of their kinetic energy and , for example, stop bullets in flight or convert a supervillain to a statue and use the \"stolen\" kinetic energy to accelerate his movement. He could similarly lend his speed to objects or allies, enabling them to temporarily travel almost as fast as himself.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Accelerated Healing</b> - Using the Speed Force to accelerate his healing factor, Wally West could heal from deadly injuries, without aging. While he was in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League Of America</a>, Wally could use this power to heal his other team members by accelerating their healing factors without aging them.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Constructs</b> - Wally West made the discovery that if he concentrated he could create solid energy constructs using the Speed Force. He has used this ability to protect against disease, create pockets for holding items, and to compose a bullet-proof costume.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Shield</b> - Exhibited by Savitar, whose Speed Force mastery allows him to reflect objects away from himself.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Flight</b> - Exhibited by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/johnny-quick/29-5695/\">Johnny Quick</a> and his daughter Jesse Quick.</li></ul><ul><li><b>ESP</b> - Used by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/max-mercury/29-2379/\">Max Mercury</a>, whose strong connection with the Speed Force allows him to detect the motion of any object around the world and also to perceive another speedsters. Wally West also exhibited a this ability to perceive Linda across time and space.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Total Recall</b> - Bart Allen as the Flash used this ability to remember everything he reads using his super-speed. He is the only speedster to show this ability.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Speed Scouts</b> - The only speedster to use this ability, Bart Allen can create duplicates of himself using the Speed Force that, using the Speed Force's timeless nature, can travel forwards and backwards through time, manipulating objects or merging their consciousness with Bart's, informing him of their actions. Once, when a Speed Scout was killed, Bart fell into a coma and has never used this ability since.</li></ul>",

Upon discovery of the <a href=\"/terrigen-crystals/18-55807/\">  Terrigen Crystals</a> which produce the mists, Randac exposed himself to the vapors they created giving him immense psychic abilities.  Randac wanted exposure to the Mists to be mandatory in Inhuman culture.  The results were often disastrous.  Many mutated into deformed monsters.  Others mutated into an to an offshoot race of the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\"> Inhumans</a>, the <a href=\"/alpha-primitives/12-23691/\">   Alpha Primitives</a>.  Alpha Primitives are mules of Inhuman society: sterile, stupid, and barely functional other than the menial tasks of keeping the machinery that runs the Inhuman city of <a href=\"/attilan/34-44155/\">   Attilan</a> running smoothly.  Because of the problems with Terrigenesis, the Genetic Council was charged with the task of managing Terrigenesis to ensure that Inhumans are genetically compatible with the process before exposure.<br /><br />Terrigenesis creates seemingly random mutations in those exposed, unlocking their genetic potential.  Each Inhuman responds to the process differently and varies in both appearance and powers gained.  Terrigenesis has become such a key aspect of Inhuman culture that it is considered sacred.  Much of the Inhuman religion and culture is centered around Terrigenesis.  It is considered a rite of passage for Inhuman children.  Upon reaching a certain age, children are put into classes where they are paired up with other children of the same age to learn about Inhuman society, religious tradition, and culture.  Graduation is in the form of the Terrigenesis, and is an important moment for both the individual and the entire family.  Mutations that are key to Inhuman society may be a cause for celebration for the entire race.</p><a> </a><h2>Exposure</h2><p>The process of Terrigenesis can be extremely dangerous despite rigorous control on the part of the Genetic Council.  Mutations very greatly in function and level of power.  Mutations vary in every way imaginable including energy forms, psychic mutations, plant and animal control, sonic control, healing, death, strength, blast powers, flying, elemental manipulation, mutation enhancement, and much much more.  Some of the least powerful Inhumans can do little more than change skin pigment.  Some of the more powerful can level mountains, kill with a gaze, or more.</p><p>The unlocking of genetic potential that occurs in Inhumans during Terrigenesis seems to be random in nature, based on the genetic code of the individual alone.  It has been revealed that through Terrigenesis Inhumans fulfill a greater destiny through Terrigenesis.  When viewed from a higher level, it is evident that Terrigenesis is not only to enhance the individual, but to adapt for the benefit of society in preparation of the future.  When an Inhuman with a mutation that is key to Inhuman society dies a replacement mutation occurs within a matter of three years.  Times of strife or conflict, or times of great climate change will facilitate mutations appropriate to the circumstances.</p><a> </a><h2>Compatibility</h2><p>Exposure by those who are not genetically compatible with Terrigenesis can be dangerous for those involved.  Disastrous mutations can occur and in some rare instances exposure can cause one to cease to exist (even if genetically compatible).  Exposure by humans results in Inhuman-like mutations, but the powers and abilities gained as well as the test subject do not last long.  The body rapidly begins to burn out and deteriorate.  This begins with rapid onset of some of the features of old age, and in later stages will leave little more than a corpse-like husk.  Death is imminent.</p><p>Exposure to human <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">   Mutant</a> can result in the further development of their powers, but at a high price.  After <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\">   M-Day</a> several de-powered mutants were exposed to the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">   Terrigen Mists</a>, resulting in the re-gaining of their mutant abilities at a level which they had never experienced before.  Some of the enhanced mutations recorded in mutants (or former mutants) are:<br /></p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/unus/29-3438/\">   Unus</a> regained his force field, but was suffocated by it as it no longer let oxygen through.<br /></li><li><a href=\"/freakshow/29-4994/\">   Freakshow</a> regained his shape-shifting abilities, but was stuck in the form of a giant disfigured monster with no way to communicate.<br /></li><li><a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">   Callisto</a>'s senses were heightened to the point where she was put in a coma from the sensation of raindrops on her skin.</li><li><a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">   Quicksilver</a> regained the ability to speed up his body to the point where he could jump from one time to another.</li><li><a href=\"/wicked/29-3425/\">   Wicked</a> regained her ability to summon the spirits of the dead, but could no longer control them.&nbsp; These spirits began to torment her. <br /></li></ul><p>Secondary exposure of Inhumans is also extremely dangerous, and leads to further mutation.  <a href=\"/gorgon/29-4330/\">   Gorgon</a> was exposed to the mists a second time by the United States government when they captured the Terrigen Crystals causing him to mutate into a large beast.  The effect on his powers have yet to be seen.</p><a> </a><h2>Related Topics</h2><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">Terrigen Mists</a></li><li><a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a></li></ul>",

Its even powerful enough to stop a healing factor and when Wolverine had <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky</a> use Carbonadium bullets, a single one was enough to stop his son <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daken/29-42501/\">Daken</a> from recovering.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n<p>A possible way to survive the ill affect is to drain life energies as Omega Red does or use a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carbonadium-synthesizer/18-42385/\">Carbonadium Synthesizer</a>, which can melt Carbonadium and also work to \"clean\" it. This device was lost during WWII, with Wolverine having one of the few last ones. Even if someone is capable of obtaining one, the process is also a complicated and dedicated measurement, one which would require the mind of a person of the level of intelligence of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>.</p>\n<p>It is suspected by some readers, the unknown catalyst which helped create the compound comprising <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-americas-shield/18-50737/\">Captain America's shield</a>, could be carbonadium.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><br /></p>",
