        "description":"<p>Physics Professor Martin Stein's dream was to create a fully automated, self-sustaining nuclear power plant.  After years of hard work and dedication, he was about to achieve his lifelong goal.  The night before the plant was to go online, a group of nuclear protesters broke in, planted dynamite, and knocked Stein unconscious before he could stop them.  Unknown to him, his former assistant, Dr. Danton Black, was also in the Plant the night before its opening.  His intentions were far from noble, however, as he was simply covering up the fact that he had been stealing Stein's designs for the Plant (though Martin had fired him upon firing out, Black was never turned in to the authorities, and he had accused Martin of stealing the plant designs from him).  When the dynamite went off and exposed three men (Stein, Black, and a high school student caught up in the protest, Ronnie Raymond) to a wave of nuclear radiation, they were all instantly affected.  Ronnie and Martin were fused together, creating the nuclear fusion-powered hero, <a href=\"/firestorm/29-2353/\">Firestorm</a>, the Nuclear Man; while Black was fissioned apart into multiple, slightly smaller, copies of himself, becoming <a href=\"/multiplex/29-3412/\">Multiplex</a>, the Multiple Villain. </p><p>Though Firestorm eventually repaired the Plant, it was never officially opened, due to the investigation into the events of that evening.  Stein's dream was never fully realized, and he moved on to other projects, while Black went from being a petty thief and scientist to full-time super-villain.  There was a subsequent adventure with <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> in which it was revealed that the plant had gained sentience through the disaster and was attempting to control Firestorm, but it is no longer clear if that story is within current continuity, due to <a href=\"/crisis-on-infinite-earths/39-40764/\">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Crimson Dawn</h2>Crimson Dawn is a world beyond the shadows of the world. Its theme is mostly based on ethnic Chinese culture. The buildings are apparently made up from metal. A place here called Ebony Vain contains the elixir. The elixir was guarded by a Proctor because of its extreme powers.<br /><br />Crimson Dawn is well known for its capability to heal anyone even with superhuman abilities. However, it leaves a red mark near the eyes of those people who have been healed. The most notable character who was healed in Crimson Dawn was the X-Man, <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">            Psylocke</a> who have been brought to be healed after being brutally attacked by <a href=\"/sabretooth/29-4563/\">            Sabretooth</a> leading to her coma.<br /><br /> <object id=\"ieooui\"></object> <p> Many centuries ago,  this dimension was overrun by the barbarian Li-Tzu Ch\u2019eng. A group of monks prayed that the kingdom would be spared the endless bloodshed, but the Ming dynasty ended anyway. Frustrated that their prayers hadn\u2019t been answered, Xiandu and three of his friends, Ra\u2019al, Barak and A\u2019yin, went down the darkest road they would ever travel. In the pitch of night they were initiated into a covenant that promised to repel \u2019s oppressors. However Xiandu underestimated the might of the Crimson Dawn, and only learned that his friends had been corrupted by it in the night they killed him. In the instant his life ended, Barak, A\u2019yin and Ra\u2019al found themselves transformed into the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn. Xiandu\u2019s spirit remained on Earth, wandering around to await their inevitable escape from the Crimson realm.</p> <p> <br /> In the present day, Psylocke was almost fatally wounded when Sabretooth escaped from the mansion. As she hovered on the brink between life and death,  happened to know of a magical elixir that could possibly restore her. He and Archangel went to \u2019s  to find the Crimson Dawn, and Dr. Strange, sensing their intent, joined their quest, which brought them to a Chinese restaurant.</p> <p> Over the following months it became quite clear that the experience changed Betsy more than on a skin-deep level. She grew much colder and distanced herself from her lover and their friends. Even when she manifested the ability to shadow-port, Psylocke didn\u2019t bother much nor tell anyone, one day startling the X-Men by teleporting into the mansion without warning. Just like them, Betsy understood that something was amiss with her, but she couldn\u2019t bring herself to talk with anyone about her concerns. When she found herself under attack by a group of Undercloaks, she managed to fight them off all on her own, and did keep the battle secret, not even telling  despite the dark warriors having attacked her in his penthouse.</p> <p> Around the same time, The Dragons of the Crimson Dawn managed to journey to the Wildways, another Magical dimension, the home of <a href=\"/spiral/29-9722/\">          Spiral</a> when not serving <a href=\"/mojo/29-6755/\">           Mojo</a>. They needed the woman to help then teleport to Earth, but when Spiral refused to aid them, she was threatened with torture that was even beyond her Body Shoppe\u2019s capabilities and she reluctantly accepted to join them and received the mark of the Crimson Dawn. Actually Spiral thought she could outsmart the Dragons at one point, but the Crimson Dawn\u2019s influence was too strong and she had no choice but to release them on Earth, namely in London, where they surprise attacked <a href=\"/captain-britain/29-7477/\">         Captain Britain</a>. They took him prisoner to their native, where they wanted to channel his powers into breaching the dimensional wall to the Crimson Dawn, thus enslaving Earth. <br /> <br /> However, Spiral alerted <a href=\"/excalibur/65-14864/\">       Excalibur</a> to the Dragons\u2019 plan, and teleported the team. Another one trying to spoil the plan was Xiandu\u2019s spirit, who told <a href=\"/meggan/29-7604/\">        Meggan</a>, the only one to sense him, of the importance of the location, as it was a nexus of power. The spirit revealed to Meggan that not only her abilities but also her love for Brain was needed to rescue him and stop the two worlds from merging into one. While the rest of Excalibur temporarily held the Dragons of the Crimson Dawn at bay, Meggan helped Brian redirect the power flow, releasing it safely into the atmosphere. While Brian survived, he was Captain  no more, his powers gone. The Dragons left by melting into the shadows, vowing that one day they would succeed and rule Earth.</p> <p> With the dimensional walls already weakened, another creature could break through from the Crimson Dawn, the demon Kuragari. He hunted down Tar, and magically wrested control over Tar\u2019s servants from him, only proceeding to kill him to become the next Proctor of the Crimson Dawn. Gomurr found his old rival\u2019s body, and gave him a decent burial. Knowing that Kuragari would come after Psylocke next, he tried to warn her and , but he happened to be too late. In the meantime, the two X-Men had once again been attacked by Undercloaks, this time leaving behind a strange ring. By the time Gomurr arrived, Betsy, somehow attracted to the piece of jewelry, was already wearing it on her finger, thus allowing Kuragari to abduct her to the Crimson Dawn realm. <br /> <br /> Apparently one can not take from the elixir without giving something in return, and as Psylocke\u2019s debt had never been paid, Kuragari now thought to force her into becoming his bride. She tried to resist as hard as she could, but by the time  arrived, sent after her by Gomurr, Betsy had already been transformed into a shadow creature. While Betsy left with Kuragari,  had to face an entire army of Undercloaks. Back on Earth, Tar\u2019s spirit visited Gomurr, thanking him for the burial and explaining that their past years of enmity had only served one purpose \u2013 training lessons for Gomurr to become the rightful next Proctor.</p> <p> Accepting the mantle passed on to him, Gomurr too crossed over to the Crimson Realm and helped . In order to release Betsy from the Dawn\u2019s hold,  sacrificed an unknown amount of his own life-force to pay the debt. Now free of Kuragari\u2019s influence, Betsy\u2019s darkened skin vanished and together they managed to drive Kuragari away. While the lovers returned home, Gomurr remained behind in his new home.</p> <p> <br /></p><p> With Psylocke dead, it might seem that the X-Men will no longer be confronted with any threats originating from the Crimson Dawn, but there are in fact four other X-Men having some possible connection to the place and the Elixir. For one there is  who sacrificed part of his own life-force and left it in the Ebony Vein. Next there is <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">      Jean Grey</a>, who underwent a strange power-swap with Psylocke shortly before her death. Betsy\u2019s shadowy astral form, for example, had been transferred to Jean, though instead of the Crimson Dawn mark, she wore a  symbol over her eye. Since Betsy\u2019s death, however, Jean was not shown in this form, so the power swap\u2019s effects might have worn off. Then there is <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">     Rogue</a>, who carries the psychic imprints of all people she ever absorbed, including Betsy\u2019s. Last but not least, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">    Wolverine</a>\u2019s backstory with Gomurr and how he learned of the Crimson Dawn has yet to be revealed. <br /> <br /> Further changes awaited Psylocke, as when she found herself tricked by the <a href=\"/shadow-king/29-14889/\">   Shadow King</a> into creating a psionic energy wave that temporarily disabled all psionic abilities on a world-wide scale, she manifested another ability thanks to the Crimson Dawn. Actually the Shadow King had torn apart Betsy\u2019s astral self, leaving her twisted and disfigured. Betsy, though, rebuild herself in a new black form and found that this shadow astral self was nearly impossible to be detected, eventually defeating the Shadow King.</p> <p> Spiral\u2019s status too has not been cleared up, possibly she was able to get rid of the Crimson Dawn\u2019s influence in the meantime, however she has not appeared since. While there was a Spiral in Exiles #18-19, this could easily be an alternate reality version of her (despite Mojo\u2019s claim of there only being one Mojoverse) or a time-traveling past self.</p>",

The main (but certainly not the only) difference between Sliding Albion and the normal Wildstorm Universe Earth is that first contact with an alien species on Sliding Albion was overt. In the default WSU Earth, the two instances of major alien contact (the Kherubim/Daemonite War and the future-sapiens/aliens that modified Jack Hawksmoor) were both covert. Not only was alien contact on Sliding Albion overt, it was the meeting of two \"expansionist renaissance courtly cultures.\" Even though the aliens were much more advanced than the humans, the two races got along very well. So well in fact, that the humanoid aliens bred with human European royalty. This was even more significant because the year in Sliding Albion at the time of alien contact was 1500. By the early twentieth century, the new, merged culture, was a stagnant imperialist society, and it was looking for war. The people of Sliding Albion discovered how to travel The Bleed, the interdimensional highway, and went looking for new Earths to take over. The effort wasn't a strong one, the people were more bored than power hungry. When they came into contact with the main Wildstorm Earth, the fighting stopped quickly and there was a period of peace and cultural exchange. However, in 1953, a world war started that apparently destroyed Sliding Albion.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview:</h2><p>Attilan is the ancestral home of the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\">                      Inhumans</a>, a highly advanced offshoot of the human race. About seven thousand years ago, the Inhumans grew tired of centuries of persecution by their more primitive parent race, and decided to create a place of refuge for themselves. Under the leadership of King Myran, the Inhumans chose as a site for their city a small island in the northern <a href=\"/atlantic-ocean/34-56201/\">                   Atlantic Ocean</a>, located about two hundred miles southwest of <a href=\"/iceland/34-56247/\">                  Iceland</a>. The city, which took several decades to complete, was named Attilan, a name derived from <a href=\"/atlantis/34-41030/\">                 Atlantis</a>, the former pinnacle of civilization on Earth that had vanished beneath the sea about three millennia before. Attilan has been the sole center of the Inhuman population ever since.</p><p>For millennia, the Inhumans dwelt in Attilan, isolated from contact with mainstream humanity except for an occasional encounter with a lost Greek or Viking sailing vessel. Finally, in the mid-Twentieth Century, with the advent of steamships and airplanes, the Inhumans began to fear discovery by the human race. When one of his subjects was captured by human beings, young king <a href=\"/black-bolt/29-4329/\">    Black Bolt</a> determined that the Inhumans must move their civilization to some place more secure. Employing anti-gravity generators, the Inhumans moved their entire city and its foundation in one piece. The new site of Attilan, a hidden valley in the <a href=\"/himalayas/34-55810/\">                Himalayan Mountain</a> range in <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/34-55795/\">               China</a>, was excavated by the <a href=\"/eternals/65-13344/\">              Eternals</a>, another variant offshoot of humanity. The Himalayan site of Attilan became known as \"the Great Refuge.\" The Himalayas did not prove to be remote enough to enable the Inhumans to retain their secrecy, however, and soon the Inhumans' existence became known to several of the governments of the outside world, although not to the general public. While in the Himalayas, all of Attilan's ancient architecture was accidentally destroyed by <a href=\"/black-bolt/29-4329/\">             Black Bolt</a> and the city has been extensively redesigned and rebuilt.</p><p>Since Earth air is deadly to the Inhumans when Attilan was on Earth it had protective barriers. It had five separate defensive systems. A trillion-volt palisade, a progressive eco-filter to scrub the rancid air. And a dome of impenetrable negative space surrounding it all. Attilan was relocated once again, this time to escape the effects of Earthly pollution and disease. Attilan is currently located in the Blue Area of the <a href=\"/the-moon/34-42072/\">            Moon</a>, nestled in the ruins of an ancient city built by the alien <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">           Kree </a>whose technology gives the Blue Area its own artificially created atmosphere.</p><p>Attilan defenses are very powerful. It has been able to travel outside of Earth in space without being damaged. It has also been able to take an attack of cannons and bombs. Th e shield would evaporate the bombs and just absorb the energy, making it stronger on every attack. There was a machine that <a href=\"/maximus/29-3447/\">          Maximus </a>built that would disrupt the shield and cause it to fall. With this and lightning the shield of Attilan would fall. Even though the shield is very strong it has been compromised by the Kree and the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">         Skrulls</a>.</p><p>Outside of Attilan is a junkyard of <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\">        Shi'ar</a> technology that the Inhumans do not use. This space is used as a playground for curious Inhuman children. Underneath the city of Attilan lies the <a href=\"/alpha-primitives/65-55902/\">       Alpha Primitives</a>, and the technology that keeps Attilan working. This is a basement like structure full of&nbsp;machines&nbsp;that the Alpha Primitives call mother. <br />&nbsp;<br />After the Inhumans took over leadership of the Kree Empire, Attilan was moved to <a href=\"/hala/34-56002/\">      Hala</a>, the capital of the empire.<br /></p><h2>Features:</h2><p>Attilan is far more technologically advanced than other cities of its era. The Inhumans have used their technology to relocate the city and the island upon which it is built to other locations, even taking it off of the planet itself. <br />&nbsp;<br /><b>Video Games </b><br />&nbsp;<br />Attilan appears as a base in the video-game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance when the heroes are saved from <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doom</a> by the <a href=\"/watcher/29-7120/\">Watcher</a>.<br /></p>",

        "description":"<p>Project: P.E.G.A.S.U.S. \"Potential Energy Group/Alternate Sources/United States\" was founded with the idea of researching alternate forms of renewable energy, but has also been used as a <span>prison</span> for super-powered individuals. The location of this facility is described as being in the <span>Adirondack Mountains</span> in <span>New York State</span>. Headed by Dr. Myron Wilburn, it quickly found itself at the center of much unwanted attention when the structure came to house a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/29-38665/\">Cosmic Cube</a>, a Nth Projector, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/serpent-crown/18-15780/\">Serpent Crown</a> and several other artifacts of great power. Soon the Project also began testing on metahuman specimens, mostly career criminals, but others, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aquarian/29-24592/\">Aquarian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a> were also tested extensively, yet humanely. The Project became little better than a prison to many of the specimens such as, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/klaw/29-3171/\">Klaw</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/solaar/29-10310/\">Solaar</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nuklo/29-14560/\">Nuklo</a>, and as such they sought escape. </p>\n<p>Shortly after the project's completion, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a> was offered the position of Head of Security, based on his service record with the army, SHIELD, and a recommendation from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>. He served in this role admirably for several months, with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>'s help he, along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thundra/29-7235/\">Thundra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a>, and Aquarian saved the world and potentially the universe from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mysterium/29-52762/\">Dr. Thomas Lightner</a>, who had turned himself into a living singularity, calling himself the Nth Man.</p>\n<p>Months later, the entire Project was taken over by the Serpent Crown. Only the intervention of several outsiders averted a complete disaster. Quasar blamed himself and tendered his resignation. He was soon replaced by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-shield/29-19957/\">Blue Shield</a>, who held the position for several years was just recently replaced by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkhawk/29-2111/\">Darkhawk</a>. When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/squadron-supreme/65-40479/\">Squadron Supreme</a> were exiled from their universe by Dr. Lightner, they made the Project their temporary home.<br /><br />Quasar returned briefly to save the Project from the sentient alien armor that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> brought back with him from Battleworld (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-wars-ii/39-55688/\">Secret Wars II</a>)&nbsp;as it attempted to consume the entire Project. Quasar managed to&nbsp;fly it down the magma tap which destroyed it.<br /><br />During <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, the project was inveded by a cadre of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> who recognized the threat that PEGASUS meant to their invasion since there were devices held at Project PEGASUS was could litterally burn the Skrull fleet out of the sky.

        "description":"<p>Founded by Bert Vaughn, Animators Inc. is the only zombie-raising firm in the Midwest. It is located in St. Louis, Missouri. It started out in a spare room above a garage, but moved a few years later to an office building shared with a real estate company, lawyers, a marriage counselor, psychologists, and plastic surgeons. The firm consists of a reception room and three offices. Bert thought homey, calm feel for the clients, so the wallpaper in the office is pale green (reception) and blue (offices). Bert chose the smallest office for himself and the other two offices are shared between the four animators:</p><p>Anita Blake: Most powerful of the animators. She can raise 100+ year old zombies (rare talent), so Bert lets her have most of the publicity for the company. She is also a legal vampire hunter, hence the nickname \"The Executioner\".</p><p>Manny Rodriguez: A retired vampire hunter, Manny trained Anita to raise zombies and hunt vampires. Manny was almost killed by a vampire a few years ago, so his wife, Rosita, convinced him to stop hunting vampires for the sake of his life and his family.</p><p>Jamison Clarke: Jamison is very much so pro-vampire and tends to butt heads with Anita a lot.</p><p>Charles (last name unknown): Charles is a little squeamish when it comes to raising zombies, but does his job well and takes care of his four year old child.</p><p>The fee for raising a zombie depends on its age. A standard fee is somewhere around $3,000, but Bert makes his clients pay dearly for very old zombies. A 100 year old zombie would cost someone around $20,000 to have raised. Most corpses are raised for court purposes, mainly witnesses who died before they could testify. People also sometimes have a loved one raised so they can say their good-byes if they didn't get the chance. </p><p>Animators Inc. has two secretaries:</p><p>Mary: A fifty-something grandmother, who Anita swears uses a can of hairspray to keep her hair in place. Mary works the day shift.</p><p>Craig: Craig is the night-time secretary.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Introduction</h2><p>The Leaf village is the most powerful and prosperous of the five great ninja villages and has had a long history of great leaders that they honor with a Mt. Rushmore-like cliff-side, with a carving of each of the <a href=\"/hokage/65-50942/\"> Hokage</a>'s faces on it.<br />It was here that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/44238/\"> Naruto Uzumaki</a> was born, also known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyuubi/46398/\"> Nine Tailed Fox</a>'s recipient, a \"host\" if you will. It is also the birthplace of many of the Naruto series' main characters, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sasuke/44241/\"> Sasuke Uchiha</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/itachi/44260/\"> Itachi Uchiha</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kakashi/44243/\"> Kakashi Hatake</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sakura/44242/\"> Sakura Haruno</a>.</p><p>WARNING:<br />The following article may or may not contain spoilers, depending on whether or not you have read the Japanese Naruto, which, like most manga, is far ahead of where we are in America. This article is based off of strictly what is happening in the manga at this time and what has already happened, not the english anime, and therefore may contain spoilers for readers who have not kept up with the Japanese manga.</p><p><a> </a></p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Konohagakure, also known as Konoha, The Village Hidden in the Leaves, and the Leaf Village, was formed by its <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-first-hokage/49812/\"> First Leader</a>, aka its <a href=\"/hokage/65-50942/\"> Hokage</a> , by himself. The First Hokage was renowned for his extreme ability to manipulate wood and other jutsu, was of course dubbed as the greatest ninja of Konoha. </p> <a><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49812/146163-the-first-hokage_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong> The First and Second Hokage</strong> <br /><br />He was singlehandedly able to form the Leaf village, and, it was no less amazing that this formation took place with a single jutsu done in nearly minutes. The first Hokage's name was Shodai, and that is all that is known of him, or all that has thus been revealed in the Naruto universe. However, he is obviously not the one who formed it's Mount Rushmore like stone carvings, as they include multiple other Hokage in it, some far after his time. It is a fairly large city to be called a village, and has a number of places in which people go to just to have fun, like Ramen shops and parks. For a series with characters so dark and mysterious, you'd think that the city would be a bit more protected and less bright and happy, with children running around and having fun all of the time, like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/konohamaru/50189/\"> the Third Hokage's grandson</a>. The village contains many shops and stores, as well as places just to sight see. Konoha is, has been, and more than likely will continue to be the most friendly of the ninja villages in the Narutoverse. <p><a> </a></p><h2>Leaders</h2><p>So far, Konoha has had five leaders, also known as its Hokage. The word Hokage means \"Fire Shadow\", and is given to them as they are the biggest village in the fire nation, with the most power and influence. It should also be noted that the leaders of other villages are not called Hokage, but something else, like the Sand Villages Kazekage, given to it as it the largest village in the Land of Wind, of course meaning \"Wind Shadow\", the pattern is quite noticeable. The Five Hokage leaders have done as much as they could to help their village in times of need, and so far, their attempts have obviously worked. For more information on them, please visit the <a href=\"/hokage/65-50942/\"> Hokage</a> page. Here will simply give you a brief explanation of what they've done and the slightly complex history of the third and fourth.<br /></p><h3>The First Hokage</h3> was from the Senju Clan of the forest, and was apparently able to use his wood based jutsu very skillfully. He, as mentioned before, singlehandedly made the Konoha that we know today.<br /><h3>The Second Hokage</h3> was an intense water based jutsu user, and not much is known about him, other than that he was able to create and manipulate water by pulling it from the atmosphere.<br /><h3>The Third Hokage</h3> was dubbed \"The Professor\" by his fellow shinobi due to his massive knowledge of techniques and how to use them. He was the oldest living of the Hokage, and was killed by Orochimaru. In the beginning of Naruto, he was the Hokage, though they consistently talked about what great things the Fourth Hokage had done. The reason that there was no fifth was because they had no good candidates, and the Third Hokage was willing to come out of his retirement to help the people of Leaf.<br /><strong>The Fourth Hokage</strong> is possibly the most well recognized by the media for being Hokage. He is a Naruto icon that entails one of the series' favorite themes, Sacrafice. The Fourht Hokage, as explained early in the series, was the one that went toe to toe with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyuubi/46398/\">  The Nine Tailed Fox</a>, defeating it by using the jutsu that the Third Hokage used later in the series on Orochimaru, but, was only able to seal it into his son, Naruto Uzumaki.<br /><strong>The Fifth Hokage</strong>, Tsunade, is also a Naruto icon, mainly based on her developed physical stature and for her position as the toughest of the Naruto female cast. She is hemophobic (afraid of blood) due to her boyfriend's bloody death that she was unable to prevent. Tsunade is a practitioner of the healing arts and an extremely able fighter. She was also one of the three <a href=\"/sannin/65-45212/\"> Sannin</a>.<p><a> </a></p><h2>Major Events</h2><p><strong>These are not all of the major events in chronological order, they will be explained as they were in the manga. Meaning, though the Uchiha Massacre occurred before the Chuunin Exams, it will be explained afterwards as it was explained afterwards in the manga. This is, in some extent, chronological, but only to the manga timeline, not the story within itself.</strong></p><p>Konoha is famous for having the strongest Shinobi Village military, and for being a major trade center in the land of fire. The main characters in Naruto are almost all denizens of Konoha, and many of the major events in the Narutoverse happen within the Leaf Village. Of the main story, the most important regarding Naruto would be the incident of the Nine Tailed Fox, in which Madara Uchiha, aka Tobi </p> <a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/45000/45000/97843-tobi_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/45000/45000/97843-tobi_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>Tobi, aka Madara Uchiha</strong> <br /><br />of the <a href=\"/akatsuki/65-45002/\"> Akatsuki</a>, lead an attack against the village. As mentioned in the leaders section, the beats was run down and defeated by the Yondaime (aka The Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze) and sealed into Naruto, for reasons still unknown. This of course killed The Fourth, and caused the Third to come out of retirement. This is why he was still the man in control of the legendary village at the start and they still spoke of the Fourth, as if it were not for this then the chronological order would be out of whack. <p><a> </a></p><p><strong>Chuunin Exams</strong></p><p>The first major even to happen within Konoha itself for the entire series was the Chuunin Exams, an event that had multiple villages send in their Genin for a test to see which were worthy of attaining the next rank in ninja hood. This arc introduced most of the main cast, actually, for all of Part I in the manga. It introduced characters like <a href=\"/gaara/29-44258/\"> Gaara</a>, <a href=\"/hinata/29-44280/\"> Hinata</a>, <a href=\"/shino/29-44281/\"> Shino</a>, <a href=\"/kiba/29-44279/\"> Kiba</a>, <a href=\"/orochimaru/29-44259/\"> Orochimaru</a>, <a href=\"/kabuto/29-44523/\"> Kabuto</a>, <a href=\"/kurenai/29-44516/\"> Kurenai</a>, <a href=\"/jiraiya/29-44511/\"> Jiraiya</a>, <a href=\"/ino/29-44248/\"> Ino</a>, <a href=\"/shikamaru/29-44247/\"> Shikamaru</a>, <a href=\"/lee/29-44527/\"> Lee</a>, <a href=\"/guy/29-45030/\"> Guy</a>, and of course a majority of the characters affiliated with those said. In the Chuunin Exams every major and basically secondary character showed up for part I, and basically they did what a majority of manga characters do, fight and look cool while doing it. At first, Naruto and his team might not have been able to even participate in the exams, as Sakura didn't think she could do it. Well, in the end, though she did decide to go for it anyways, it didn't quite matter as the team would only be trying to help each other out for one of the three tests, the rest of them they were on their own for the most part.</p>",

There is possibly an infinite number of different realities, some of which is located outside the Multiverse, but still has an earth-designation. An example of this is Earth-14861, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-universe/34-55729/\">New Universe</a>.</p><p>The various realities are always called Earth-[number], despite referring to the whole reality, not just the earth. It is also, but <i>less frequently</i>, called Reality-[number].</p><p>The Multiverse was originally established as being protected by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/merlyn/29-14820/\">Merlyn</a>, and later by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saturnyne/29-14813/\">Saturnyne</a> and the [Captain Britain] Corps. There are other beings and groups dealing with protecting the Multiverse, for example the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/time-variance-authority/65-27634/\">Time Variance Authority</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exiles/65-19986/\">Exiles</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/armor/65-53864/\">A.R.M.O.R.</a></p><p>Most realities has a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain/29-7477/\">Captain Britain</a> designated to protect its version of the British Isles and in extension the reality. These protectors are collectively known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-britain-corps/65-23438/\">Corps.</a></p><p>New realities are constantly created and often involves time traveling characters as time travel in Marvel comics always creates divergent realities, and it is not possible to alter time or travel back to your own past.</p><h3>Omniverse</h3><p>The term Omniverse refers to all Marvel realities as well as <b><i>every</i></b> other fictional universe or reality ever created.</p><h2>Earth-616</h2><p>The main continuity in which most Marvel storylines take place was designated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-616/12-40920/\">Earth-616</a>. The term Earth-616 was first used by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-moore/26-40382/\">Alan Moore</a> in his run of the Marvel UK comic Captain Britain.Fans originally thought that the number 616 was a reference of the release date of the first <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/49-2045/\">Fantastic Four</a> comic. However Alan Moore when asked about it said that 616 was just a random number of no significance chosen because people always seemed to be talking about 'earth 2' or 'earth 4' but never any higher numbers. <a href=\"http://www.marvel.com/universe/OHOTMU:FAQ#Why_do_you_number_Earths.3F\" rel=\"nofollow\">See here for reference.</a></p><h2>Significant storylines and their realities</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/1602/39-41147/\">1602</a> - Earth-311</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a> - Earth-295</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/days-of-future-past/39-44425/\">Days of Future Past</a> - Earth-811</li><li>Earth X - Earth-9997</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> - Earth-58163</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-mangaverse/12-46090/\">Mangaverse</a> - Earth-2301</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/39-40611/\">Marvel Zombies</a> - Earth-2149</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mc2/12-43721/\">MC2</a> - Earth-982</li><li>Mutant X - Earth 1298</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimate-universe/12-40390/\">Ultimate Universe</a> - Earth-1610</li></ul><h2>Alternate realities</h2><h3><b>Earth-0000/Earth Prime</b></h3><p><a href=\"/armor/65-53864/\">A.R.M.O.R.</a> gave this\ndesignation to reality, the non-fictional world in which Marvel Comics is a\ncompany and all of the other worlds are comic books written by them.

As the fight came to an end, Magneto revealed an international conspiracy against mutants, involving Richard Nixon. So it was that Magneto was granted sovereignty over Genosha, and became the leader of the world's mutants.</p><p>Because of this, the most important laws became those that protected the lives of mutants. Examples of this was that performing stem cell research with mutant embryos was prohibited while using altered human embryos was allowed. This is how the racism became quite opposite, in that Sapiens were the outcasts in society and mutants held all great positions of power. Though some humans were given privileges the majority of Sapiens were rejected by society.</p><p>This reality is first made known to residents of Earth-616 when the X-Men and Avengers plot to kill Wanda Maximoff because of the dangers of her insanity. So it is that back at Genosha, the Maximoff family unites ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>).</p><p>So the heroes return to Genosha to find all of them missing and slowly, one by one, they are all engulfed by a white light...and transported to the \"House of M\" reality, officially known as Earth-58163.</p><p>It seems in this reality, Wanda has granted everyone their desires so that they can be truly happy. And none of the Earth-616 natives remember this, except for Wolverine of course who has his memory completely restored.</p><p>The key to saving all those who have fallen prey to Wanda is the mysterious young girl, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a> who remembers everything and has the power to restore one's memory of their Earth-616 life.</p><p>So after she \"awakens\" more than a dozen heroes who are ready to bring the fight to Magneto, who at that moment ignores his daughter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a> while mourning the loss of his good friend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>.</p><p>While the team flies to Genosha in a helicarrier, they talk amongst each other about the upcoming fight and Jessica Drew brings up the fact that since they've all been given what they want, shouldn't they be content...but Wolverine ignores the thought.</p><p>The team arrives at Genosha and a battle ensues between the House of Magnus and the mutant royalty that has come to Genosha to celebrate the triumph of Homo Superior versus the \"awakened\" heroes.</p><p>As the battle continues it seems that everyone is to meet their end here, but when Magneto learns the truth of the matter (that it was Pietro who had Wanda create this fantasy world) he began to unleash his fury upon everyone, especially his son.</p><p>Quicksilver is beaten to a bleeding mass, but the Scarlet Witch comes to his rescue and heals his body and becomes angry with her father and her next few words change Earth-616 so drastically that it would likely be best if it could be undone.

It was in the original Republic, was captured by the Empire and later joined the New Republic.</p><h2>Inhabitants</h2><p>Kashyyyk is inhabitated by billions wroshyr trees that completely encompass the surface of the planet in thick foliage. As a result the land at the floor is very dark and relatively inhabitable for humans. Wookies are the primary sentient creatures that inhabit the planet. In order to survive they have had to build large catwalks and tree houses were they can survive high above the eerie shadowlands in which many carniverous plants lived that were fully cpaable of eating a fully grown human or adolescent wookie. The forests are divided into 7 layers and the majority of wookies live above the 4th and practically none venture onto the surface.</p><h2>Notable Events</h2><p>During the war between the Jedi and the Sith, The Brotherhood of Darkness took control of Kashyyyk until they were eventually repelled by the Jedi. During the Clone Wars the Wookies allied themselves with the Rebuplic prompting an invasion from the Separatists. This invasion was met by Republic and Wookie forces and most famously Grand Master Yoda, the Republic despite daunting odds won. Yoda and several other jedi were on Kashyyyk when Order 66 was announced and only Yoda escaped the planet, the rest were either killed or forced into hiding. Following the Rise of the Empire and the declaration of Jedi as outlaws, Kashyyyk didn't join the Empire or extradite their jedi inhabitants, as a result Darth Vader tried to burn down the forest, the wookies rebelled, however were soon overrun and occupied by the Empire under a Moff. During the Yuuzhan Vong war significant areas of forest were burnt down by the Vong. In the second Galactic Civil War Jacen Solo, using long range turbolasers destroyed immense areas of forest before being driven off by the jedi.</p><h2>Famous Inhabitants</h2><ul><li>Grand Master Yoda spent a great deal of time living among the wookies and training young jedi in the outpost there.</li><li>Chewbacca, undoubtedly the most famous wookie of all time, was co-pilot of the <i>millenium falcon</i> and friend of both Luke Skywalker and Yoda later became a Hero of the Rebellion which was recognised with his medal of honour.</li><li>Lowbacca <i>nephew of</i> Chewbacca, is one of the few force sensitive wookies, and goes on to become a jedi Knight at a similar time to Jaina Solo</li></ul>",

The first Death Star had a tractor beam that was &nbsp;powered internally that could be used offensively. The battle of Endor took place as the&nbsp;unfinished&nbsp;Death Star II was unable to protect itself at that stage and was reliant on the shield array base on the forest moon to supply its protection.<br /><br /> The main cannon its self was without equal in the Star Wars universe for sheer destructive power. Able to obliterate a planet with very little preparation or warm up period it did require&nbsp;several&nbsp;minutes cool-down/recharge time when&nbsp;engaging&nbsp;multiple targets such as capital-ships.<br /><br /> <h2>Propulsion</h2>The Death Star appears very slow moving both on its own axis and what might be called forward propulsion with no&nbsp;visible&nbsp;means of that propulsion. It does&nbsp;beg&nbsp;the question when facing it the forces always face its cannon rather than attacking from the opposite side (other than for visual and&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;reasons of course).<br /> <h2>Vulnerability</h2>Much in the same way the AT-AT is a hammer blow against an opposing force its size is also its weakness. While Ion&nbsp;torpedoes&nbsp;can&nbsp;penetrate&nbsp;the outer skin and&nbsp;cause&nbsp;internal damage, due to the sheer scale of the station, they have little impact when undirected.&nbsp;<br /><br /> The first Death Star was destroyed&nbsp;because&nbsp;it had a small exhaust port that linked the&nbsp;outer&nbsp;skin with the core reactor and the missiles were delivered directly into it. &nbsp;The second Death Star's weakness was its gaping&nbsp;unfinished&nbsp;super structure allowing&nbsp;passage&nbsp;of&nbsp;Rebellion&nbsp;craft&nbsp;directly&nbsp;down to its reactor core where they fired directly into the reactor itself. this was possible once the shield on Endor was shut down, allowing access inside.",

        "description":"<h2>Tatooine</h2><p>Tatooine is an arid planet, thanks to its twin suns Tatoo I and Tatoo II and is mostly inhabited by moisture farmers who are not native to the planet itself. It is usually known for being a planet led by its own inhabitants though it was once under the control of the Sith. However, for many years up until the time of Luke Skywalker it was controlled by the Hutts, the last of which was Jabba the Hutt.</p><p><b>List of Those Who Have Been on Tatooine and the Events Concerning Their Life on Tatooine:</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/boba-fett/29-6354/\">Boba Fett</a>: At one point, Boba Fett came to Tatooine while performing his bounty hunter duties, and so he remained in Jabba the Hutt's court for some time, never taking off his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mandalorian-battle-armor/18-53506/\">Mandalorian armor</a>. So it was that when Luke came to Chewbacca, Leia and Han's rescue he found himself facing the greatest bounty hunter in the Star Wars universe. Yet, surprisingly, Boba Fett was defeated accidentally by Han Solo who was blinded. So he fell into the Pit of Carkoon where he is caught by a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sarlacc/29-16190/\">Sarlacc</a>. Eventually he manages to escape, and regain his title as the Universe's greatest bounty hunter.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/c-3po/29-6335/\">C-3PO</a>: The droid known as C-3PO was originally created by a young child named Anakin Skywalker, on the planet of Tatooine. However, at that point of his \"life\" he still was \"naked\" as he had no plating yet still he functioned to his full capacity. But C-3PO was not left on Tatooine when Anakin departed for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/coruscant/34-48936/\">Coruscant</a>. Rather he left the planet and over the course of many years was upgraded in appearance to the droid he is now. But many years, and a wiped memory later, C-3PO returned to Tatooine. This time it was with his new owner, Leia Organa (Skywalker), none of them knowing his own past. He went on an excursion with R2-D2 and performed tasks for Luke Skywalker, going through many trials and tribulations. But eventually he once again left the desolate planet of Tatooine to resume his job as a translator droid as adventure just wasn't for him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chewbacca/29-6334/\">Chewbacca</a>: Chewbacca went to Tatooine as part of the plan to save Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca was needed so that it could appear Leia was a bounty hunter and had brought him in for the money. So he was temporarily housed in Jabba's prison cells, an experience he did not enjoy. But in the end, Han Solo was rescued and Chewie left the planet fully intact and unscathed.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-maul/29-5406/\">Darth Maul</a>: It is in the deserts of Tatooine that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jedi/12-52199/\">Jedi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-sith/65-44460/\">Sith</a> have their first encounter in many years. Darth Maul representing the power of the Sith versus Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi representing the weakness of the Jedi. Though the fight was short, it was the Sith finally coming out of the shadows and revealing themselves. Darth Maul proved himself to be far more adept at fighting than either of the Jedi and most likely would have defeated them had they not been departing in their spacecraft during the confrontation. However, the next time they would meet the Jedi would no longer be caught off guard, leading to Maul's downfall.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-vader/29-6342/\">Darth Vader</a>: Anakin Skywalker was born and raised on the planet Tatooine as a slave. It was his mother Shmi Skywalker who cared for him and often worried about his joy of pod-racing. It was on Tatooine that he created the droid that would become C-3PO but his dreams came true when some Jedi arrived on the planet and discovered his potential to wield <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-force/12-50253/\">The Force</a>. So, he was won from his owner, Watto by the two Jedi at 9 years of age and not long afterwards became the Padawan of Obi-Wan Kenobi. He late returns to the planet on his own when he has visions of his mother's death but he arrives too late to save her from the Tusken Raiders. In his grief and anger he lashes out, mercilessly slaughtering the entire Tuskan camp, and leaving no survivors and so begins his journey into the Dark Side of The Force.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/han-solo/29-2608/\">Han Solo</a>: Han Solo arrives on Tatooine after Jabba puts up a bounty for him and Boba Fett seeks the reward. Han Solo is frozen in carbonite by Darth Vader and then delivered to Jabba by Fett. Han Solo is left to decorate Jabba's Palace as a trophy until Leia releases him from the carbonite, though he remains blind for several hours. So it is that he barely gets to enjoy Tatooine and when he is to be fed to a Sarlacc instead he accidentally defeats Boba Fett. He is then rescued from the desert planet, his sight fully restored and his debt to Jabba off his back.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jabba-the-hutt/29-16184/\">Jabba The Hutt</a>: Jabba the Hutt is in a sense the ruler of Tatooine seeing as it is on the Outer Rim and outside of the Republic's control. He is a mighty crime lord and known for providing both smugglers and bounty hunters a job. It was because of his imprisonment of Han Solo that Luke, R2, C-3PO, Leia, Lando and Chewbacca all risked their lives to infiltrate Jabba's Palace. However Jabba proved himself to be too powerful for Luke's using of The Force and Leia's disguise. So he made Leia his sex slave for her punishment and denied Luke his request for Han's freedom. Eventually this led to a confrontation that resulted in his death when Leia choked him with the chain that had once bound her to the slug.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jar-jar-binks/29-6420/\">Jar Jar Binks</a>: Jar Jar Binks comes to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naboo/34-56385/\">Naboo</a> as a tag-along of the Queen's Court, he soon proves himself to only be able to get into trouble and so it is decided a close eye needs to be kept on him. Whether or not he matures any on his short stay on Tatooine is not known, however it is known that for at least short periods he did learn the error of his ways.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lando-calrissian/29-6355/\">Lando Calrissian</a>: Lando Calrissian, another criminal much like Han Solo was came to Tatooine when Solo needed to be rescued from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt. He infiltrated Jabba's Palace by wearing the guise of a mercenary. Eventually he too aided in the saving of Han Solo and escape from Tatooine.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-skywalker/29-6315/\">Luke Skywalker</a>: Despite being born elsewhere, soon after his birth Luke was brought to the home planet of his father, to keep him safe and hidden. He was left with his father's relatives(<a href=\"/owen-lars/29-6318/\">Owen Lars</a>) and watched over throughout his maturing years by Obi-Wan Kenobi. So Luke lived the life of a moisture farmer for many years, all he was told of his origins is that his father Anakin was murdered by Darth Vader. Eventually however things began moving ahead quickly for the young man and he learned the truth of \"Ben\" Kenobi and was given a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lightsaber/18-44097/\">lightsaber</a> after the discovery of his force potential.So it was that Luke then left Tatooine, and like his father began a life far different from one from the one he had. A life that anyone who dwelt on Tatooine might never imagine.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/padme-amidala/29-6343/\">Padme Amidala</a>: Padm\u00e9 Amidala first came to Tatooine unintentionally when she was advised to leave Naboo, the planet she ruled, because it was being conquered by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trade-federation/65-56739/\">Trade Federation</a>. She was only fourteen at the time, and the ship she and her crew were in needed to land, their only choice was Tatooine where they could hopefully repair their ship and continue their journey to Coruscant. Once there she meets a young nine year old boy named Anakin Skywalker who seems to be the only worker at the shop the two Jedi accompanying her seek. Anakin reveals himself to be very knowledgeable about ships, and a boy with many dreams one of which is that he will marry the beautiful angel before him, Padm\u00e9. At points it seems she doubts Anakin during her stay on Tatooine and is worried when all the money the Jedi possess is bet on Anakin winning a pod-race, something he has never done before. Yet he succeeds and the two leave Tatooine together, unsurprisingly he does become her lover, her secret husband and father of her children (Luke and Leia).</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/obi-wan-kenobi/29-2206/\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>: Obi-Wan first comes to Tatooine when he is Qui-Gon's Padawan and there he meets Anakin. He almost seems jealous of the boy, as Qui-Gon pays far more attention to him than to Obi-Wan. Yet it is many years later after he has trained Anakin and nearly killed him that he brings his son Luke Skywalker to Tatooine and takes up residence on the planet. He watches over Luke in secret for many years, retaining all the knowledge he had of Anakin and the time before the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empire/65-45742/\">Empire</a>. Obi-Wan eventually takes Luke under his wing while on Tatooine, gives him a lightsaber and teaches him a bit about The Force and his father.The two then depart to save Princess Leia, however, Obi-Wan is killed by Darth Vader before he ever gets the chance to return to Tatooine.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/princess-leia/29-33545/\">Princess Leia</a>: Princess Leia travels to Tatooine (not knowing its the home planet of her birth father) in her efforts to rescue her lover, Han Solo. She brings Chewbacca in for a bounty to make her disguise as a bounty hunter more convincing. However, when she frees Han from his carbonite in the dead of night she is caught by Jabba and his court. As punishment for her acts, she is made Jabba's sex slave and so stripped down to next to nothing and chained to Jabba. She is forced to do his bidding but when Luke mounts an attack on Jabba's court she proves her ferocity when she strangles Jabba with the chain that held them together. She then proceeds to be rescued by Luke throughout the ensuing battle and she eventually leaves Tatooine, only to learn of its importance to her family later.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/qui-gon-jinn/29-5411/\">Qui-Gon Jinn</a>: When Qui-Gon Jinn is made the leader of the Queen's Court, which is fleeing Naboo he convinces the group that they need to land on Tatooine to repair the ship and with some talking the Queen agrees. It is here that Qui-Gon meets the boy he has been searching for for years, Anakin, the one who he believes will fulfill The Prophecy. He plans to train the boy, though his Padawan Obi-Wan thinks it unwise, yet still Qui-Gon puts his full faith in the boy. And when parts are needed it is he who agrees to have Anakin win a pod-race so they can buy parts for their ship but that is only if his mother allows him. As a bonus, he makes a deal with Watto (cheating on his part) to get Anakin freed when he wins the race. So Qui-Gon leaves the planet having experienced some significant events including the combating of a Sith Apprentice and acquiring of a potential Jedi.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/r2-d2/29-2594/\">R2-D2</a>: R2-D2 first arrives on Tatooine alongside his \"master\" Padme Amidala and it is there that he meets two of his greatest companions in the future, Anakin Skywalker and C-3PO. R2 returns to Tatooine many years later with a mind-wiped C-3PO when he goes there in his effort to find help for Princess Leia. Unfortunately he is captured by Jawas and sold to the Lars family. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/owen-lars/29-6318/\">Owen Lars</a> puts the mischievous droid in the care of Luke Skywalker but R2 sees the boy as being no help to his mission and instead seeks out \"Ben\" Kenobi. Luke is forced to chase after R2 and so both of them meet up with \"Ben\" resulting in Luke learning a little of his heritage. So it is that R2 then leaves Tatooine again only to return a third time when Han Solo is in need of being rescued. R2-D2 plays an important part in the rescue of the smuggler and proves how valuable he really is.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sebulba/29-5438/\">Sebulba</a>: Sebulba is an alien inhabitant of Tatooine who has lived their his entire life. He is known to be one of the dishonest, low-lives of the planet and considered to be one of its greatest pod-racers even though he cheats to win. Because of this he is also a young Anakin's rival and almost ends up being the cause for Padme and the Jedi being trapped on Tatooine as their escape depended upon Anakin's win. Yet Anakin eventually succeeded in the race, winning his first match and defeating Sebulba once and for all.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shmi-skywalker/29-6375/\">Shmi Skywalker</a>: Shmi Skywalker is known to have been a slave of Watto for many years, yet most of her past before the arrival of Padme Amidala and her crew on Tatooine is unknown. She was very protective of her son, Anakin, and always wished the best for him. She was often worried about him, as his hobbies were not things she felt a normal boy should be doing, like pod-racing. Yet when Qui-Gon Jinn gave Anakin a chance at a better life she gave her consent for him to leave her on Tatooine as a slave while he could live his dreams. She eventually was freed from remaining a slave but it was not long afterwards that she was captured by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tusken-raiders/65-56730/\">Tusken Raiders</a> whose tortures ended up killing her. She died on the planet of Tatooine, in the arms of her son who had returned for her, a little too late.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watto/29-6336/\">Watto</a>: Watto is an alien who has accomplished very little inside of his life besides becoming lazier and gaining weight. He was the slaver of both Shmi Skywalker and Anakin up until the point that Padme and the Jedi arrived on Tatooine and won Anakin from him. Watto kept Shmi as his slave for some time after that but eventually he gave up on her and lost her to the Lars family. When Anakin returned to save his mother he learned this and also learned that Watto had become overweight since the last time they had seen each other.</p><h2>Points of interest:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mos-eisley/34-56387/\">Mos Eisley</a></li><li>Mos Espa</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jundland-wastes/34-56468/\">The Jundland Wastes</a></li><li>The Dune Sea</li><li>Lars Family Moisture Farm</li><li>B'Omarr Temple</li><li>The Great Pit of Carkoon</li><li>Toschi Station</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beggars-canyon/34-56389/\">Beggar's Canyon</a></li></ul><h2>Native Sentient Species:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jawas/65-56709/\">Jawas</a></li><li><a href=\"/tusken-raiders/65-56730/\">Tusken Raiders</a></li></ul><h2>Native animal species:</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banthas/29-64002/\">Bantha</a></li><li><a href=\"/sarlacc/29-16190/\">Sarlacc</a></li><li>Wamprat</li><li>Ronto</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krayt-dragon/29-64148/\">Krayt Dragon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dewback/29-64139/\">Dewback</a></li><li>Massiff</li></ul><h2><strong>Notable Residents:</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"/luke-skywalker/29-6315/\">Luke Skywalker</a></li><li><a href=\"/star-wars-episode-i-anakin-skywalker/49-21025/\">Anakin Skywalker</a></li><li><a href=\"/shmi-skywalker/29-6375/\">Shmi Skywalker</a></li><li><a href=\"/owen-lars/29-6318/\">Owen Lars</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beru-lars/29-6319/\">Beru Lars</a></li><li><a href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/29-2206/\">Obi-Wan Kenobi</a></li><li><a href=\"/jabba-the-hutt/29-5441/\">Jabba The Hutt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/biggs-darklighter/29-6321/\">Biggs Darklighter</a></li><li><a href=\"/watto/29-6336/\">Watto</a></li><li><a href=\"/sebulba/29-5438/\">Sebulba</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bib-fortuna/29-5435/\">Bib Fortuna</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sharad-hett/29-5442/\">Sharad Hett</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darth-krayt/29-45364/\">Darth Krayt</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/greedo/29-2604/\">Greedo</a></li></ul>",

The demonstartion was meant to cow the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empire/65-45742/\">Empire's </a>restive worlds and keep them in line, but the Death Star was destroyed days later, and Alderaan became a reallying cry for individuals, systems, and species now determined to resist the New Order.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Alderaan formally adopted pacifism after the Clone&nbsp;Wars, ridding itself of all major weaponry. Cynics noted that this seemingly idealistic move made it easier for the planet and its respected leader, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/senator-bail-organa/29-6320/\">Bail Organa</a>, to actively oppose the New Order in the Senate--all in the name of the finest traditions of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/old-republic/65-51880/\">Republic</a>, of course.

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Belle Reve Penitentiary (also referred to as \"Belle Reve Federal Prison\" and more recently, if inexplicably, as \"Belle Reeve\") is located in the middle of miles of swampland in Terrebonne Parish, <a href=\"/louisiana/34-56211/\">Louisiana</a>. It was specifically constructed to house dangerous <a href=\"/metahuman/12-55705/\">metahuman</a> criminals, and also contains various supervillains. It was chosen by <a href=\"/amanda-waller/29-4920/\">Amanda Waller</a> as the headquarters of Task Force X- also called the <a href=\"/suicide-squad/65-40394/\">Suicide Squad</a>- because of the high concentration of super humans who had very little to lose and everything to gain by participating in a program that could shorten their sentence, should they survive their missions. As the prison is the headquarters for the Squad, many of the prison staff members work with Squad members, along with performing their normal duties in the prison. The prison has been attacked numerous times, and has also withstood numerous governmental and civilian inquiries due to the questionable practice of housing a group of convicted criminals for use in dangerous missions. It has played host to at least two deadly riots, and was at one point located near a portal to <a href=\"/hell/34-42471/\">Hell</a>.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>Kingdom Come</h3><p>In the <a href=\"/kingdom-come/39-41641/\">Kingdom Come</a> universe, Belle Reve was destroyed by Genosyde, who also destroyed other notable prisons. All inmates were killed in the explosion.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Smallville</h3><p>In <i>Smallville</i>, Belle Reve is an insane asylum that mainly houses people who have been poisoned, given powers, and largely driven mad by <a href=\"/kryptonite/18-32213/\">kryptonite</a>, referred to colloquially as \"meteor freaks.\" It also briefly housed <a href=\"/lex-luthor/29-41952/\">Lex Luthor</a>, who was incarcerated there against his will by his father.</p><h3><b>The DCAU</b></h3><p>Belle Reve appears as the headquarters of the Suicide Squad in the <i>Justice League Unlimited</i> episode \"Task Force X\". It also appears in the episode \"Panic in the Sky\" as the prison in which six of the seven founding members of the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">League</a> were incarcerated after turning themselves in to the authorities following the hijacking of their Binary Fusion Generator.</p><h3>Young Justice</h3><p>Belle Reve appeared in the episode \"Terror.\" In this episode, every inmate wears a collar specifically designed to negate that inmate's metahuman ability. This collar is also capable of administering disciplinary shocks that can be made powerful enough to render the inmate unconscious. The prison is claimed to be inescapable, and a mass breakout attempt fails due to the intervention of <a href=\"/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> and <a href=\"/miss-martian/29-41145/\">Miss Martian</a>, who were infiltrating the prison under the guise of the <a href=\"/terror-twins/65-58202/\">Terror Twins</a>. The only inmate to successfully escape the prison during the attempt is the <a href=\"/riddler/29-3718/\">Riddler</a>.</p><p>Following their arrest, the Injustice League was sent to Belle Reve, with the exception of Count Vertigo, who had diplomatic immunity.</p><p>In their search for Red Tornado and T.O. Morrow, the Team stopped by Belle Reve. Warden Strange could not deny them an audience with Morrow's chief competitor, Professor Ivo, because they had helped prevent a prison break. However, when he saw Zatanna was able to extract the desired information from him with ease, he made sure to have Ivo warn Morrow.</p><p>After Queen Perdita of Vlatava revoked Count Vertigo's immunity after a failed coup, he was sent to Belle Reve, and immediately became the subject of mockery from fellow inmates. As the coup involved a coordinated attack from five ice fortresses, Batman suspected the five ice villains in Belle Reve might have been involved. Strange showed him security footage, that showed each of them in their cells at the time of the attacks.</p><p>With Strange's complicity, Sportsmaster broke Professor Ivo out of prison. Strange made sure to shut off the alarms, and control an android of Ivo to make it appear he was still in jail.</p>",

The planet generally conforms to it's own laws of physics. For example, light travels much slower due to the heavy magical field it must travel through. Also, A'tuin doing flips and twists to dodge/catch asteroids has little affect on it's population, other than to induce severe sea sickness on any late night star gazers.</p><a> </a><h2>The Disc</h2><p>The Disc it's self is roughly two-fifths of Earth's diameter, at 10,000 miles wide. Geometrical Directions are not given as North, South, West and East but as Rimward (towards the edge), Hubward (towards the center), Turnwise (with the Disc's spin) and Widdershins (against the Disc's spin). In the center of the Discworld is a 10 mile high spire of rock known as the Cori Celesti. It is surrounded by the 'Hub', the area surrounding and including the Cori Celesti. The warmer areas of the Disc are those nearest the Rim, seeing as the sun passes closer to there. At the edge of the Rim, a giant waterfall surrounds the Disc constantly. The main city on the Disc is Ankh-Morpork, which is visited at least once in each comic.

        "description":"<a></a><h2>Geography</h2><p>Ankh Morpork was established around 2,500 years before dating began. It is situated on the river Ankh (\"The only river in the world you can draw a chalk outline on\") and is roughly halfway between the rim and the hub. It is situated directly between the Sto Plains and the Circle Sea, giving it an excellent trading position. The river Ankh splits the city in half, Ankh and Morpork. Ankh is the posh part and Morpork is the poor part. Residents often claim that it reduces the risk of barbarian invaders, because they'd need some men ploughing with a shovel in front of the ships. The central part of the city (about 1.6 km across) is still surrounded by the original walls, although many suburbs and farms lie outside the walls.</p><a></a><h2>History</h2><p>One rumour as to the origins of Ankh Morpork is that many centuries ago the Disc flooded, and two of each creature were brought onboard. After 40 days and 40 nights when the storm finished, all the accumilated dung was thrown in a piple and named 'Ankh Morpork'. At one time the city had a large empire, covering half the world including neighbouring Klatch. The empire was ruled over by the greatest leader of all time, General Tacticus. After refusing to accept that his empire was growing too large, he was selected to be the King of Genua. Once there, he decided the biggest threat to Genua was the Ankh Morpork empire and swiftly declared war on and defeated it. Ever since the last King of Ankh was executed by 'Old Stoneface' Vimes (ancestor of the current leader of the Watch) the city has been ruled by Partricians. Although several Patricians were murdered by their second in command the current patrician, Lord Vetinari, has survived by making himself more useful to everyone alive than he would be dead (regardless, the assassains guild's price tag on him is AM$1,000,000).</p><a></a><h2>Guilds</h2><p>The city is ruled over by guilds as well as the recently reformed <a href=\"/ankh-morpork-city-watch/65-47837/\">Ankh Morpork City Watch</a>. Stealing is perfectly acceptable as long as the thief is a member of the thieves guild (although citizens can protect themselves by paying a ceirtan amount of money to the guild each month). Non guild members who are caught stealing are dealt with personally by the guild. There is also an assassains guild who do not murder people, but are a very respectable occupation requiring a lot of training. They would only 'remove' someone if it was for something honourable (i.e. money). There is also a Seamstress' Guild (who's female members do something quite different) and a lawyer's guild to name a few. The two main guilds, the Thieves and Assassains are lead by Mr Boggis and Lord Downey respectfully.</p><a></a><h2>Locations</h2><p>The Mended Drum Originally a brawling tavern (whilst it was called The Broken Drum) the tavern has turned around ever since the fire and attempted insurance fraud.<br /></p><p>Pseudopolois Yard Headquarters of The Watch<br /></p><p>The Shades The poorest part of Morpork<br /></p><p>The Unseen University Headed by Minstrum Ridcully, this magical epicenter of the Discworld includes the library headed by an Ape (but don't call him a monkey) and the 800 foot Tower of Art.<br /></p><a></a><h2>Trivia</h2><p>Insurance was once attempted in Ankh Morpork, but it caused more trouble than it solved as everyone burnt their houses down.<br /></p><p>The Unseen University is technically under a law of it's own.

        "description":"<p>Coast City is the home of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern/12-41148/\">Green Lantern</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a>, located in the state of <a href=\"/california/34-55716/\">California</a>. Coast City is often portrayed as the Los Angeles of the DC universe. Coast City apparently lies approximately twenty miles from <a href=\"/edwards-air-force-base/34-56233/\">Edwards Air Force Base</a>, the location of Hal 's airforce unit and is located between <a href=\"/los-angeles/34-56019/\">Los Angeles</a> and <a href=\"/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a>. Edwards is just one of many air fields and military bases surrounding Coast City , which boasts an equally impressive marina and naval station off of its shores. The private aviation company, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ferris-air/34-55896/\">Ferris Aircraft</a>, once owned by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carl-ferris/29-23245/\">Carl Ferris</a>, has long been tied to and has employed many retired and discharged airmen from Edwards over the years. Hal worked at Ferris for many years as a test pilot, following in the footsteps of his father, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martin-jordan/29-54684/\">Martin Jordan</a>, who died tragically in an explosion of one of Ferris' experimental jets.</p><h3>City of Ruins</h3><p>Months after <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> was killed by the brutal monster <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doomsday/29-9989/\">Doomsday</a>, a giant spaceship engulfed the skies from which rained bombs down upon Coast City, completely devastating the metropolis. Nearly every one of Coast City's seven million residents were killed in the initial blasts, with many survivors falling victim to the high levels of radiation that poisoned the city. The ship was piloted by the alien warlord <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mongul/29-12162/\">Mongul</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyborg-superman/29-12926/\">Cyborg Superman</a>. The duo wiped out Coast City so that they could build a new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warworld/34-56267/\">Warworld</a> where the city once stood. The villains used their advanced science to raise a monstrosity called Engine City out of the ashes of the once iconic town. Many years later, the Cyborg Superman would confess to Hal that he chose to destroy Coast City because that was where his late wife was raised. The destruction of his home and murder of many of his friends, coupled with the stress of battle, led to Hal suffering a mental breakdown. A distraught Green Lantern used his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-power-ring/18-41361/\">power ring</a> to recreate the city as he had remembered it. When his actions drew the ire of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians</a>, who saw this use as an abuse of his power, a mentally exhausted Hal Jordan proved susceptible to the influence of the fear entity known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a>. Jordan left the remains of his home and embarked upon on a nightmarish journey under the possession of Parallax. With the help of several heroes, a memorial was made to honor Coast City 's fallen citizens. When Earth's sun was consumed by a Sun-Eater, Hal/Parallax sacrificed himself to reignite the sun's energy. Afterwards, the heroes buried him in his hometown.</p><h3><b>Coast City Rises Up</b></h3><p>Over time, Coast City was deemed habitable once more. Although large scale construction began, the city remained a ghost town. Stagnant economic development was just a pretense for the real reasons why people were not returning to Coast City . The fear of a second attack, and the uneasiness of living in a city where millions had been murdered, weighed heavily against the prospects of returning to its pre-cataclysm status as a leading city in California . Coast City was only sparsely populated with the majority of its residents comprised of servicemen from Edwards Air Fore Base and the nearby naval station. Among the few civilians that returned w ere Hal's brother, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jim-jordan/29-34890/\">Jim Jordan</a>; Jim's wife <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sue-jordan/29-34891/\">Sue</a>; and their two kids. Jim was moved by Hal's lecture to him about refusing to live in fear. Seeing the emotional toll his overly cautious nature was having on his family, Jim moved them to where his struggling insurance company was one of many businesses floundering in the still vacant city .</p><p>It seemed as if Coast City was destined to remain a ghost town unable to recover from its horrific past. Ironically, the greatest fear haunting Coast City , the return of a second extra-terrestrial attack, was the impetus for its rebirth. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro/29-10448/\">Sinestro</a> and Parallax lead their fear inspired Sinestro Corps to Earth, the villains planned to level Coast City once more, turning it into a holy land of death and fear. With hundreds of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Sinestro Corps</a> soldiers bearing down on the city, Hal Jordan and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a> stood alone against the onslaught. Hal Jordan used his ring to commandeer all television and radio signals, informing the public of the coming invasion and ordering them to evacuate the city. The people of Coast City refused; instead, people from all across the city joined together to cover their lights with green as a show of support. On that terrible night, Coast City burned with the color of their city's champion, the Green Lantern. The city was saved from a second destruction by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a>. Hal Jordan and Kyle Rayner fought hand to hand with Sinestro through the half finished construction that made up the skyline. With a devastating hook to the jaw, Jordan brought Sinestro down and placed his former mentor under arrest.</p><p>With a unified stand against evil, the people of Coast City sent a message to the world that they were safe, they were strong, and their city would endure. Coast City became known as \"The City Without Fear\" and in the wake of its bravery, thousands of men, women, and children flocked to become residents. The Green Lantern Corps stayed on to aid in rebuilding Coast City under the direction of architect and Green Lantern, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-stewart/29-10451/\">John Stewart</a>. Shortly after, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carol-ferris/29-18276/\">Carol Ferris</a> reopened Ferris Aircraft with her new partner, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tom-kalmaku/29-19066/\">Thomas Kalamaku</a>. Although Coast City remains a hub of supernatural and extraterrestrial activity, the city is once again thriving under the watchful protection of her greatest champion, the Green Lantern.</p><h3>City Life</h3><p>Coast City is one of the many metroplei which celebrate Tribute Day, the day <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> came back to life. It has become a national holiday in which people celebrate the good works of superheroes and the superheroes who have fallen in the line of duty. Coast City now has a population of 2,765,321 people. Coast City, once again, became a battleground when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nekron/29-45745/\">Nekron</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-hand/29-31977/\">Black Hand</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scar/29-56693/\">Scar</a> transported the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-lantern-power-battery/18-55899/\">Black Lantern Power Battery</a> to Earth during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-blackest-night/39-55766/\">Blackest Night</a>.</p><h3>Coast City Location</h3><p>Over the years, Coast City has been used as an analogue for both Los Angeles/San Diego and San Francisco/Sacramento (located somewhere between them), simultaneously being 20 miles from Edwards Air Force Base AND 90 miles from Fort Rock, Oregon. Seeing as how many story elements take place at Edwards AFB and the nearby Ferris Aircraft, one would assume Coast City would be in Southern California, even though there is no coastline within 20 miles of the air base. In fact, the closest coastline to the \"real world\" Edwards AFB is approximately 70 miles away. However, with Green Lantern Volume 4, a good case can be made that Coast City is indeed located in Southern California. The first, of course, being the proximity of Edwards AFB; then the use of Barstow, CA in Vol.4's opening story arc; next being the proximity of Palmdale, CA in the following story arc featuring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-hand/29-31977/\">Black Hand</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shark/29-14652/\">the Shark</a>. With its current population, Coast City seems to currently be analogous to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxnard,_California\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxnard</a>- <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventura,_California\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ventura</a> metropolitan area just north of Los Angeles.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Opal is particularly notable for several aspects of its depiction in the second <a href=\"/starman/49-5259/\"> <i>Starman</i></a> series. The original settlement, \"Port o' Souls\", was established by Puritan settler in the early 1700's. In 1884, the town elected Brian \"Scalphunter\" Savage as sheriff; Scalphunter is later reincarnated as Matt O'Dare , and later as <a href=\"/star-boy/29-1260/\"> Star Boy</a>. About the same time the morally ambiguous <a href=\"/shade/29-9362/\">        Shade</a> made Opal City his home.</p> <p>The modern Opal City had its greatest expansion in the 1910s to 1930s, as evidenced by its many Art Deco buildings. An interesting detail is that the city, from its foundations, was heavily tainted with dark magic, first due to the activities of an unholy cult calling themselves the Tuesday Club, which was comprised of Opal's most influential and powerful citizens, from its beginnings as Port O'Souls in the Elizabethan era until Savage killed almost the entire cult the final night of 1899. Savage was killed by the last surviving member, but this man was killed seconds later by Savage's assistant, Carny O'Dare. Little after the foundation of Port O'Souls came the curse of the <a href=\"/black-pirate/29-11241/\">       Black Pirate</a>, binding all souls that ever died in Opal to the earthly plane. The pinnacle of this was Hawksmoor St. John, the architect who planned Opal's great expansion, also a fervent Satanist, who christened several buildings in blood so the lines drawn between them formed a perfect five-pointed star. In the WWII years, a group of Nazi occultists planned to drown Opal into a void dimension, but the ritual was partly stopped by <a href=\"/demon/29-7367/\">      Etrigan</a> and the then Starman<a href=\"/ted-knight/29-9296/\">      Theodore Knight</a>. However, the aftermath of all of this was an atmosphere tremendously saturated in magical power, which <a href=\"/culp/29-11245/\">    Simon Culp</a> sought to use in conjunction with his own augmented power to allow the Nazi ritual to be completed, to destroy what his archenemy <a href=\"/shade/29-9362/\">   Richard Swift, the Shade</a>, loved most. However, Culp was defeated and the souls liberated from the Pirate's curse.</p> <p>It was in 1939 that the first Starman Ted Knight began his career as a superhero. Opal itself at one point in its history suffered very heavy damage, first by explosions leveling several large stores, courtesy of the Infernal Doctor Pip, and later, due to the same man, demolition bombs designed to destroy much larger sections of the city during Culp's attempted destruction of Opal. Additionally, the Post Office/Government building was torn out of its foundations and taken into space by Ted Knight, to protect the city from a nuclear bomb planted deep within it by the Mist. The bomb safely exploded in outer space, and the reconstruction of Opal started.<br /></p> <p><u><strong>Trivia <br /></strong></u></p>Though not specified, consumption of Absinthe may still be legal within Opal City even though it was banned in the United States in 1912.  <p><br /></p>",

        "description":"<a></a><h2>History</h2><p>There is nearly three months of continuous day where the sun doesn't set on Barrow between May 10th and August 2nd.  Conversely, between November 18 and December 17th the sun never rises, resulting in thirty continuous days of night (hence the name of the series).</p><p>The vampire Marlow sought out Barrow for this purpose, realizing that a town so remote could easily be cut off from all contact with the outside world.  With thirty days of continuous night, the Nosferatu would have the span of an entire month to consume the inhabitants.  Uninterrupted, isolated, and without fear of the sun they would not need to sleep, and needed not fear discovery by the outside world.  The massacre that would ensue was finally put to an end by <a href=\"/eben-olemaun/29-47928/\">Eben Olemaun</a>, sacrificed himself by turning himself into a vampire to save his wife <a href=\"/stella-olemaun/29-47982/\">Stella Olemaun</a>.  Eben killed one of the elder vampires, <a href=\"/vicente/29-48404/\">Vicente</a>.  This scared the other vampires, who retreated from Barrow.  During the vampire occupation 443 residents of Barrow were killed, and only 19 residents survived.</p><p>Barrow continued to be plagued by the occasional small vampire attack.  The surviving residents of Barrow would not be taken by surprise again.  They erected a fence around the perimeter of the town with guardtowers along the fence as well as UV floodlights.  Residents possess firearms and explosives, and the town has installed machine-gun turrets in the town.  Barrow would experience the occasional vampire attack periodically, but nothing like the first attack.  Many new residents of the town are relatives of those that were killed during the first attack.   During the annual 30 days of night some residents of Barrow would leave, some would hide until the sun rose again in December, and some chose to stay and take up arms, preparing for the possibility of another attack.</p><p>Three years after the first attack on Barrow, the residents (and protectors) of Barrow noticed a number of vampire scouts popping up before November 18.  Knowing that another attack was impending, the residents of Barrow prepared for the worst.  After the deaths of most of the vampire elders over the course of a few years, vampire society had fallen into somewhat of a chaotic state, and the leadership hierarchy was now uncertain.  The vampire youth were shamed by the defeat at Barrow, subsequent defeats by <a href=\"/stella-olemaun/29-47982/\">Stella Olemaun</a>, and frightened that the living survivors of Barrow could continue to expose their existence.  The next attack planned for Barrow would be to wipe Barrow off the map, killing and burning everything, to redeem themselves ensure their collective survival.</p><p>This time the vampires amassed prepared, and now armed with weapons.  Despite their preparedness for attack, the residents of Barrow that chose to stay through the winter did not expect the vampires to come armed.  Nevertheless, they continued to fight hard for their small Alaskan town.  During the attack vampires and humans alike would witness blurred attacks on vampires, quick enough that it was difficult to tell what was happening until more and more vampires lay dead.  At the end of the battle the vampire forces were left dead.  Two, lone figures lingered in the horizon.  These were once residents <a href=\"/eben-olemaun/29-47928/\">Eben Olemaun</a> and <a href=\"/stella-olemaun/29-47982/\">Stella Olemaun</a> Olemaun who announced their presence as protectors of Barrow.  Eben and Stella swore that they wouldn't let anyone else ever harm the residents of Barrow before fading into the Darkness.</p><a></a><h2>Casualties of Barrow</h2><p>30 Days of Night<br /></p><p><i>This is a list of deaths during the first attack on Barrow.  Because there were over 400 deaths during the first attack on Barrow it is impossible to name all of the characters that died (most were not named in the comic books), so this is a list of the named characters that died.</i><br /></p><p>Humans: <a href=\"/eben-olemaun/29-47928/\">Eben Olemaun</a>, <a href=\"/john-ikos/29-48546/\">John Ikos</a>, <a href=\"/william-kitka/29-48541/\">William Kitka</a>, <a href=\"/gus-lambert/29-48403/\">Gus Lambert</a><br /></p><p>Vampires: <a href=\"/marlow-roderick/29-48402/\">Marlow Roderick</a>, <a href=\"/vicente/29-48404/\">Vicente</a></p><p>Return to Barrow</p><p><i>This is a list of deaths during the second attack on Barrow.</i><br /></p><p>Humans: <br /></p><p>Vampires: <a href=\"/dane/29-48429/\">Dane</a>, <a href=\"/agent-norris/29-48540/\">Agent Norris</a>, <a href=\"/george/29-48485/\">George</a><br /></p><a></a><h2>The Real Barrow</h2><p>Barrow does exist as the Northernmost Settlement in North America, but bears few similarities to the Barrow depicted in the comic.  Unlike the books most buildings in barrow are raised on stilts.  Prolonged periods of night do occur, but are much longer than the 30 days of the book (the periods of continuous night can last for greater than 60 days).  There is little precipitation in Barrow, however the winds that are common to the area do often result in white out conditions similar to those illustrated in the comics.  Also land in barrow is tundra, rather than being covered by ice and snow.</p><p>Barrow is also no where near as isolated as shown in the comics, having much in the way of air traffic year round.</p><a></a><h2>Related Articles</h2><p><a href=\"/30-days-of-night/49-11266/\">30 Days of Night</a><br /></p>",

The entire world, except for the Manarai Mountains, is completely covered in a cityscape of buildings and thousands of levels. The buildings include the domed <a href=\"/senate-building/34-56430/\">Senate Building</a>, the <a href=\"/jedi-temple/34-56425/\">Jedi Temple</a>, the Imperial Palace, and many others - these buildings going through many phases of destruction and rebuilding.</p><p>The weather of Coruscant is controlled by orbital mirrors and satellites, artificially simulating weather conditions, typically maintained at spring-like temperatures.</p><p>After the terraforming of Coruscant by the Yuuzhan Vong, despite attempts at restoration, pieces of the planet were corroded by organic life, covered in ivy and in states of disrepair. This was especially true in the lower levels.</p><h2>History</h2><p>As empires rise and fall, Coruscant has been the throne world for many governments and the center of many galactic conflicts.</p><p>Thousands of years before the Republic and before recorded chronology, ancient Coruscant - before the vast technology - was the place of a struggle between the tribal humans and <a href=\"/taung/65-58482/\">Taungs</a>, with the latter faction forced offworld by the victorious humans.</p><p>Around 30,000 years before the Battle of Yavin (BBY), Coruscant and her inhabitants were enslaved by the <a href=\"/infinite-empire/65-58957/\">Infinite Empire</a>, an advanced race of aliens known as the Rakata that had all but completely conquered the known galaxy. They were wiped out by a virus, retreating to their homeworld of Lehon, mostly dying out there. In their exodus, they left some of their technology behind, including the revolutionary Hyperspace drives, a crucial part of galactic civilization.</p><p>It wasn't until about 5,000 years after the defeat of the Rakata that the Galactic Republic was formed in c. 25,000 BBY. The <a href=\"/old-republic/65-51880/\">Galactic Republic</a> became the main government in the galaxy. The Republic and their sworn ally, the <a href=\"/jedi-order/65-41234/\">Jedi Order</a>, became the primary authority throughout the galaxy.</p><p>In 1,000 BBY, the Republic went through what would be called the Ruusan Reformation, the result of the final battle of the New Sith Wars against the <a href=\"/the-sith/65-44460/\">Sith</a>. The senate was given greater power, not wanting to trust in a single man, namely a Supreme Chancellor. The armies of the Republic were lessened, as was the involvement of the Jedi Order, preventing the Jedi from acting as a military force unto themselves - as they did during the New Sith Wars.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2510617\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41083/2510617-grand_army.jpg\" title=\"Clones being deployed off Coruscant\"><img id=\"2510617\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41083/2510617-grand_army_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Clones being deployed off Coruscant\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Clones being deployed off Coruscant</div></div></div></div><p>In 22 BBY, a new threat consisting of renegade systems separating from the Republic, known as the <a href=\"/confederacy-of-independent-systems/65-51712/\">Confederacy of Independent Systems (CIS)</a> was out to defeat the Republic. The Republic was caught at a disadvantage to meet this threat, with no army to fight for them. However, they found that a clone army had been created under commission from a long-dead Jedi Master, master Sifo Dyas - though in reality, it was ordered by Count Dooku, who was ordered to do so by the Sith Lord, Darth Sidious. This clone army, known as the Grand Army of the Republic, was utilized in the three year fight with the Confederacy in what would be known as the Clone Wars. Near the end of the Clone Wars, Coruscant became the cite of battle, which served only as a diversion to capture Chancellor Palpatine.</p><p>Finally, the Galactic Republic would suffer a killing blow: Palpatine, revealing himself to be Darth Sidious, set string of events that led to the senate becoming distrustful of the Jedi, due to their attempted \"assassination\" of Palpatine. He executed Order 66, which causes clones throughout the galaxy to kill their Jedi commanders. He sent his apprentice, Darth Vader, with the 501st Legion to the very steps of the Jedi Temple, laying siege to the landmark and symbol. Palpatine disbanded the Republic, creating his own Galactic Empire. During the reign of the Empire, Coruscant was often called Imperial Center. Palpatine ruled from Coruscant for decades.</p><p>Many years later, Coruscant came under the control of the <a href=\"/new-republic/65-51084/\">New Republic</a>. They created a Jedi headquarters on the ruins of the destroyed temple for the reformed <a href=\"/new-jedi-order/65-59297/\">New Jedi Order</a>, built from the ashes of the old Order. .</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2510532\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41083/2510532-coruscant_falls_2.jpg\" title=\"Coruscant falls.\"><img id=\"2510532\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41083/2510532-coruscant_falls_2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Coruscant falls.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Coruscant falls.</div></div></div></div><p>In 25 ABY (After the Battle of Yavin, 21 years after the Empire's fall), a new threat came to the galaxy: the <a href=\"/yuuzhan-vong/65-56627/\">Yuuzhan Vong</a>, a race of formidable warriors who consider all things technology to be blasphemous to their deities, utilizing living creatures as weapons and even \"starships\". And so, after the New Republic ignored the Vong until it was far too late, the Vong attacked and conquered Coruscant. This was the first time in galactic history that Coruscant had been invaded and taken over through military force by another faction. The New Republic was effectively disbanded, the New Jedi Order fled Coruscant, and the Yuuzhan Vong claimed victory.</p><p>The Vong terraformed the surface of Coruscant, covering it in plant life and other biological modifications, attempting to convert Coruscant into a new \"Yuuzhan'tar\" (the Yuuzhan Vong homeworld).</p><p>The former members of the New Republic formed the Galactic Alliance, enlisting the help of even more systems, including the Imperial Remnant. They Alliance retook Coruscant, defeating the Yuuzhan Vong. But the damage was done: a lot the surface had been destroyed beyond repair, leaving pieces of the planet in an almost \"mutated\" state of biological and mechanical, especially in the lower levels, which got worse as one went deeper. During this time, the Jedi Temple was also rebuilt.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2510570\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41083/2510570-sith_temple_1.jpg\" title=\"The converted Jedi Temple\"><img id=\"2510570\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41083/2510570-sith_temple_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The converted Jedi Temple\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The converted Jedi Temple</div></div></div></div><p>About a hundred years later, the New Empire - controlled by the Fel bloodline started by Jagged Fel - were manipulated by the <a href=\"/one-sith/65-59205/\">One Sith</a> into engaging in a war with the Galactic Alliance. In the process, they took Coruscant. However, Roan Fel - the Emperor of the New Empire - was betrayed by the One Sith leader, Darth Krayt, who took the throne, forcing Fel and his empire to retreat to Bastion. Thus, the Sith took control once more of Coruscant, converting the rebuilt Jedi Temple into a Sith Temple. Coruscant remained in Sith hands for ten years.</p><p>The New Empire, the remnants of the Galactic Alliance, and the New Jedi Order came together for a final attack. In the process, Darth Krayt is killed, the remaining Sith retreat offworld, and Emperor Roan Fel dies. The result is the formation of the Galactic Federation Triumvirate, consisting of the New Empire, the Galactic Alliance, and the New Jedi Order.</p>",

When the team was trapped in Riverrock for a year the bar was bought by a  flipper-armed conjurer named <a href=\"/eddie-deacon/29-56767/\">         Eddie Deacon</a>. He has the power of telekinesis and could even squeeze a trachea shut.
