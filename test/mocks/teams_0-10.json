        "description":"<h2><b>Origin</b></h2>The nascent Hand first formed about 800 years ago in feudal <a href=\"/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a>, as a reaction to the oppressive class system that characterized Japanese society in that period. A number of Japanese citizens left their homes and settled in the mountains. There, they cultivated skill in ninjutsu, and through rigorous training became experts at assassination and espionage. The group officially came together in 1588 under the command of <a href=\"/kagenobu-yoshioka/29-1798/\">Kagenobu Yoshioka</a>, who turned his samurai school into a bastion of support for the common man. Yoshioka was eventually assassinated, and command of the group co-opted by the <a href=\"/snakeroot/65-56349/\">Snakeroot</a>, an ancient ninja clan who turned the Hand to demon worship and black magic. The Hand began working as mercenaries, and sought to extend its influence throughout the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h2>Creation</h2>The Hand was created by <a href=\"/frank-miller/26-7082/\">Frank Miller</a>. &nbsp;<br /><h2>Team Evolution&nbsp;</h2>The Hand consists largely of unknown masked people, but has featured numerous named characters at various points in its history. Throughout its history various heroes have been press-ganged into service by the dark magic of the Hand. They have also employed numerous villains.<br /><h2>Major Story Arcs&nbsp;</h2><h3>The Chaste &nbsp;</h3>The Hand comes into constant conflict with a heroic group known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"/chaste/65-55828/\">Chaste</a>. This conflict is the first encounter with the Hand experienced by both <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a>, with the latter first infiltrating and later joining the Hand for a time. The conflict eventually results in the defeat of the Hand, but also in the deaths of the Chaste's leader, <a href=\"/stick/29-11018/\">Stick</a>, and a member of the group named <a href=\"/shaft/29-5182/\">Shaft</a>.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Enemy of the State &nbsp;</h3>The Hand, alongside scion organization <a href=\"/hydra/65-3480/\">HYDRA</a> and the mutant group Dawn of the White Light, orchestrates the abduction of <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. They brainwash him, and set him loose, intending to use him as the weapon he was designed to be to kill members of the superhero community. They send numerous operatives out across the world to deal with opponent superheroes, with limited success. They manage to kill and resurrect Elektra and <a href=\"/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a>, both of whom are brainwashed to act as weapons for the Hand and HYDRA. Meanwhile, Wolverine escapes his brainwashing and turns on the Hand, commandeering a <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a> and invading their headquarters, destroying many of the Hand's members, as well as the organization's elite, with the assistance of Elektra, who had also managed to escape her conditioning.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Shadowland</h3>Daredevil takes over command of the Hand after the Hand's repeated attempts to acquire a new warlord. He constructs a new headquarters for them in <a href=\"/hells-kitchen/34-42295/\">Hell's Kitchen</a>, called <a href=\"/shadowland/34-57004/\">Shadowland</a>, and dedicates himself into remodelling the group into a force for good. The group begins to corrupt him instead. After Daredevil kills <a href=\"/bullseye/29-4647/\">Bullseye</a>, he and members of the Hand crash the funeral and engage in a massive brawl which almost results in the death of the captive <a href=\"/ben-urich/29-4799/\">Ben Urich</a>. After a number of clashes between the Hand and the members of the superhero community, it is revealed that Daredevil is possessed by the demonic <a href=\"/the-beast/29-61555/\">Beast of the Hand</a>. He is defeated and apparently kills himself; in the ensuing confusion, control of the Hand is seized by <a href=\"/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> and <a href=\"/typhoid-mary/29-1536/\">Typhoid Mary</a>.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Film &nbsp;</h3><b><i>Elektra</i></b>&nbsp;<br />The Hand appears as a the major antagonistic organization in this film.<br /><h3>Video Games&nbsp;</h3><b><i>X-Men vs Street Fighter&nbsp;</i></b><br />The Hand appears briefly and attempts to draw <a href=\"/cammy/29-42698/\">Cammy</a> into their organization.<br /><b><i>X-Men Origins: Wolverine</i></b>&nbsp;<br />The Hand appears as an antagonistic organization in this game. &nbsp;<br /><b><i>Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3</i></b><br />Members of the Hand appear, as does the Hand's headquarters and Shadowland.&nbsp;<br /><b><i>Marvel: Avengers Alliance&nbsp;</i></b><br />Various members of the Hand appear in this game.&nbsp;",

Soon afterward, the wall of his cell was blown out and he was approached by Cyclops, who presented him with an offer to join the academy. He was given the name Iceman after his power to manipulate moisture and create ice.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Henry \"Hank\" McCoy</a>, born in Dunfee, Illinois to Norton and Edna McCoy was a genius with the brutish look. He excelled in athletics due to his physical nature but also studies profusely. When he began to attract animosity for his appearance and mutation, he was approached by Xavier to join his school. Hank took the name \"Beast\" as his mutation granted him larger hands and feet, much like a gorilla and super strength to match.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Warren Kenneth Worthington III</a> was already a costumed crime fighter in his own right who went by the name \"the Avenging Angel.\" He was born to millionaire parents and was kept in a private school, forced to hide his physical mutation. He was recruited by Professor X and he retained the codename \"Angel\" due to his large feathery wings.</li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> was already a student (of sorts) of Professor X prior to the formation of the X-Men. After experiencing the death of her best friend, Annie, her telepathic powers were activated, forcing the young mutant to feel and sense her friend's passing. She was coached and helped by the Professor as he locks her powers away to keep her safe. As she develops telekinetic gifts she is invited to the school to become the sole female addition to the team. She takes the name \"Marvel Girl.\"</li></ul><p>The students are trained to use their gifts by Professor X who deems them the X-Men due to their extra abilities. The team becomes a tightly knit group, growing up from teenagers and learning to properly use their powers. Their first mission is against the evil mutant, <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, who is the self proclaimed \"Master of Magnetism.\" He attacked Cape Citadel and the X-Men prevented any damage or casualties.</p><p>During the initial run of X-Men they face Magneto's <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, the teleporting <a href=\"/vanisher/29-6756/\">Vanisher</a>, the villainous Factor Three and the alien <a href=\"/lucifer/29-14468/\">Lucifer</a>. Early in the series, Professor X is presumed dead and it is learned that he had been replaced, at his request, by the Changeling, a villain who wished to reform his criminal ways. The X-Men are also joined by the mutant Mimic, who has the ability to utilize up to five mutant abilities at a time. Mimic sought out the X-Men in an attempt to make his powers permanent, but was defeated and became an ally for a short time. The team was then joined by two new recruits; Havok, the plasma generating brother of Cyclops; and Polaris, the green haired, magnetism manipulating future confirmed daughter of Magneto.

Stan Lee created the title 'X-Men' when publisher <a href=\"../../martin-goodman/26-43801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Goodman</a> turned down the original name ' The Merry Mutants' because he felt that people would not understand what a mutant actually was. Throughout the Marvel Universe, it is believed that the X-Men were named after Professor Xavier, their mentor but it is claimed that they were actually named after the X-Gene, the gene that created mutants.</p><p>One of the reasons for creating X-Men was the amount of mail Marvel was getting from the readers demanding a new superhero team because of all the solitary heroes in Marvel roster. Stan Lee wanted the heroes to have similar origin background, and because \"I could not get everyone bitten by radioactive spider\", Lee came up with the \"Homo Superior\" concept.</p><p>Some have pointed out that it is possible that the team was inspired by <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a>' Doom Patrol. At the time <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> was a new force on the comics scene and took a lot of its motivation and inspiration from DC (for instance the Fantastic Four were patterned after the <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown/65-16341/\">Challengers of the Unknown</a>). The similarities between numerous characters, and especially Professor X to <a href=\"/the-chief/29-35126/\">the Chief</a> have led to this speculation.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>The Early Years</h3><p>The Silver and early Bronze ages of comics published stories more in line with the standard at the time, meaning issues that consisted of self contained stories with little overall development of characters. One of the developments of Marvel is that the company became much more interested in character development, but this change was slow and the early years of the X-Men were marred with the same problems as other comics, if perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><h3>Late 70's</h3><h3>Deadly Genesis/Giant-sized X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"13286\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"All New All Different\"><img id=\"13286\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"All New All Different\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">All New All Different</div></div></div></div><p>The first big shake-up for the team came when the original team (plus Havok and Polaris, minus Beast) were abducted by the living island of Krakoa. First Professor X sent a brand new team of untried students trained by <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a>. This team included Kid Vulcan, Darwin, Sway,and Petra, but they were quickly overtaken by the island. Petra and Sway were killed but Vulcan was left in suspended animation (partially due to Darwin's powers). When Krakoa released Cyclops to bring more mutants to feed on, Professor X gathered several young mutants who already had experience in their powers: Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Thunderbird, Sunfire, and Banshee. Due to Professors X's mental manipulations, Vulcan's team was completely forgotten and Storm's team became known as the X-Men second generation. Following this mission, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Havok, and Lorna Dane (as well as Sunfire) all left the team allowing the remaining new members and Cyclops to become the new X-Men.</p><h3>New X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833613\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix Rises\"><img id=\"1833613\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phoenix Rises</div></div></div></div><p>The\nnewly formed team was comprised of diverse but strong personalities, making\nthem very different from the original team. The\nnew team consisted of adults rather than impressionable teenagers, and both Scott and\nXavier found it challenging to get the team to work together. On their second mission, the team battled Count Nefaria, and despite earlier warnings, Thunderbird had sacrificed himself for his teammates, and became the first X-Man to die in the line of duty. Subsequent missions had also put the new team against former X-Men members such as Havok and Lorna Dane (now going by the name of Polaris), who were under the influence of Shi\u2019ar agent Eric the Red, and Kierrok and his N\u2019gari. It was during these early periods that readers got their first glimpses of Moira MacTaggert, <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, and <a href=\"/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a>.</p><p>During a Christmas trip to New York City, the X-Men and Marvel Girl were attacked by <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>, which led to the capture of Jean, Banshee and Wolverine. The remaining X-Men were dispatched to space to save the Starcore space station and their teammates. The team was attacked by Erik the Red, and robot duplicates of the original team along with Havok and Polaris. On the escape back to Earth, the spaceship was badly damaged and could not be piloted through use of auto pilot. After telepathically absorbing the information necessary to pilot\nthe ship from Dr. Peter Corbeau, Marvel Girl volunteered to fly the ship back\nto Earth. She assumed that by creating a psionic shield of telekinetic energy she would be safe, and simultaneously forced Cyclops to sleep as she flew the ship back to Earth. Unfortunately, her body could not handle the strain and she perished. The ship landed in the Hudson Bay with all the X-Men safe, but they could not find Jean. While searching for Jean, she emerged from the river in a completely different costume and a fiery voice, and declared a new identity as the Phoenix. The team was uneasy but grateful that Jean had survived, but they quickly noticed that her powers were much more than they were before. She easily performs feats that she was never able to as Marvel Girl.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Immediately after, the team (except Scott and Charles who were looking after Jean) battled the <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> and Black Tom Cassidy in Ireland, but before they were defeated, Jean as the Phoenix saved them. The team then faced foes such as Magneto, which saw the division among the team, and each side thought that the other had perished; Moses Magnum, who held Japan hostage and cost Banshee his mutant power; Proteus, the reality warping son of Moira MacTaggart who was killed by the soft hearted Colossus. There was also a mission in the Shi\u2019ar galaxy to defeat the mad Emperor D\u2019Ken. Here, the Phoenix the potential of her power by binding the neutron galaxy inside the M\u2019Kraan Crystal.</p><p>Line-up:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/vulcan/29-21233/\">Kid Vulcan</a>, <a href=\"/darwin/29-40600/\">Darwin</a>, <a href=\"/petra/29-40854/\">Petra</a> and <a href=\"/sway/29-40855/\">Sway</a></li><li><a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>, <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a>, <a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a>, <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a>, <a href=\"/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a> and <a href=\"/banshee/29-9708/\">Banshee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../thunderbird/29-2174/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunderbird</a> and <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a> and <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Phoenix</a></li><li><a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a>, <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Phoenix</a></li></ul><h2>Early 80\u2019s</h2><h3>Dark Phoenix</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"154910\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix_super.jpg\" title=\"Dark Phoenix\"><img id=\"154910\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6362/154910-88063-dark-phoenix_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Phoenix\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dark Phoenix</div></div></div></div><p>In one of the most well-known X-Men stories, Jean Grey began to lose control over her powers and personality. She became much more aggressive in dealing with wrong doers. While saving the mutant <a href=\"/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a> from a <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> task force, she completely dismantled a car with ease. During this time, the team had recruited a young mutant from Deerfield, Illinois named Katherine \"Kitty\" Pride. Kitty along with Storm, Colossus and Wolverine are captured by the Hellfire Club and held hostage but was eventually rescued through the efforts of an escaped Kitty and the remaining X-Men. The members of the Hellfire Club's inner circle witnessed a sample of Phoenix's power and plotted on brain washing her into becoming a member. A former member of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, <a href=\"/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, was primarily responsible for the psychic seduction of Jean Grey. He initiated \"time slips\" to convince her that she was living in the past as his lover. Jean goes to the club and became fully entranced under Masterminds mind control. The X-Men attempted to intervene, but it only led to their capture with the exception of Wolverine, who makes a famous stand against the club's security and Inner Circle. Jean eventually overpowered Mastermind, and through the powers of the Phoenix, she put his mind in touch with the universe, which essentially overwhelmed his mind into catatonia. Her actions had caused her to become overwhelmed by her own powers, thus transforming her into the Dark Phoenix.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833617\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833617-831402_dofp_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine and Katherine\"><img id=\"1833617\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833617-831402_dofp_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine and Katherine</div></div></div></div><p>After defeating the X-Men and heading to space where she destroyed a star system, Dark Phoenix returned to Earth. The X-Men had allied with the newly deputized <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, and Beast confronts Jean in an attempt to calm and help her. The teams are quickly defeated, but Professor X, aided with the help of Jean Grey, defeated the Phoenix persona. Once he won, the X-Men were interrupted by Lilandra and the Shi'ar imperial guard. As empress, Lilandra is bound by Shi'ar laws to kill the Phoenix for the crimes she had committed against their empire, which was the \"eating\" of a star, and condemning a planetary system in death. The team is transported to the Blue Area of the Moon and Xavier reads Lilandra's mind and invokes Arin'n Haelar, a duel of honor that cannot be denied. The X-Men face off against the Imperial Guard of the Shi'ar. Once the X-Men are defeated, Jean lost control of her powers and personality, and the Dark Phoenix persona arises. Before Lilandra could order the destruction of the solar system to prevent Phoenix from becoming a threat again, Professor X instructed the X-Men to subdue Jean. Once she regained her senses, Jean used a Kree weapon to commit suicide.</p><h3>Days of Future Past</h3><p>With the death of Jean Grey, Cyclops left the team and Angel returned. Professor X promoted Storm to team leader and they welcomed Kitty Pride, now codenamed Sprite, onto the team. In an attempt to deter an assassination plot on <a href=\"/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Kelly</a> by Mystique's Brotherhood of Mutants, Kitty's psyche had switched with that of an alternate time line. In that time line, the world is ruled by Sentinels, and mutants were sent to internment camps and killed. Most of the known X-Men at the time had perished with the exception of Colossus, Storm, Wolverine and Magneto. They were joined with the son of <a href=\"/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>, and the daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey, <a href=\"/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a>. In order to prevent the apocalyptic future, Kitty traveled back to the past to prevent the death of Senator Kelly. She is successful, however, the alternate time line that she had encountered remained intact.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833618\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833618-663504_1_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The Brood\"><img id=\"1833618\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833618-663504_1_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Brood\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Brood</div></div></div></div><p>The next few months are tumultuous for the X-Men.

The X-Men, along with house guest <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a>, traveled to space with the Starjammers and were kidnapped by Lilandra\u2019s sister <a href=\"/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a> and the terrifying <a href=\"/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a>. This lead to Danvers being transformed into the cosmically powered Binary and the X-Men almost being transformed into Brood creatures themselves. The X-Men returned to Earth to destroy the Brood embryo inside Professor X and discover that in their absence, the Professor has gathered a new group of young mutants, the New Mutants. Kitty was briefly demoted to the junior team until she proved herself against a Sidri Hunter on her own.</p><h3><b>Morlocks</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\"><img id=\"1833621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Callisto and the Morlocks</div></div></div></div><p>The X-Men discovered that Angel had been kidnapped by a community of underground dwelling mutants calling themselves <a href=\"/morlocks/65-3191/\">Morlocks</a> and led by a fierce woman named <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a>.

During their stay in Japan, Storm spends time with a thief, <a href=\"/yukio/29-9843/\">Yukio</a>, and sees drastic changes to her looks and personality. She adopts a more punk look, cutting her incredibly long hair into a Mohawk and wearing leather and spikes. Combined with her Morlock vest, it is a vast change from her previous looks and temperament. During this time, Storm was rendered powerless by <a href=\"/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a>, who shot her with a gun used to suppress mutant gene's when aiming for her foster daughter, Rogue.</p><h3>The Summers Family Expands</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"808196\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/808196-madelyne_pryor1_super.jpg\" title=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\"><img id=\"808196\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/808196-madelyne_pryor1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Scott and Madelyne get married!</div></div></div></div><p>Around this same time, Scott married a woman named <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> who was the spitting image of Jean Grey.

He was slowly on the path to dying and refused to burden his students with it. At this point, he also invited Magneto to stay at the mansion with them as he had begun to repent for his past misdeeds. Also at this time, it was decided that Storm and Cyclops could no longer share the leadership responsibilities and there must be a decision made.

The <a href=\"../../legacy-virus/12-42281/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus</a> was a disease that attacked only mutants and caused their powers to become powerfully out of control to a fatal end. The virus hit close to home with mutants suffering that had close ties to the X-Men like Pyro, <a href=\"../../revanche/29-9709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Revanche</a> and Colossus' young sister Illyana Rasputin. Illyana, who had been reverted to childhood following the events of the Inferno, was still a latent mutant in her current form and was the first casualty of the virus. It hit Colossus hard as he had just lost both of his parents soon before. The X-Men held a vigil in her honor with all X-Teams in attendance to mourn her death. Wishing to pay his respects and offer asylum to any and all mutants interested, Magneto crashed the funeral in a show of misplaced aggression. He attacked the X-Teams and if not for the intervention of Colossus, would have lost.

In one of the most shocking moments in comic history, he aggressively fights Wolverine and rips out his adamantium skeleton. The Professor decides that enough is enough and his former friend cannot be saved and wipes his mind. Jean Grey then takes over leadership and forces the team back to the craft while keeping the Professor breathing and Wolverine alive. In the end, Wolverine is left in a feral state with very little active healing ability and unsure of his life and purpose.</p><p>With the Acolytes now in a power struggle, <a href=\"../../fabian-cortez/29-9728/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabian Cortez</a> assumes leadership over Magneto's followers. He kidnaps Magneto's granddaughter and daughter to Quicksilver and the Avenger, <a href=\"../../crystal/29-2115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal</a> and claims her in the name of Magneto. This enrages the Avengers and the X-Men who join forces to save <a href=\"/luna/29-10962/\">Luna</a> and take back Genosha.

Later while fighting Sentinels the team recruited Iceman. The Brotherhood of Mutants sent a spy to infiltrate the X-Men group to kill Professor X. They sent Wolverine. Magneto, The Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, <a href=\"../../toad/29-1470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toad</a>, Multiple Man, the <a href=\"../../blob/29-3182/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blob</a> and Mastermind form the Brotherhood and they had kidnapped the President\u00b4s daughter. The X-Men saved her and in the last moment Wolverine had a change of heart and instead of killing Xavier he tried to kill Magneto, while he sent Sentinels to kill humans. In the end Xavier killed Magneto with the help of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.</p><p>Xavier then started helping Wolverine to find out where were the people who gave him the metal implants. <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-50418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a> did all the implants and they found it. Then the X-Men were abducted by Weapon X and were tortured and they even made Beast blue.</p><p>Ultimate <a href=\"../../alpha-flight/65-14616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Flight</a> arrived and seemingly kill Iceman and now the X-Men face these strange super powered team. Beast puts Iceman back together but Alpha Flight arrive to take Northstar, something that Colossus isn't very happy about. Alpha Flight was under the influence of a power enhancing drug called <a href=\"../../banshee/18-55849/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a>. Taking <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a> had Colossus so mad Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Rouge and him went after Alpha Flight. Cyclops went along to prevent anything stupid from happening. The <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a> appeared into the picture and caused the death of Northstar. Colossus and the rest of the people who went along went under Banshee drug and enhanced their powers. Dazzler could maneuver her powers to create anything, Rouge could keep the power she absorbed, Nightcrawler could go to greater lengths, Colossus became stronger, and Cyclops could control his eye beams and fly.</p><p>Jean Grey had taken it into her own hands to lead the X-Men and she was driving them around pretty hard. Nightcrawler contacted her saying that they needed help from themselves because they were addicted to the power enhancer. Wolverine had figured out that he was positive to have been dosed with Banshee so he went to <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker</a> for help to sort things out. Kitty and Peter were dealing with Banshee addicts themselves when Wolverine arrived. Peter explained that he was positive because he was Banshee the drug was made by taking properties of him. The X-Men went after the addicted X-Men and fought it off. Jean went off for a moment while she talked to her father as Phoenix when then she fell unconscious. Logan blamed Colossus for it so he took his heart out for it.</p><p>Both X-Men embark on a flight until Phoenix stops it all. Everyone cools down for the exception of Cyclops that flies to the moon. During the fight Wolverine looses a leg to Colossus. Phoenix show to Colossus that Northstar is okay except that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Colossus and Wolverine are fixed up by Jean after that and then Jean heads to the moon. Wolverine using some of the Banshee Colossus bought he tracked it down to Muir Island blaming Xavier for it. Jean talked to Scott and after that he said he wanted to keep the power the Banshee started wearing off so she put his glasses back on. The Prof. was who created Banshee from Wolverine along with Magneto but Moira distributed it. She fought Wolverine with her \"Screaming\" powers. In the end Wolverine destroyed the whole facility. Quicksilver then arrived an told Moira that Magneto had newer plans for the near future.</p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Rogue and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"../../ultimatum/39-55745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards. Then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a Sentinel from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverine Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually Scott. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over as Captain America after <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Rogers</a> aged 100 years, then he died. In the future Iceman was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be <a href=\"../../human-torch/29-2120/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny</a> he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"../../liz-allan/29-15408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops\u00b4s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. <a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben</a> and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue\u00b4s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother\u00b4s death. Everyone let the future hero\u00b4s free from a prison in the <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Negative Zone</a> Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-Men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that, that future would not happen.</p><p>In <a href=\"../../ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimate X-Men</a> #100 we find that The Academy of Tomorrow has been attacked by Madrox on behalf of Magneto. There are several multiples of Madrox with bombs strapped to their chest and when the Cyclops, Iceman and Rogue arrive the school is in flames and Northstar and Polaris are shown as dead.

Professor Xavier believes sociopath is the next step in human evolution. The X-Men are framed for killing their own member Jean Grey by way of three cuts over the back and face. Leader of the police force known as \" <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Brotherhood</a>\" named <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnus</a> is put in charge of the investigation. As the search for the X-Men continues more and more of them are found dead.

When he tells them to go to the police Scott responds. \"We're the X-Men, and no one is on our side\". Meanwhile a mysterious man in a bright red cape is investigating the crimes himself. After Warren Worthington is thrown from a roof top and Hank McCoy is shot and killed in a run in with The Brotherhood, Magnus orders the Brotherhood to take down <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a> (a powerful mob boss) and his Hellfire Club. Magnus believes with the X-Men out of his way and the Hellfire club killed off, the city will be \"his\". He meets with <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anne-Marie Rankin</a> to learn the whereabouts of the last few X-Men but she kills him instead. The caped figure later realizes that Jean Grey is not dead. What happened was that she killed Anne-Marie Rankin and took her place, because she wanted to avoid being studied by Xavier or exploited by Magnus. She then says she knows that the caped figure cannot kill her and pulls a gun on him but he then reveals that he is the twin brother of who she thinks he is and then pushes her off the roof causing them both to fall to their death. His twin, accompanied by Scott finds their bodies and says that he lost him years ago by what he had become. He recants about how when he and his brother both worked at a prison they started the whole cape thing because it made the inmates think he was in two places at the same time (making it seem like he has super powers).

There have also been rumors of an X-Men 4, Deadpool, and a New Mutants film. The films are loosely based on stories told in the comic books, and often focus on the same issues.

It is part of a tunnel system which extends into New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York state. <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a> first found the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> who had the power to psionically locate other mutants. Using <a href=\"/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> ability, <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a> located and gathered together many other mutants who had run away from human society. Many had been experiments of the evil geneticist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a> who arrived in this time-line from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a>, where he had worked under his reality's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>. &nbsp;The other founding members of the Morlocks include <a href=\"/masque/29-7252/\">Masque</a> who can rearrange a persons looks, and <a href=\"/sunder/29-7969/\">Sunder</a> the strongest of the initial group of Morlocks. Callisto herself not without a sense of humor named the loose knit group the Morlocks, after the&nbsp;H. G. Wells novel The Time Machine. Morlock's aren't always unified or even limited to New York, as their have been several splinter Morlock groups and groups of disaffected mutants from across the globe have adopted the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Creation</h2>The Morlocks are a <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel comics</a> creation and name given to an underground group of mutants who are disaffected and feel shunned by society. The Morlocks were created by writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont </a>and artist <a href=\"/paul-smith/26-2463/\">Paul Smith,</a> first appearing in&nbsp;<a href=\"/uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">Uncanny X-Men #169.</a> Their name is inspired by the&nbsp;<a href=\"/h-g-wells/26-60130/\">H. G. Wells</a> novel The Time Machine, which also features a similar group of underground beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Team Evolution</h2>There have been various Morlocks over time, often with multiple groups, coexisting alongside each other, with some groups membership swelling as others dwindle or vice versa. One of the first distinctions among the Morlocks, was with one group, the Tunnelers, who had grown dissatisfied with Callisto's main group of Morlocks, so splintered off. These Tunnelers&nbsp;consisting of Masque, <a href=\"/blow-hard/29-14474/\">Blow Hard,</a> <a href=\"/scaleface/29-12641/\">Scaleface,</a> and <a href=\"/berserker/29-36125/\">Berserker.</a> They lived in the underground tunnel section.

        "description":"<p>There have been several groups of mutant youths that have utilized the name the Hellions. The Hellions were/are in most cases the antithesis to the junior X-teams such as: the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/generation-x/65-15083/\">Generation X</a>, the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> and most recently the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> squad by the same name as the original, the New Mutants.</p><h2>The Original Hellions</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> began his quest to put together his second generation team of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, later dubbed the New Mutants. Initially, being that Xavier Institute was a school, it was simply a means to train young mutants in the use and responsibility of their powers. It evolved into becoming training grounds to become field trained and X-Men ready. The design was simple, in the event that the X-Men were not able to perform the New Mutants would fill the spot, which they eventually did. Unbeknown to Xavier, an organization caught wind of his activities and followed quickly after.This group was better known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>. The Hellfire Club is a sinister international group of the world's social elite. They are run by mutants that consider themselves superior to other mutants, in both their mutant abilities/powers and social status. They copied Xavier's design perfectly. They even had their own telepath, quite powerful at that, to front and run the school, by the name of Emma Frost then known as the White Queen.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"101511\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/101511-2979-hellions_super.jpg\" title=\"Original Hellions Additional members\"><img id=\"101511\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/101511-2979-hellions_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Original Hellions Additional members\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Original Hellions Additional members</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, the White Queen of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle, funded and purchased a private school in the Snow Valley, located in the Burkshire Mountains in Massachusetts. She named the private school, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/massachusetts-academy/34-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a>. She was the headmistress of the school, and it was here that she would train her future Hellions. Her intentions for the Hellions were, when fully trained, they would serve the interest of the Hellfire Club's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-inner-circle/29-34656/\">The Inner Circle</a>.</p><p>The Inner Circle seeks to amass absolute power and control, over all things political and economical, through both legal and illegal activities, any means necessary. The Hellions were to be the \"any means necessary.\" As such, Emma needed to seek out and recruit very specific mutants, with abilities that would further aid her organization and later herself. (As a note, Emma didn't truly do it all for the Hellfire Club. She did it to solidify her power in the club. For to mold and control the students, would mean she would control the future.) Her problem was that she couldn't let anyone get to them before her, especially Xavier. It was then that Emma had a computer, very similar to the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a>, created to amplify her mental talents. Once done, her search would begin. Once she located her potential students, she mentally hid their presence from all others until she could recruit them herself. In the order of the students acceptance of Emma's invitation to the academy:</p><ul><li>James Proudstar - Thunderbird (now known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warpath/29-2158/\">Warpath</a>): James was the younger brother of the X-Men <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a>. Super strong and durable he was the muscle of the team. His hatred for Xavier and the X-Men, as he blamed them for his brother's death and wanted revenge, only solidified his role on the team. His time with the Hellions would be limited. James would have a change of heart and eventually quit.</li><li>Sharon Smith - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/catseye/29-2138/\">Catseye</a>: The Hellions answer to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>. Catseye's youth and lack of sophistication belie a ferocious intelligence. Even more ferocious was she when fighting. Like Wolfsbane, Catseye was a metamorph though not into a wolf but into a cat. Catseye could morph into a lavender panther-like wildcat OR a transitional hybrid form granting her the best qualities of both a human and cat. Fiercely loyal she protected her friends to no end. But in reality she hardly understood the normal world prefer the life of a cat.</li><li>Emmanuel Alfonso Rodrigo De la Rocha - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empath/29-2173/\">Empath</a>: Empath was more like the White Queen then any other on the team. He was ruthless, cunning and willing to use his powers on anyone for personal gain. Empath's power (just like his name) was the ability to read, feel and control the emotions of others. He is able to perform this feat on individuals singly or on the city-wide level. Empath was one of Frost's favorites due to their similarities, also one of her biggest pains for the same reason. Empath would be the only member of the Hellions, actually present during their final battle with Fitzroy, to survive and leave the night unscathed. Due, largely in part, to his quick retreat once the Sentinel began their invade.</li><li>Haroum ibn Sallah al-Rashid - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jetstream/29-2143/\">Jetstream</a>: Jetstream shared powers and responsibilities similar to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, who could also propel himself through the air and was also team leader. Though, he didn't share his protective force field Cannonball generated during flight. Jetstream's body didn't have built in protections from the effects of his powers. When Jetstream would lift off the friction and force of the wind that he would fly through would flay his flesh and also cause severe burns or even catch him on fire. The Hellfire Club would remedy this and provide Jetstream with a bionic system that enabled more control, focus and protection from his powers. As a result, he pledged undying lifelong loyalty to them.</li><li>Jennifer Stavros - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roulette/29-2142/\">Roulette</a>: Born to a casino Poker card dealer in Atlantic City. She is the youngest of 8 children, because of this she never had her way. When her mutant gifts manifested things changed. She began running with a gang and breaking the law. She would surely have been arrested before being recruited as part of the Hellions. Roulette could alter the probability fields of good and bad luck. By creating discs of mental energy (red disc was good luck, black disc was bad luck) and throwing them at an individual or thing and action would always follow, depending on which disc she threw.</li><li>Marie-Ange Colbert - <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarot/29-2140/\">Tarot</a>: Unlike some of her other more mean spirited teammates, Tarot was generally sympathetic and kind by nature. Tarot is a precog, with the ability to materialize and animate (purely of psionic energy) tangible, solid representation of the images on her tarot cards. Once created, she had full control of them and they would do battle for her or be used as a transportation device for the team. Her future was to be surrounded in mystery, and more lasting then many of the other Hellion teammates.</li></ul><p>With the final member's acceptance of the White Queen's invitation to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/massachusetts-academy/34-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a>, Emma's search would be over. These young mutants would represent the initial core group, The Hellions.</p><h2>Additional Members</h2><p>Others would join to replace members that would leave, or some would be added as ploys. These individuals included:</p><ul><li>The Fiery, on again, off again New Mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a> (Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla).</li><li>The Bio-electrically charged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bevatron/29-2141/\">Bevatron</a> (Fabian Marechal-Julbin) would fill the slot Firestar would leave open.</li><li>The super strong, not so smart <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beef/29-2139/\">Beef</a> (Buford Wilson) would fill Thunderbird's eventual slot.</li><li>One other individual was offered a spot on the team but declined (revealed a lot later in the Marvel Continuity). Older brother of future X-Force member <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jesse-bedlam/29-15329/\">Jesse Bedlam</a>/Aaronson, Christopher Terrance Bedlam/Aaronson, later known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-bedlam/29-15576/\">King Bedlam</a>. King Bedlam was gifted with the mutant talent to create telepathic static which could control bodily or mental functions, this gave him immunity to mental tampering. When he declined, tried as she might, not even Emma's telepathic persuasion could change his mind. And she tried HARD. Emma didn't take kindly to the word \"No.\" His short time with the team, while making his decision, led to a strong emotional tie with Tarot. They fell in love quickly and, in a still unclear way, the two lovers' souls somehow inextricably became bound together. This would lead to Tarot's later resurrection.</li><li>Finally there was the microwave manipulating, future Avenger <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a> (Angelica Jones). Emma never had intentions for Firestar to join or be apart of the main group. Emma along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, a time traveling mutant from the future, trained her separately and hidden from the others. Firestar was to be the White Queen's personal assassin due to Firestar's destructive and devastating nature of her mutant abilities. Her first mission was to, but never happened, kill the Black Queen of the Hellfire Club (at that time it was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/selene/29-2176/\">Selene</a>) who Emma felt threatened by. This was all for naught as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">New Warriors</a> interfered and won the freedom of Firestar, and she joined them instead.</li></ul><h2>The Hellions Were Formed</h2><p>This group of Hellions were together for years, and built a bond that only time could create. They would do battle with many of Marvel's heroes. Though they were created to battle and be enemies with the New Mutants. Through time it simply turned into something similar to a high school rivalry. The Hellions became more then a team, they were a family that most of them were deprived in their normal lives. Unfortunately, all this would be destroyed in one night.</p><p>As a means to lower tension between the X-Men and the Hellfire Club, Emma threw a party and invited the X-Men (the Gold team led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>). Many of the Hellfire Club's Inner Circle were being murdered and Emma felt that if they were targets that the X-Men wouldn't be too far from being the next targets. She wanted the teams to create an alliance, as she felt there was strength in numbers. Animosity between the two teams raged. Old rivalries, coupled with the immaturity of the Hellions egging the X-Men on led to a small skirmish that was quickly brought a halt when two (though at the time they could only see one, the other was using a cloaking device) unknown assailants broke in an attempted to assassinate the Emma. The female assassin immediately lunged at Emma. Emma far too quick, used a telepathic blast to take down her would-be attacker. While the teams regrouped and tried to question the girl/assassin, another attack began, though they had no clue from where. Even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey's</a> and Emma's vaunted telepathic gifts didn't register the second person. It was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, the one time partner of Emma, had returned but now he was there to kill Emma, not to help her. He was apart of the group of individuals called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/upstarts/65-9727/\">Upstarts</a> who were killing the members of the Inner Circle to gain points. The female attacker was sent in as a ploy to get the teams attention. Within the initial 20 seconds of his appearance he had already killed both Jetstream and Beef. Draining Jetstream of his life and throwing Beef out of the window of the skyscraper they were in, landing on the street, dead on impact. The combined forces of the X-Men and remaining Hellions eventually subdued Fitzroy, then another part of his plan unraveled. A huge teleportation gate opens with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">Donald Pierce</a>, also of the Hellfire Club, running through it with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a> following. The gate closes and a blood bath ensues. The Sentinels immediately head for Emma, apparently dealing her a killing strike. Empath tries to use his powers to see if she was alive, and runs when he finds that she was dead, or so he thought. The Sentinels decimate most of the Hellions and the X-Men barely get out with their lives. The remaining living Hellions, that didn't die in the fight, would have their life forces drained by Fitzroy, ultimately killing them, so he can open a temporal gate for his teammates to come through.</p><p>Those who were killed in the melee were: Jetstream, Beef, Bevatron, Roulette, Catseye and Tarot. As a side note, at the party there were approximately fifteen other Hellions that are shown but never given a name. It's assumed that Emma had recruited others but were not a part of the main team. They may not have had powers suited for battle, though this is never touched on. What is clear is that all the un-named Hellions would, too, have the life forces drained by Fitzroy. Though it seemed as if Emma was given a mortal blow, she actually did not die, but was put into a coma. When she awakens from her coma, she is informed of the death of her students. Grief-stricken and feeling completely responsible for their deaths, something changed in her. Unknown by all, Emma, over the years, grew to love and care for her students, her team of Hellions. The guilt over her loss would lead to her eventual reform. Tarot's story, too, was not over yet either. She is shown later in the page of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> alive. Tarot would be resurrected, due to her bond with King Bedlam. To be explained in New Hellions section. Other survivors (either because they were not apart of the team or left before the final battle) included: Thunderbird, Empath, Magma and Firestar (although not officially a member).</p><p>Additionally, it was noted in one of the Marvel Handbooks that a come of the New Mutants were members of the Hellions as well. A team of New Mutants were killed then resurrected by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beyonder/29-10300/\">Beyonder</a>. When they were brought to like they were mere husks of their former selves. They showed no emotion, being that their deaths affected their psyches greatly. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> was, at that time, the headmaster at Xavier Institute and also the White King of the Hellfire Club. He made the decision to send the affect students to Emma so that she could provide telepathic therapy to the students. While there, they were enrolled into the Massachusetts Academy and inducted as members of the Hellions, even participating in team training activities. This led to friendship being built between the team. They were: Cannonball, Douglas \"Doug\" Ramsey (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Cypher</a>), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> (then Magik), Rahne Sinclair (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>), X'ian Coy Mahn (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>) and Amara Juliana Olivians Aquilla (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>).</p><p>Once cured of their ailments they quickly returned to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a> as it would be revealed that Magneto's decision to transfer his students was actually due to mental tampering from Empath. All would return save Magma who chose (or so she thought, later revealed to be manipulated by Empath's powers) to stay behind and remained with the Hellions.</p><h2>Original Team Stats</h2><p><b>Former Members:</b></p><p>Empath, Roulette, Thunderbird ll, Catseye, Tarot, Jetstream, Bevatron, Beef, Magma, Cannonball, Karma, Cypher, Wolfsbane &amp; Firestar (unofficial)</p><p><b>Base of Operations:</b></p><p>Massachusetts Academy</p><p><b>First Appearance:</b></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-new-mutants/49-3234/\">New Mutants</a> (vol.1) #16</p><h2>Emplate's Hellions</h2><p>The second group of \"Hellions\" was never truly an official incarnation of the Hellions.

This group consisted of some original members of the Hellions, some new ones and one that declined membership to the original group. The exploits of this team was limited to the few appearances that they made in X-Force. As a team their first and largest ploy was when they decided that they was to obtain and control a cryogenically frozen mutant known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/armageddon-man/29-15573/\">Armageddon Man</a>, a mutant of immense and immeasurable might. He was also was one of the earliest recorded mutants ever known. Once controlled they were to use him as a weapon against the government to blackmail them for a million dollars. Their team though would fall apart at the seams and have seen two of their force see the error of their ways and turn against their team. These two would aid X-Force and would see the tides turn That person being <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-bedlam/29-15576/\">King Bedlam</a>, who was also the one that organized and led the group. The New Hellions would swiftly be defeated and for the most part to be seen again in the Marvel Universe, neither as a team or singly. The team was organized by King Bedlam, he gathered together:</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarot/29-2140/\">Tarot</a>: King Bedlam's girlfriend \"apparently\" resurrected. Similar but very different at the same time. Tarot has show mastery over her powers and improved usage of them as well. She is now able to take on the strengths of the tarot cards she wields. Such as assuming the death card she wears a black cloak and fights with a scythe (it never details if she could truly kill anyone with a touch of the scythe or if it simply acts as a weapon). This allows her to take a more active role in battle and makes her for effective physically.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>: The fiery Nova Roman would also resurfaced in the New Hellions, once a New Mutant, now apparently working for the bad side.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/feral/29-2160/\">Feral</a>: One time member of X-Force, her appearance is bitter sweet as she does battle with her ex-teammates.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradigm/29-15574/\">Paradigm</a>: A mutant techno-path infused with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/techno-organic/12-43631/\">Techno-Organic</a> matter extracted from the alien Phalanx.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/switch/29-15575/\">Switch</a>: A newcomer, with mutant mind swapping powers allowing him to mentally swap his mind with another allowing him to control their body.</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jesse-bedlam/29-15329/\">Jesse Bedlam</a>: Jesse would briefly join his brother's team as well but quickly switches back to X-Force when he sees the error in his ways.</li></ul><h2>New Team Stats</h2><p><b>Former Members:</b></p><p>King Bedlam, Tarot, Magma, Feral, Switch, Paradigm &amp; Jesse Bedlam/Aaronson (King Bedlam's brother).</p><p><b>Base of Operations:</b></p><p>Mobile.</p><p><b>First appearance:</b></p><p>X-Force (vol. 1) #87</p><h2>the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\"><b>Xavier Institute</b></a>'s Hellions Squad</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76977\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76977-29469-hellions_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"76977\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76977-29469-hellions_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The last group to use the \"Hellions\" moniker thus far does so as a nod to the original team.

These squads would have one of the senior staffers assigned to them as an advisor, and each group would range from 5-6 mutants each. One such squad consisted initially with:</p><ul><li>Julian Keller (later assuming the codename <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a>): Squad leader and high level telekinetic.</li><li>Cessily Kincaid (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mercury/29-15078/\">Mercury</a>): Mutant with a malleable mercury form.</li><li>Santos Vaccarro (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide</a>): With super strength and composition of rock, he was the powerhouse of the team.</li><li>Sooraya Qadir (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dust/29-4555/\">Dust</a>): Able to transform into a living sandstorm.</li><li>Dallas Gibson (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/specter/29-41699/\">Specter</a>): Could merge with his shadow and take on a new super powered single form.</li><li>Josh \"Jay\" Gutherie (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Icarus</a>): Red winged younger brother of both Cannonball and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/husk/29-3426/\">Husk</a> with powers very similar to that of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>.</li><li>Brian Cruz (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tag/29-40539/\">Tag</a>): Limited psychic, able to compel and repel sentient beings.</li><li>Kevin Ford (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wither/29-40511/\">Wither</a>): A mutant with a decaying death touch.</li></ul><p>The Hellions Squad were a one of the prominent squads at the Xavier Institute and won the first Field Day competition.

A majority of the original team is still here including: Tarot, Roulette, Catseye, Jetstream, Beef and Bevatron.</p><p>After the fall of their High Lord Apocalypse, Magneto attempts to smooth over things with base-line humans and their governing council. The agreed upon solution was that Magneto and his X-Men were to apprehend all rogue followers of the, now dead, evil ruler, Apocalypse. The very first mission for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> and his X-Men is to capture the Hellions and bring them to the authorities to have them pay for the crimes they have committed.

As anyone might surmise from those four words, Simon Utrecht craved POWER and it wasn't enough that he had already acquired millions of dollars, being a serious industrial competitor of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> and having held political office, he wanted more! He wanted the might of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> and was willing to put his fortune on the line as well as his life and the lives of his three companions to obtain that power, sailing them right into the heart of a Cosmic Storm.</p><p>Tapping the knowledge of , Life-Support Specialist, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vapor/29-6790/\">Ann Darnell</a> and her brother, Fuel Propulsion Engineer, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-ray/29-6822/\">Jimmy Darnell</a>, Utrecht goads Mike Steel into flying the ship. The Dynamic is now complete with four members ready to set sail to limitless power.</p><p>The sound of the rocket's propulsion wakens <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Bruce Banner</a> from his crater bed in the near by desert area, where he had been left by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> after reentering earths atmosphere. Deducing that the rocket configuration and trajectory could only mean space flight, Banner rushed to the mission control room to discover that the ship is headed straight for a cosmic storm, instruments reading radiation levels off the chart. Fearing for their safety Banner reprograms the flight control computer to bring them back before they are killed by radiation poisoning.</p><p>The occupants are bathed in the cosmic radiation, each of them experiencing something unique. Mike expresses that it feels as thought the weight of the ship were on his shoulders, his body somehow bonding with the ships alloy. Jimmy states that he feels aglow with power. Ann melds with the life support systems and Simon is overwhelmed by a mass of data somehow connected to the ships computers, as if he were vectoring towards the stars themselves. The Rocket returns crashing to earth with such a crushing explosion that Banner fears nothing could have survived the impact.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"555951\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555951-hulk254_09b_super.jpg\" title=\"U-Foes Emerge\"><img id=\"555951\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555951-hulk254_09b_medium.jpg\" alt=\"U-Foes Emerge\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">U-Foes Emerge</div></div></div></div><p>Much to Banner's surprise, four beings emerge from the wreckage with incredible powers.</p><p><b>Vector:</b> (Simon Utrecht) has the ability to vector/repel any object no matter it's weight size or density.</p><p><b>Vapor:</b> (Ann Darnell) Exhibits the ability to change her form into any gaseous mixture she imagines.</p><p><b>X-Ray:</b> (Jimmy Darnell) Commands radiation of all classifications and can project them offensively.</p><p><b>Ironclad:</b> (Mike Steel) Emerges with a metallic hide, the ability to control his density and Hulk class strength.</p><p>Immediately the quartet blame Banner for robbing them of even greater power by having brought them back too early. Banner is shocked by the revelation that they would expose themselves to dangerous levels of radiation intentionally, to which Simon Utrecht replies, \"You make it sound as if it were madness to seek after power! Perhaps it is when the quest ends in failure. But we have attained the power which we sought!\"</p><p>While pummeling Banner and continuing the blame game, Ironclad uses his cosmic irradiated logic to title the quartet the U-Foes. The <u><b>\"U\"</b></u> stands for Utrecht, who \"engineered the Voyage to the edge of Sanity!\" and <u><b>\"Foes\"</b></u> to signify the teams defiance of Humanity now that they are mighty and something greater than human.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"555952\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555952-namingconvention_super.jpg\" title=\"The Naming Convention!\"><img id=\"555952\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26147/555952-namingconvention_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Naming Convention!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Naming Convention!</div></div></div></div><p>Incurring the wrath of the Hulk, the U-Foes battle clumsily as their powers are new to them and the team dynamic is something far less than \"dynamic\". Each member demonstrates a level of selfishness while trying to work as a team, catching Ironclad in friendly fire. While having the ability to defeat the giant green brute, ultimately the U-Foes end up defeating themselves as their increasing powers get the better of them, becoming uncontrollable. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vapor/29-6790/\">Vapor</a> unable to maintain her atomic structure dissipates into the air. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vector/29-6820/\">Vector</a> suffocates himself as he unwillingly pushes away even the smallest air molecule and pushes himself away from the earth into the outer atmosphere. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-ray/29-6822/\">X-Ray</a> is unable to control the radiation combination, explodes in the sky and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ironclad/29-6821/\">Ironclad</a>'s mass density get so heavy that he sinks into the ground working his way towards the earth's core.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The U-Foes were created by <a href=\"../../bill-mantlo/26-42478/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bill Mantlo</a> and <a href=\"../../sal-buscema/26-12717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sal Buscema</a> in 1980 and first appeared in <a href=\"../../the-incredible-hulk/49-2406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Incredible Hulk</a> # 254.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Of course this was not the end of the U-Foes. The team has tried to get revenge on the Hulk a multitude of times after their initial incarnation. They pop up every now and again with a second string treatment level but with first rate potential.</p><p>Much like the Fantastic Four, the team uses a family structure sharing the same goals and working together to reach their targets. Simon shares a romantic relationship with Ann much in the same way that Reed and Sue have but without the wedlock and the super powered offspring. Ann and Jimmy both come to each others aid in time of need like you would expect a loving siblings to do but this concern for one another is not specific to the siblings as all four members have dropped the cause of battle to aid one of their own in one instance or another.</p><p>Unlike the Marvel's first family, there is and air of negativity and dis-functionality that aids in their undoing, time and time again.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><p>The U-Foes fought the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\">West Coast Avengers</a> during the <a href=\"/acts-of-vengeance/39-41931/\">Acts of Vengeance</a>.</p><ul><li><h3>Civil War</h3></li></ul><p>The U-Foes registered as part of the Superhuman Registration Act after they were apprehended by the <a href=\"/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a>.

Prof. Utrecht is a ruthless business man as well as being a Professor. Utrecht convinces three other people to join him in his quest to recreate Dr. Banners experiment. In the game Banner says he was tempted to go and speak to him when he first began working on the project. The army realizes what Utrecht is doing and sends a group of soldiers to arrest go an arrest him. Playing as the Hulk you must reach them and destroy them before they get to Utrecht because Banner needs to talk to him. A man named Rick Jones is an alley with you and radios you and tells you that there is a gamma radiation level coming from the top of Utrecht's apartment and if you don't destroy the dish then it could be a very bad thing for the city. Still playing as the Hulk you must rush to the apartment and destroy the satellite dish that is drawing the gamma energy. After doing so a small cut scene of the Hulk destroying the rest of the building shows and then the ufoes stand up and are amazed with the Hulk but decide he is a threat to them and he must be stopped. They will come at you by twos and try to kill you. They have all renamed themselves, Utrecht has named himself Vector. The others are named Vapor,Ironclad, and X-Ray. After finally defeating them a video will play of Vector promising that if the Hulk ever interferes again he must be killed. You will meet them randomly throughout the city later on.</p><p>In the 2012 turn based RPG social network game, Avengers Ultimate Alliance, the U-Foes are reoccurring enemies in chapter 4: You, Foe. Part 1 of chapter 4 has Ironclad and Vapor as bosses, Part 2 has X-Ray, part 3 has Vector, and Vapor is the last U-Foe to appear in the chapter in part 4, as a main boss, as the closing boss fight for chapter 4 part 5 features Doctor Doom as the boss rather the a member of the U-Foes.</p><h3>Television</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1537835\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1537835-animated_u_men_super.jpg\" title=\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\"><img id=\"1537835\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1537835-animated_u_men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</div></div></div></div><p>The U-Foes made their animated debut on <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/17-31304/\">The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a>.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Rising out of the fall of the Axis Powers in World War II, HYDRA was created as a secret organization of global domination by Nazi spymaster <a href=\"/baron-von-strucker/29-4662/\">Baron Wolfgang von Strucker</a> along with <a href=\"/kraken/29-60717/\">Kraken</a>. This developed with the help of an alliance with <a href=\"/shoji-soma/29-76602/\">Shoji Soma</a>, grandmaster of the <a href=\"/the-hand/65-1800/\">Hand</a>. When the power base pf HYDRA felt firmly established, Strucker installed himself as its supreme commander and ended the alliance with the Hand.</p><p>HYDRA recruited from the remnants of the Nazi's military forces and acquired alien technologies to advance its resources beyond what most governments possessed. Strucker chose to build HYDRA\"s forces quietly over the following decades.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Hydra was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>Through the decades, HYDRA was consistently used as a source of all-purpose terrorism and villainous cannon fodder with its legions of uniformed operatives and its philosophy \"cut off one head and two will takes its place.\" It also consistently served as an opposite number for <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, Marvel's source of all-purpose espionage and heroic cannon fodder.</p><p>A number of other criminal organizations began as branches of HYDRA before striking off as their own independent entities, such as <a href=\"/aim/65-13497/\">A.I.M.</a> and the <a href=\"/secret-empire/65-15136/\">Secret Empire</a>.</p><p>Baron Strucker has most commonly depicted as HYDRA's supreme leader. However, the organization fractured after his first death, leading to a variety of HYDRAs with a variety of leaders. This continued even after Strucker was resurrected and he supposedly reunited HYDRA. Other apparently supreme leaders of HYDRA included <a href=\"/viper/29-3420/\">Viper</a> and <a href=\"/gorgon/29-3777/\">the Gorgon</a>.</p><p>This was addressed in <a href=\"/secret-warriors/49-25640/\"><i>Secret Warriors</i></a> by <a href=\"/jonathan-hickman/26-45065/\">Jonathan Hickman</a>, who introduced the <a href=\"/hydra-high-council/65-58039/\">HYDRA High Council</a>. This embraced the sometimes inconsistent portrayals of HYDRA by rationalizing it as HYDRA now having a council-based leadership that including Strucker, Viper, Gorgon, <a href=\"/the-hive/29-60718/\">the Hive</a>, Kraken and a new <a href=\"/contessa-valentina-allegro-de-la-fontaine/29-23797/\">Madame Hydra</a>. The structure of HYDRA was much more strongly defined through the course of this series but also heavily changed in the end due to an internal civil war. Much of the High Council was left either dead or defected, leaving HYDRA under the command of Gorgon and Madame HYDRA.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Enemy of the State</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/enemy-of-the-state/39-55965/\">Enemy of the State</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"265233\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine vs. Gorgon\"><img id=\"265233\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/265233-167540-wolverine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine vs. Gorgon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine vs. Gorgon</div></div></div></div><p>In an alliance between HYDRA and the Hand, Baron Von Strucker orchestrated a plan that saw <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> taken and killed by the Gorgon. Wolverine was then resurrected by the Hand's magic as a loyal agent of HYDRA. Wolverine was then sent on a killing spree in the superhuman and law enforcement communities in the service of HYDRA. Some of these superhumans were made into HYDRA agents using the same Hand magic that was used on Wolverine. Along the way, he also acquired defense secrets and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a>' technology for HYDRA. He was eventually brought down by a combined effort from the superhero community and freed of HYDRA's brainwashing. Despite this, HYDRA still accomplished a great deal.</p><p>All was not well within HYDRA, though. The Gorgon had entered into an affair with <a href=\"/elisbeth-von-strucker/29-4661/\">Elsbeth Strucker</a>, Baron Strucker's wife, and used this to overthrow h im as the Supreme Hydra. Both HYDRA and the Hand were now under his command, and he focused on the part of Strucker's plan involving using the Hand's magic to convert superhumans. He ordered a killing spree of superheroes and supervillains alike so that their bodies could be revived as loyal HYDRA agents, quickly gathering together a small army of them. .</p><p>However, S.H.I.E.L.D. had successfully deprogrammed Wolverine, and the mutant now wanted nothing but revenge. He tore through the Hand and Gorgon's former death cult, the Dawn of the White Light. He then came after Gorgon as he was carrying out a plan to assassinate Nick Fury. It was only Wolverine's last second intervention that prevented Gorgon from killing Fury, and Wolverine just barely managed to kill Gorgon, cutting off another head of HYDRA.</p><h3>The Seven Capital Cities of Heaven</h3><p>A man known simply as <a href=\"/xao/29-52979/\">Xao</a> formed an alliance with HYDRA in a plot to break through the mystical barrier separating Earth from <a href=\"/kun-lun/34-56104/\">K'un-Lun</a> and pillage the city of its ancient wonders. This plan failed when <a href=\"/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> managed to unite the <a href=\"/immortal-weapons/65-51583/\">Immortal Weapons</a> of all the other cities of Heaven against HYDRA's invasion force. The never made it through to K'un-Lun, and Xao was killed.</p><h3>Nick Fury: Agent of Nothing</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/nick-fury-agent-of-nothing/39-56029/\">Nick Fury: Agent of Nothing</a>, <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"818689\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34475/818689-copy__2__of_secret_warriors_4_8_super.jpg\" title=\"HYDRA High Council\"><img id=\"818689\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34475/818689-copy__2__of_secret_warriors_4_8_medium.jpg\" alt=\"HYDRA High Council\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">HYDRA High Council</div></div></div></div><p>When Nick Fury went rogue from S.H.I.E.L.D. and the government, it was discovered that for many years HYDRA had one of its tentacles into the highest levels of S.H.I.E.L.D., effectively meaning Fury had been working for HYDRA all this time. Ironically, HYDRA was dealing with its own infiltrators around the same time, namely the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a>. Upon realization that he had been breached by the Skrulls, Strucker chose to completely destroyed his undersea base codenamed Ichor with all of its personnel. He then reconvened HYDRA at Gehenna, their most treasured stronghold, and called the full HYDRA High Council together. They even forced the Grandmaster of the Hand to resurrect the Gorgon to convene the full council of HYDRA's leaders.</p><p>So it was that Baron Strucker, Kraken, the Hive, the Gorgon, Madame Hydra and the Viper all met together for what was apparently the first time, and Strucker laid out his intentions. Fury had discovered their true structure and was going to come for them. Rather than wait, he wanted HYDRA to go to war with Fury. Though some were reluctant, there was unanimous consent for Strucker's war.</p><h3>Wake the Beast</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/wake-the-beast/39-56433/\">Wake the Beast</a></p><p>HYDRA was betrayed by one of its leaders Madame Hydra, otherwise known as Contessa Allegro de la Fontaine. She was, in fact, a sleeper agent of <a href=\"/leviathan/65-57417/\">Leviathan</a>, an ancient enemy of HYDRA's dating back to the years of its very formation. She acquired from them an alien power source that could be used to awaken Leviathan's leader from stasis, and so rose <a href=\"/orion/29-70203/\">Orion</a>, leader of Leviathan. The two organizations met for what HYDRA hoped could be an understanding between them. Leviathan was not interested in any understanding, and so fierce war began between Leviathan and HYDRA.</p><p>All the while, Nick Fury and his small force of <a href=\"/secret-warriors/65-54569/\">Secret Warriors</a> manipulated events to urge them on.</p><h3>Wheels Within Wheels</h3><p>HYDRA took heavy losses in the war with Leviathan, and this was made worse when Nick Fury and his Secret Warriors successfully destroyed Gehenna. The loss of this stronghold fractured HYDRA's leadership, and two factions clashed in an internal civil war. One side rallied behind the Gorgon and the other behind Kraken. This only increased HYDRA's losses, and it turned out this was all carefully orchestrated by Nick Fury. Kraken was not the original man who helped create HYDRA but was actually Jake Fury. HYDRA had been played into killing itself, and Nick Fury personally executed Strucker.</p><p>Though diminished, HYDRA managed to endure because Fury had not accounted in his plans for Gorgon's resurrection. What remained of HYDRA gathered un his and Viper's leadership.</p><h2>Ultimate</h2><p>Spider-Man saved Tony Stark from an attack by HYDRA. Jameson recalls this events after Spidey's death.</p><h2>Exiles</h2><p>They are well underway with their plan to take over the world. This version is being led by Madame Hydra (Sue Storm) and her lover, Wolverine. Various other superhumans, including Captain America (now Captain Hydra), Iron Man and Slaymaster, are agents of HYDRA in this world. One of the Exiles' foe, the original character Venger later becomes an agent of HYDRA, as well as Boy-Bob Banner.</p><h2>MAX</h2><p>A terrorist organization that was involved in Cold War and battled against S.H.I.E.L.D. <a href=\"../../colonel-gagarin/29-14212/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colonel Gagarin</a> was a member.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h3><p>They seem more like a Men-In-Black team.</p><h3>Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/the-avengers-earths-mightiest-heroes/17-31304/\">Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1440698\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39997/1440698-hydrasoldiers_super.jpg\" title=\"Animated HYDRA\"><img id=\"1440698\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39997/1440698-hydrasoldiers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Animated HYDRA\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Animated HYDRA</div></div></div></div><p>In the continuity of this Disney XD animated series, HYDRA serves as a stand-in for the Nazi's in World War II and features prominently in Captain America's adventures in that era with Baron Heinrich Zemo and the Red Skull as its high-ranking commanders. HYDRA persists as a recurring threat through the first season in modern day as well under the command of Baron Von Strucker, though Viper is also present as Madame Hydra. <a href=\"/grim-reaper/29-7227/\">Grim Reaper</a> plays the role of one of HYDRA's foremost superhuman operatives, and <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> seemingly betrays S.H.I.E.L.D. to join them, secretly doing so as a double agent for Nick Fury.</p><p>HYDRA is ultimately defeated later in the first season when it goes with war with A.I.M. over possession of the Cosmic Cube. The Avengers intervene, leading to a battle between Captain America and Baron Strucker for the cube. They both touch it, seemingly having no affect. Both HYDRA and A.I.M. are then defeated and incarcerated.</p><p>HYDRA is the major villain in the rare video game titled <b>Spider-man: Web of Fire</b></p><p>In <b>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</b>, one of the levels includes an old HYDRA base that the Anti-Registration group was using. HYDRA's aerial base can be seen attacking the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier in the latter's stage in <b>Marvel Capcom 3</b> and the organization's logo can also be seen on the car that attempts to run She-Hulk down in one of her special moves.</p><h3>Ultimate Avengers 2</h3><p>Some HYDRA agents appear at the beginning fighting against Cap. After Cap defeats most of the agents, two of them try to escape in a van. Cap throws his shield, which slices clean through the van back-to-front, and causing it to skid out of control. The van crashes into a tank of some sort of chemicals, which then burst open, showering the van. The van melts along with both HYDRA agents.</p><h3>X-men: The Official Game</h3><p>HYDRA is partially responsible for the creation of the Master Mold and Sentinels alongside William Stryker. Under orders of their leader, Silver Samurai, HYDRA infiltrates Stryker's base to remove all evidence and Sentinel equipment, and by accident, activated the Master Mold. Lady Deathstrike was an agent of HYDRA too.</p><h3>Captain America: the First Avenger (2011)</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"/captain-america-the-first-avenger/223-927/\">Captain America: the First Avenger</a></p><p>HYDRA is featured in this World War II era movie as a scientific research and development branch of the Third Reich. It is operated by the Red Skull and goes rogue from the German forces with its own advanced technology and weaponry. The organization is defeated after Captain America apparently kills Red Skull in battle, leading to their defeat by American forces. They appear in the movie's video game too.</p><h3>X-Men: Evolution</h3><p><b>For further information:</b> <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/x-men-evolution/17-5435/\">X-Men: Evolution</a></p><p>In this X-Men animated series for Kids' WB, HYDRA appears briefly with seemingly Viper in command and as part of Wolverine's history.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>SHIELD was formed by (of course) <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury,</a> in the period after <a href=\"/world-war-ii/12-56025/\">World War II</a>. However, he figured the U.S government wouldn't want a group like that, so he disbanded it. Later, though, after a terrorist attack, he noticed that a group like SHIELD could really have helped and prevented the disaster. So he reformed it. Meanwhile, the <a href=\"/united-nations/65-57235/\">United Nations</a> had already taken SHIELD and restarted it, made it big. Fury immediately joined and rose to the top. The Nations had reformed it in response to a HYDRA attack, and once Fury was leading it, it flourished.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Shield made their first appearance in <a href=\"/strange-tales/49-18066/\">Strange Tales</a> #135. They were created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby.</a></p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><p>SHIELD (Strategic Hazard Intervention, Espionage and Logistics Directorate) or Supreme Headquarters International Espionage Law enforcement Division (see Iron Man #227) is a group affiliated with the U.N that deals with superhuman threats. It is an intelligence and anti-terrorism group similar to the FBI, only it is an international corporation that spans all the world. It acts like the police force. SHIELD agents are armed and work well, much more effective then standard police. They fight terrorists as well as super humans. SHIELD also has been responsible for the starting of spin-off groups like SWORD and S.T.R.I.K.E. S.H.I.E.L.D has agents that also are higher level, that often are super humans. Captain America, Spider-Woman, and Iron Man all have operated as SHIELD agents. SHIELD keeps ties to the superhuman community, too-they often call on the Fantastic Four, the Avengers, and Captain America.</p><p>SHIELD has superhuman agents in the past-two teams were formed in an effort to make a SHIELD superhuman team. The first team consisted of Marvel Man, Texas Twister, the Vamp, and Blue Streak. However, it quickly failed, and another team in the same vein also failed. The Psi-Division of SHIELD is a group of psychics or telepathics that deal with psionic menaces. This is only one of the groups of super humans that work in SHIELD for the greater good.</p><p>All SHIELD members have a certain level, based on their importance. A normal SHIELD agent will have a Level One-which means he can pass through Level One areas and has clearance. A sergeant might have Level Two, which means he has Level Two and One clearance. The Director of SHIELD has a Level Nine clearance. Level Ten means the most important person in the world-no one currently possesses a Level Ten clearance. Not even the President, or Nick Fury.</p><p>SHIELD has many bases around the world. Many are on land-most notably SHIELD Central, which is located in New York City. There are also many shelters that are secretly placed around the world. Fury has used one, as has the Secret Avengers when they needed a base during the events of Civil War. However, their most famous and important base is the SHIELD Helicarrier.</p><h3>Helicarrier</h3><p>The Helicarrier is an aircraft that is constantly in the air. It is huge enough to hold an aircraft carrier. It is the mobile headquarters of SHIELD-and is extremely protected. The Helicarrier has held an entire squadron of jet fighters and a nuclear ballistic missile. There is one major Helicarrier, which is the one that is most important and used. There are also many smaller Helicarriers, however, which all serve as bases too. The Helicarrier has an extremely high level of security-even if someone managed to get on without clearance, guards and extremely powerful security technology would have them gone in a second. The Helicarrier was first proposed by Stark Industries, and was designed by Tony Stark, Forge, and Mr. Fantastic.</p><p>SHIELD operated as a covert, military/intelligence agency at the time, and members of it had already appeared. SHIELD already fought HYDRA then-the evil group had plots like the aforementioned \"Overkill Horn\". AIM made it's first appearance, and individual villains such as Red Skull also popped up and needed to be stopped by SHIELD. At this time, Godzilla came, and the Godzilla Squad was formed to take the monster down. SHIELD had tough periods during this time. Several lifelike robots got so smart that they became able to think and make choices-they became sentient beings. They had a grudge against SHIELD for making them follow orders all the time before they had intelligence-so they drugged important SHIELD members and took their place within the organization. Several of these were Contessa Valentina Allegro De Fontaine , Jimmy Woo , and Jasper Sitwell , among others. However, the valiant Fury managed to take them down.</p><h3>Fury's Influence</h3><p>Most of the reason that SHIELD was so effective started with Fury. He started the group and put good, effective agents in place. He was extremely popular in and out of SHIELD, and had strong ties with the hero community. Without him, many \"pessimists\" and intellectuals theorized that SHIELD would fall, and fall hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were right.</p><p>SHIELD ran into disastrous times. As aforementioned, Nick Fury did a mission in Latveria to stop them from attacking the U.S. However, it was totally unauthorized, and Fury was forced to resign from SHIELD Warrants went out for his arrest. The new head of SHIELD was Maria Hill-who proved to be incompetent at the position. The President of the U.S was a driving force behind Hill's election-for two reasons. Hill was a North American, and the President expected her to be loyal first and foremost to the U.S. Even though SHIELD was a United Nations facility. Also, many men and women had been members of SHIELD for a long time, and they would have been much better as the head of SHIELD. However, they were \"too loyal to Fury\", so Hill got the job to keep the Fury loyalists out.</p><p>SHIELD took a downward turn. Fury's work as the head of SHIELD was extremely effective, and an insane amount of work had kept corruption out of the huge organization. Unfortunately, Hill wasn't as good as Fury at it, and SHIELD became corrupt and weak. Crimes were committed. Criminals were \"stockpiled\" in prison. Worst of all, the Avengers discovered that someone was mining the anti-metal in the Savage Land using slave labor-and SHIELD was the prime suspect.</p><h3>Subdivisions</h3><p>SHIELD also has many subdivisions and other groups based off it. Two other groups have been formed from S.H.I.E.L.D- <a href=\"../../sword/65-41666/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.W.O.R.D</a>, and S.A.F.E.</p><p>SWORD stands for Sentient World Observation and Response Department. As you can easily guess, S.W.O.R.D works with extraterrestrials. It stops extraterrestrial threats, keeps tabs on powerful aliens, etc. They are not a subdivision of SHIELD, but are actually a separate, yet similar group that simply works with SHIELD. However, they are closely affiliated with both SHIELD and the United Nations. SWORD encountered Ord, an alien who was convinced that a mutant from Earth was destined to destroy his planet. He attempted to attack Earth to kill all the mutants-but SWORD and the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> stopped him, effectively stopping an interplanetary war. The leader of SWORD is <a href=\"../../abigail-brand/29-4441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abigail Brand</a>, a tough, effective leader who stopped many crises and is extremely valuable to SHIELD. She was a Fury loyalist and respected him a lot-but greatly dislikes Maria Hill. As for Tony Stark, he has not encountered SWORD or Brand yet. SWORD is currently trying to stop another war with a planet called Breakworld.</p><p>SHIELD is loyal to the United Nations-so two countries have created their own answer to SHIELD that works within their country and their country alone. The first to appear was the British version of SHIELD, S.T.R.I.K.E-which stood for Special Tactical Reserve for International Key Emergencies. S.T.R.I.K.E was British, but one of their early leaders, Tod Radcliffe, was revealed to be a traitor that worked for the Red Skull. The next leader was Lance Hunter. They worked closely with <a href=\"../../captain-britain/29-7477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Britain</a>. However, Vixen (Cap Britain's enemy) took them over and S.T.R.I.K.E was disbanded. The most prominent person to work for S.T.R.I.K.E was Betsy Braddock, who had psychic powers. After leaving S.T.R.I.K.E. she joined the X-Men as the heroine <a href=\"../../psylocke/29-3176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psylocke</a>.</p><p>S.A.F.E is the United States answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. The name stands for Strategic Action For Emergencies. S.A.F.E is nearly identical to S.H.I.E.L.D-except they are only in the U.S. They have fought many enemies, including Doctor Doom and <a href=\"../../baron-heinrich-zemo/29-3708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a>. The leader is Sean Morgan, a competent leader and good soldier. Joshua Ballard is the most prolific agent, and he's extremely helpful-he's the Dum Dum Dugan of S.A.F.E.</p><p>Along with these agencies, other small groups have been formed including Euromind and Starcore.</p><p>Another group that has continually showed up over the years is the Cape Killers. They were never an official SHIELD group, but SHIELD agents did make up it's ranks. The term Cape Killers was given to any group of soldiers trained to hunt, subdue and in worst case scenario kill meta humans. The Cape Killers have had such members as Agent Abrams, Agent Cleery, Dum Dum Dugan, &amp; Special Agent Marquez, and her partner Agent McAllister.</p><h3>Members</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"916245\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4_super.jpg\" title=\"Nick Fury\"><img id=\"916245\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11746/916245-prv3173_pg4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Fury\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nick Fury</div></div></div></div><p>The most prominent, important, and effective member of SHIELD is the man who runs it all-Nick Fury. Fury was born in New York City in 1921, to decorated World War I pilot Jack Fury. He and his friend Red Hargrove lusted after adventure-so they joined the U.S Army in World War II. Nick was an adept soldier, and he was given command of the First Attack Squad-nicknamed the <a>Howling Commandos</a>. The Howling Commandos were extremely effective-and Fury quickly became a decorated war hero.</p><p>After the war, Fury was hit by a land mine and badly injured. The government decided to test a new formula on him-that would heal him and greatly retard his aging. This was called the <a>Infinity Formula</a>. It worked-Fury was restored to full strength and is still in his physical prime today. He eventually joined the CIA and became a CIA agent in Korea, also interacting with the Fantastic Four. Tony Stark hired him to be the second commander of SHIELD, and Fury excelled at the job. Under his leadership, SHIELD grew and grew until it is now one of the most powerful organizations in the world. Fury led SHIELD for over forty years, working tirelessly and keeping it powerful and secret.</p><p>However, Fury recently discovered that <a>Latveria</a>, led by the evil <a>Doctor Doom</a>, was planning to attack America. He immediately had SHIELD launch a covert assault on the country, effectively stopping the massive attack that would have taken place. A year later, Latveria attacked back, and thousands were killed. Fury was blamed-and <a>Luke Cage</a> was injured. Captain America was angered at Fury. Eventually, this culminated in Fury being fired as commander of SHIELD. A warrant was put out for his arrest, and <a>Maria Hill</a> took his place as the head of SHIELD. Hill still leads SHIELD, and Fury is still in hiding. He keeps control over parts of SHIELD and lent a base to the Secret Avengers during Civil War.</p><p>Nick Fury is infused with the Infinity Formula, meaning he barely ages at all. He is an soldier, with lots of experience as both a warrior and a leader. He is a master tactician and strategist, and is very good with all sorts of weapons. He wields great political power as the head of SHIELD, and is a very good hand-to-hand combatant.</p><p>Nick Fury is not the only SHIELD agent-not by a long shot. Many of the other important SHIELD members date back from Fury's old team-the Howling Commandos.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"141426\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan_super.jpg\" title=\"Dum Dum Dugan\"><img id=\"141426\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4312/141426-170316-dum-dum-dugan_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Dum Dum Dugan\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dum Dum Dugan</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> (Timothy Aloysius Cadwallader Dugan) was working as a circus strongman before he enlisted in World War II. He was put in the Howling Commandos, a new division led by Nick Fury. He was extremely valuable to the team-he was so strong that he was able to save them from many things that should have killed them. He was a great marksman, strongman, and leader, and he became Fury's second-in-command. When the war ended, Fury invited Dugan into SHIELD as his second-in-command. Dugan has easily been the second-most-important person to SHIELD. His missions have included tracking down and killing a radioactive monster ( <a>Godzilla</a>, in the Godzilla Squad) and various independent missions to take super villains (often with <a>Squirrel Girl</a>). For a long time, he worked maintaining security on the Helicarrier, and working for Fury whenever needed. When Fury was replaced by Maria Hill, he was her second-in-command and was put in charge of mutant affairs. This involved conflicts with <a>Wolverine</a>, who he had a mysterious contact with. Eventually, he tried to resign from SHIELD when Tony Stark took control. He was rejected-he was too important to SHIELD to quit. He was recently shot in the chest by Wolverine's son, but he survived, and is currently in the hospital.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"804114\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/804114-001_super.jpg\" title=\"Gabriel Jones\"><img id=\"804114\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/804114-001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gabriel Jones\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gabriel Jones</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../gabriel-jones/29-13836/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gabriel Jones</a> was a young African-American living in <a>New York City</a> when a little thing called World War II popped up.

After the war was over, Jones served on the Godzilla Squad with other former Howling Commandos (not Fury), and later joined SHIELD. He ran out missions with or without other agents for SHIELD until he retired, due to the events in the miniseries \"Nick Fury vs. SHIELD\". He remains retired today, living the quiet, peaceful life. He sure deserves that. He also has the honor of being the first African-American in the Howling Commandos.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"765560\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/765560-scpage_super.jpg\" title=\"Sharon Carter aka Agent 13\"><img id=\"765560\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/765560-scpage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Carter aka Agent 13\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sharon Carter aka Agent 13</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../sharon-carter/29-38227/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agent 13</a> (also known as <a>Sharon Carter</a>), is one of the most important members of SHIELD. As a young girl, Sharon loved hearing stories of her older sister Peggy, who was a World War 1 flying ace and freedom fighter. Peggy had worked with Captain America, and the two fell in love. However, Cap never learned her name, and he then froze in suspended animation. Sharon was a good fighter and loved justice, so she joined SHIELD under the codename \"Agent 13\" and ran out several missions for them. She kept crossing paths with Cap, who had been resurrected and they eventually fell in love. Cap wanted her to quit as a SHIELD agent, but she refused. Eventually, her death was faked so she could be sent off on a top-secret mission. The mission failed, and she was presumed dead. Cap was never informed that her death was faked the first time. However, he eventually found her, and she rejoined SHIELD. She now works as a high-level agent, reporting directly to Hill for missions. Recently, she was given a hypnotic suggestion by <a>Dr. Faustus</a> to help kill Steve Rogers, and under hypnotism, shot him in the stomach after <a>Crossbones</a>, a sniper and <a>Red Skull</a>'s henchman, shot him. It was also revealed that she is pregnant with Cap's baby.</p><p>Other important SHIELD agents include <a>Contessa Valentina Allegro De Fontaine</a>, <a>Clay Quartermain</a>, <a>Jimmy Woo</a>, and <a>Jasper Sitwell</a>.</p><h3>Hydra</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1487794\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71666/1487794-sw_21_0007_super.jpg\" title=\"Hydra\"><img id=\"1487794\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71666/1487794-sw_21_0007_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hydra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hydra</div></div></div></div><p>Since SHIELD is a major force and such a huge, powerful organization, it bound to have many enemies. Most of SHIELD's enemies are big groups-and the most powerful, fearsome, and deadly one of them all is <a href=\"../../hydra/65-3480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydra</a>. HYDRA is SHIELD's archenemy. The motto of the group is \"Cut off one of our heads, and two more will take it's place!\" This is a reference to the Ancient Greek monster called the hydra, which fought <a href=\"../../hercules/29-2503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hercules</a> and had the same ability. HYDRA is a terrorist group dedicated to taking over the world and destroying SHIELD, which has foiled them many a time.</p><p>HYDRA has actually been around for centuries. The group goes all the way back to Imperial Japan, which only sought to rule Japan. This all changed in the 1900s when Wolfgang Von Strucker joined the group. Strucker was insane, deluded, and powerful-and he quickly rose to the top of the group. he steered it away from Japan and decided on a new goal-rule the world!When he got to the top, he changed his name and got a title-he became <a href=\"../../baron-strucker/29-4662/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Strucker</a>. HYDRA was originally very open, not quiet, and SHIELD was actually specifically formed to fight it (as you will read later). HYDRA and SHIELD became enemies-constantly warring to take each other down. HYDRA made several daring moves. Strucker invented the \"Overkill Horn\", which would detonate all nuclear explosives worldwide. Later came the biological \"Death-Spore Bomb\". Both plots were foiled by SHIELD, and the latter resulted in Strucker's death.</p><p>After Baron Strucker died, HYDRA split into many mini-groups, or \"heads\" of HYDRA. Some of these were East Coast HYDRA, Las Vegas HYDRA, New York HYDRA, and Germany HYDRA. These factions also genetically created super agents for HYDRA, resulting in the creation of many villains. However, this backfired when the great hero Spider-Woman was created by HYDRA related. Eventually Strucker was revived, and he reunited HYDRA. They continued their war against SHIELD and the Earth.</p><p>HYDRA later planned a massive attack on the U.S-they smuggled nuclear missile into America and was going to launch a bio nuclear assault on a major aquifer. They also tried to brainwash an army of heroes and villains (including <a href=\"../../elektra/29-1802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elektra</a> and <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a>). Both times, they were foiled by SHIELD and the <a href=\"../../new-avengers/65-42520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Avengers</a> (including Spider-Woman, who they created). HYDRA is still extremely dangerous, and cannot be stopped easily. The only reason they don't currently rule the world is because of the heroic efforts of SHIELD.</p><p>The HYDRA Agent is similar to the SHIELD agent. He is extremely well-trained-only the elite become agents. They carry a large variety of weapons and are trained especially in stealth. HYDRA Agents often get missions to detonate, destroy, beat up, or burn things, and they are superb fighters. Some Agents of HYDRA have been Red Skull, <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a>, and many others.</p><h3>AIM</h3><p>Although HYDRA is easily SHIELD's greatest enemy, it is by no means the only one. One of SHIELD's worst enemies is <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.I.M</a>.</p><p>A.I.M (Advanced Idea Mechanics) was created as a subdivision of HYDRA, by Baron Strucker. AIM's purpose was to create new technological wonders for HYDRA to use against SHIELD and to take over the world. It is a group of scientists, industrialists, and technological geniuses, and originally, they provided and designed weapons, defenses, and huge assault mechanisms for HYDRA. However, HYDRA suffered a huge defeat from the U.S and Japan Armies, so AIM broke off into it's own group. Like HYDRA, AIM's goal is to rule the Earth. However, unlike HYDRA, who wants to do it by force, AIM seeks domination by technological means. They have created huge weapons and marvels before, and share one trait with HYDRA-they are dedicated to destroying SHIELD. AIM was led by the Scientist Supreme, an evil, shadowy figure where very little about him is known by S.H.I.E.L.D.</p><p>The <a href=\"../../cosmic-cube/18-40949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Cube</a> was an intensely powerful item-it could literally alter reality to the user's whim. Red Skull once stole it and wreaked havoc with it, but that was later. The Cube was created by the scientists at AIM, who sought to use it to rule the world. However, the Cube actually evolved into a new creature, <a href=\"../../kubik/29-20022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kubik</a>, and AIM no longer controls it. In this vein, AIM created the <a href=\"../../super-adaptoid/29-10861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Adaptoid</a>, which could exactly mimic the powers and appearance of other superheroes and villains. Although it was immensely powerful, the Adaptoid contained a sliver of the Cosmic Cube that gave it its power. When the Cube became Kubik, it wanted the shard back, so it easily destroyed the creature and regained the sliver. AIM also created <a href=\"../../modok/29-3709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MODOK</a> (Mobile Organism Designed Only for Killing). MODOK was originally one of AIM's own scientists, and he took control of AIM and improved it, continuing the fight to rule the world and destroy SHIELD. MODOK still is in charge of AIM.</p><p>Along with A.I.M, some of SHIELD's enemies are <a href=\"../../zodiac/65-41170/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zodiac</a> and Godzilla.</p><p>Zodiac is a criminal organization that was created using SHIELD technology. Each member is another sign of the Zodiac, and they are dedicated to world domination. Although the Zodiac mostly fights the Avengers, they often collide with SHIELD in their efforts to have the world ruled by their criminal organization.</p><p>Godzilla was a radioactive monster that rose out of the waters of Tokyo, Japan. SHIELD immediately responded to the crisis, and formed the Godzilla Squad out of some of its members. The Squad was led by Dum Dum Dugan (who never fully recovered from the experience), and its mission was to take down Godzilla! Godzilla caused lots of property damage around Asia and North America before it was finally driven back into the sea. Obviously, this is based on the Japanese movie in real life of the same name-minus the SHIELD agents.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Civil War</h3><p>The Civil War started when the <a>New Warriors</a> (consisting of <a>Robbie Baldwin</a>, <a>Namorita</a>, <a>Microbe</a>, and <a>Night Thrasher</a>) went on a basic mission to catch four criminals in an old house. They included <a>Speedfreek</a> and an old <a>Captain Marvel</a> villain- <a>Nitro</a>. These villains had escaped from the Raft when <a>Electro</a> broke them out. The New Warriors easily defeated the villains-but Nitro was escaping. Namorita stopped him, but he let off an explosion, destroying Stamford and murdering 600 people.</p><p>Tony Stark, also known as Iron Man, proposed the Superhuman Registration Act, where all super humans would have to register their powers and identities. They'd basically be cops. Maria Hill, who was the head of SHIELD, supported the Act, and eventually it was passed. Many super humans disagreed with the Act, the most important and prolific being Captain America. SHIELD was enlisted by the U.S government-take down Cap and his anti-registration hero team, the <a>Secret Avengers</a>. New SHIELD Agents, nicknamed cape-killers, went after anti-reg heroes. SHIELD was led by Maria Hill, and was fully pro-reg. Iron Man worked closely with SHIELD also-he revealed his identity as Tony Stark. Many battles were fought. Eventually, Tony Stark's pro-registration side-and SHIELD-won. However, Maria Hill found out why she had been made the head of SHIELD, as aforementioned-to keep more effective \"Fury loyalists\" out and be loyal to the U.S. She was not supposed to be effective, and she wasn't. Dismayed, she turned leadership of SHIELD over to the man she thought deserved it most-Tony Stark. Stark, also Iron Man, is currently the leader and head of SHIELD</p><h3>HAMMER</h3><p>In the fallout of Secret Invasion Norman Osborn is granted the keys to the whole world and closes down SHIELD and replaces it with his own special forces known as HAMMER.</p><p>Nick fury also discovers a dark secret about who as been pulling SHIELD's strings the whole time he was an agent in Secret Warriors #1.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>SHIELD has a lot of technology, important technology that is often used. Perhaps the most important is the LMD- <a href=\"../../life-model-decoy/18-42286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Life Model Decoy</a>. The Life Model Decoy is an android that is absolutely indistinguishable from whoever it impersonates. Fingerprints, DNA, hair, speech, thought patterns (for telepaths), anything, the Decoy is exactly the same. However, it is an android. LMDs are used to duplicate people and take their place if they are going to be assassinated or there is a strong chance of an attack. LMDs have been used in place of personnel since the beginning of the organization, including Jessica Drew. Most often, they have been used as a substitute for Nick Fury, who has had at least five LMDs destroyed in attempts to have him killed. These robots are a lot of the reason that many key SHIELD members are still alive. The Zodiac, a criminal organization, was created using stolen SHIELD LMDs. Also, LMDs have gained sentience a few times. The Deltites were a group of LMDs that gained sentience and tried to infiltrate SHIELD. They were narrowly defeated by Nick Fury.</p><p>SHIELD also has used robot exoskeletons and gargantuan robots to achieve its ends. <a href=\"../../red-ronin/29-33761/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Ronin</a> is the most important of those. Red Ronin was a huge, super powerful robot that was used by the Godzilla Squad. The robot was destroyed by Godzilla before he was driven into the sea. It was rebuilt, but was hijacked by a mad scientist who was trying to start World War Three. It was stopped by the Avengers and SHIELD regained the remains. It has been stolen and used for evil many times, by Dr. Doom, <a href=\"../../the-hand/65-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hand</a>, and <a href=\"../../henry-gyrich/29-9711/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry Gyrich</a>. Each time, the robot has been defeated and rebuilt (by heroes like <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wasp</a> and Hulk)-only to be stolen again. Red Ronin is currently possessed and used by the evil villain The Fixer-it appears that the cycle is still going.</p><p>Of course, the most prolific technology created and used by SHIELD is the Helicarrier. The Helicarrier is outfitted with weapons, security, and is constantly filled with SHIELD agents who are extremely effective and good fighters. The Helicarrier is always being attacked by villains, and they are barely ever successful. Read more about the Helicarrier at the top of the page. A smaller version of the Helicarrier, the Behemoth, is often used by SHIELD Agents on missions, including by the Squad and by Dum Dum Dugan. The Behemoth is similar to the Helicarrier, only there is less weapons, technology, and it isn't as fast or powerful.</p><p>As for other technology, SHIELD has access to an infinite amount of military-level tech. Tools, weapons, anything that's used, SHIELD can get. Anything from pistols to nuclear weapons is easily attainable. Fighter jets are often used by SHIELD agents when it is necessary for their mission.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</h3><p>In the Ultimate Marvel universe, S.H.I.E.L.D was started and first led by <a href=\"../../general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">General Thunderbolt Ross</a>, who is a major enemy of the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>. SHIELD funded and sanctioned projects like <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-5018/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a>, which created Wolverine. A now-black Nick Fury took control of the group and was very effective. He tried to recreate the Super Soldier program, making another Captain America. the project failed and the formula turned the lead scientist on the project, Bruce Banner, into the Hulk. SHIELD tried again with the Oz formula. It was responsible for the creation of <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"../../green-goblin/29-1484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Goblin</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sandman</a>, and Electro.</p><p>Also, Ultimate SHIELD created the <a href=\"../../ultimates/65-40504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimates</a>, as the government enlisted Fury to create a strike force of government-sponsored superheroes. The force was similar to the Avengers in the 616 universe, and answers to Ultimate SHIELD.</p><h3>Marvel Zombiverse (Earth-2149)</h3><p>SHIELD also appears in Marvel Zombies Universe. At first, some of the members are already infected by the virus when Sentry came to Earth infected. The first of the members infected were Colonel America, <a href=\"../../ms-marvel/29-21561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=\"../../hawkeye/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hawkeye</a>, and <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a>. Luke Cage is part of the Avengers. After these infections, it starts to go on from there, with the infected heroes infecting other heroes and villains while eating people completely. <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> becomes infected by Spider-Man after saving <a href=\"../../nova/29-2105/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nova</a> and Nova is saved by the Fantastic Four and Thor and goes to the SHIELD Helicarrier. SHIELD has called all uninfected heroes to meet together with Nick Fury and Nick Fury tells the uninfected heroes that they must make a defensive stand against the infected. The heroes agree to this, SHIELD, Avengers, and many more alike, and they go fight the zombies. However, this ends in tragedy and the uninfected become infected by the virus. The heroes were no match for the zombies and they all subdue to infection, becoming one of them. SHIELD becomes no more and all of the members are killed or infected.</p><h3>Mutant X (Earth-1298)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"661527\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super_super.jpg\" title=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\"><img id=\"661527\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/661527-107103_18073_108376_1_x_men_2099_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">S.H.I.E.L.D. 2099</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, SHIELD now stands for Save Humanity by Intervention in the Evolution of Life-form Deviants.
