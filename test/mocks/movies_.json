        "description":"<p>The film Daredevil starts off with Daredevil at a church, weakened and nearly unconscious. He is found by Father Everett, who unmasks him to see that it is Matthew Murdock, a blind lawyer. Matt's mind then goes back to how he got his powers.</p><p>An unknown time ago, young Matt was growing up with his father, a boxer named Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock. Jack frequently made Matt promise that he would study hard, and not end up a loser like him. A few days later, Matt is walking home from school along the docks, when he sees his father attacking someone. Out of fear, Matt runs away, but has radioactive waste sprayed into his eye when a forklift accidentally opens a barrel. Matt wakes up in hospital some time later, blind, but with his remaining senses superhumanly sharp. His father and him make a silent promise to each other to never give up.</p><p>Matt's father regrets this promise later, as he is supposed to purposely lose a fight, but doesn't for Matt's sake. As a result of this, Matt's father is murdered.</p><p>Going forwards about ten years later, Matt is a lawyer alongside his colleague Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson. In court, he uses his super hearing to tell that a man is guilty, but cannot prove it. As a result, the criminal goes free, but Matt decides to stop him. That night, he gets into his Daredevil costume and tracks down the man to a bar. After he defeats everyone else in the bar, he chases the man to a subway station, and pushes the man onto the tracks, where he is run over by a subway. The next day, the police find the body, and a reporter named Ben Urich tries to convince them it was Daredevil's work, but the police don't believe him.</p><p>That same day, Foggy and Matt are in a cafe, where Matt notices a young woman. He follows her out of the cafe, insisting that she should give him her name, but she refuses. The two have a fight in a playground, where neither are able to gain an advantage over the other, which is a first for both of them. Eventually the woman tells Matt that her name is Elektra Natchios. Elektra is the daughter of Nikolas Natchios, a billionaire, who is secretly working for the Kingpin of crime. Nikolas tells the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) that he is going to stop crime, but after he does so, Wilson makes plans to frame him as being the Kingpin.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the assassin Bullseye manages to kill Nikolas Natchios, and makes it look as if Daredevil is the murderer. Elektra swears revenge on Daredevil, which leads to her and Daredevil fighting. Elektra manages to badly wound and unmask Daredevil, and realises that he didn't kill her father. Just after Elektra unmasks Daredevil, she is attacked and killed by Bullseye. Daredevil escapes to a church, where the movie began, but is followed by Bullseye. The two fight until Daredevil manages to get a police sniper to shoot Bullseye's hands. Daredevil then throws Bullseye to the ground from the top of the church.</p><p>Daredevil then goes to Wilson Fisk, as Bullseye mentioned that he was the real Kingpin. Daredevil and Kingpin fight, and for a moment it seems as if Kingpin has won, but then Daredevil smashes a window, bringing rain in which makes it easier for Matt to fight in. With the advantage, Kingpin is soon defeated.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Batman Forever was the third entry in the Burton/Schumacher Batman Films. In it Batman and Robin have to stop Two-Face and The Riddler from destroying Gotham City. The film was Joel Schumacher's first Batman film. The film was also Val Kilmer's debut as Batman, he only played Batman in one film due to him already starting on another movie by the time Batman and Robin was going into pre-production.</p><h2>Plot</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"459608\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/459608-batmanforevertitle_super.jpg\" title=\"Title Screen\"><img id=\"459608\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/459608-batmanforevertitle_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Title Screen\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Title Screen</div></div></div></div><p>Batman Forever begins with a robbery and hostage situation by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/two-face/29-5555/\">Two-Face</a> (Harvey Dent, former District Attorney and friend to Bruce Wayne. A gangster threw acid at him and he was able to cover half his face, leaving only half of it scarred. He was driven mad and developed the need to make all his decisions based on the flip of a coin. Heads for good, tails for evil). After a fight with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>, Two-Face escapes. Soon after we are introduced to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/riddler/29-3718/\">Edward Nygma</a>, a mad scientist of sorts employed at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wayne-enterprises/65-51471/\">Wayne Enterprises</a>. He approaches Bruce Wayne and with his machine that can beam television straight into a person\u2019s brain. rejects the invention on the notion that in the wrong hands the technology could have malicious applications. This sends Nygma over the edge; he kills his supervisor and makes it appear a suicide and resigns from his post due to grief over his death.</p><p>Soon after this Bruce Wayne meets psychiatrist Chase Meridan (although Batman met her previously at the Two-Face hostage incident). Bruce invites her to a charity event held at a circus. Two-Face coincidentally crashes the event in an attempt to force the high-ranking elite to surrender Batman\u2019s secret identity, else he will blow up the circus. He kills the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flying-graysons/65-55863/\">Flying Graysons</a> (an acrobat-family in the circus) while making his demands. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Dick Grayson</a> (the youngest) survives and even removes the explosive device, then returns to find his parents dead. Bruce takes Dick in and lets him stay at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wayne-manor/34-55767/\">Wayne Manor</a> as long as he wants. Dick, however says he is not interested, but is dissuaded by Bruce and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alfred/29-5556/\">Alfred</a>. He then declares that he is going to kill Two-Face and get revenge on the killer of his family, and when he accidentally discovers Bruce in the Batcave he wants to become Batman\u2019s partner.</p><p>Edward has come to blame Bruce for rejecting his invention and becomes obsessed with making him pay. He begins leaving unsigned riddles for Bruce and becomes a criminal calling himself \u201cThe Riddler\u201d. He locates Two-Face and persuades him to become allies. Edward realizes he can use his invention to read minds and also literally the IQ of anyone who uses it. It is unknown exactly how this works, as it does not make the victim less intelligent, only Nygma moreso. Two-Face and Riddler begin a string of robberies, their goal being the mass production of Edward\u2019s device. During a party for the success of his device on the market, Riddler reads Bruce Wayne\u2019s mind and finds he has \u2018bats on the brain.\u2019 He deduces is Batman moments before Two-Face crashes and robs the party. Two-Face nearly kills Batman, but Dick arrives in the nick of time to save him. Two-Face and Riddler assault the Manor soon after. Riddler destroys most of the equipment in the Batcave, while Two-Face flips his coin to decide whether he can shoot Bruce. It comes up saying no, and Two-Face flips again and again until it finally says yes and he shoots Bruce, but not fatally. The two villains then proceed to kidnap Dr. Chase. Before he leaves, however, Riddler leaves Bruce one last riddle. Bruce and Alfred later solve the riddles, finding they are all together a number/alphabet riddle which spells \u201cMr. E\u201d a pun on \u201cmystery\u201d which is a synonym for \u201cenigma\u201d. Bruce realizes that enigma can also be read \u201cE. Nygma\u201d as in Edward Nygma.</p><p>After this, Batman and the newly christened Robin attack Riddler\u2019s island-base. They avoid his sea mines, evil frogmen and anti-aircraft beam and approach the Riddler\u2019s hideout. The two are separated upon reaching the island. Robin finds himself facing Two-Face and defeats him. Two-Face falls over a ledge and holds on barely, pleading for his life. Robin searches himself and finds he cannot kill Two-Face, then helps him up. Two-Face takes his advantage and captures Robin with his pistol. Batman, meanwhile, makes his way to the inner part of the lair and finds the Riddler himself. Riddler then reveals Robin and Dr. Chase, both tied, gagged and caged, and offers Batman the chance to save one of them by letting the other die. Riddler is trying to destroy Batman by proving he cannot be both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Batman asks Riddler a fairly simple riddle, the answer to which is \u2018bat\u2019, and buys himself enough time to draw a Sonar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batarang/18-46297/\">Batarang</a> and destroy the core of the system connecting all of Riddler\u2019s machines, which is also connected directly to Riddler\u2019s brain. The backlash of the machine drives Riddler instantly insane, however he manages to drop Chase and Robin into a pit filled with water and sharp metal. Batman manages to rescue both and swings them onto a ledge in the middle of the pit. Two-Face then appears and flips his coin, hoping to kill all three of htem. Batman throws several coins up to confuse Two-Face, who cannot keep track of his own coin and loses his balance. He falls to his death at the bottom of the pit. The insane Riddler is packed off to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arkham-asylum/34-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a> and Chase consults on his case. Riddler offers to reveal Batman\u2019s identity to her, but then begins raving madly that <i>he</i> is Batman. Bruce meets Chase outside and she informs him that Nygma is in no position to tell anyone Bruce is Batman. The end of the movie shows Batman <i>and</i> Robin running off to another crime.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The movie starts off with Batman and Robin plumetting into action, trying to stop Mr. Freeze from stealing a very large diamond. A battle ensues, with Batman and Robin pitted against Mr. Freeze and his henchmen at a museum. The Bat-Duo fails to stop Mr. Freeze when Robin gets ahead of himself and ends up getting frozen by Mr. Freeze, allowing him to escape while Batman tries to thaw Robin.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Pamela Isley, a botanist, discovers that her boss, Dr. Woodrue, is using her venoms to create a criminal called Bane. He kills her for discovering this secret; however, she survives the poisons that are intoxicating her and kills Woodrue after she reawakens.</p><p>Back at the Batcave, Batman and Robin are doing research on Mr. Freeze. Alfred has begun to show signs of fatigue, apparently due to his old age. The next day, Alfred\u2019s niece, Barbara Wilson, drops by on a surprise visit. The day after that, Bruce unveils a new powerful telescope for which he has donated the funds. This is where Pamela Isley forces her way up to ask Bruce for funding, which he rejects. Later, Bruce decides to conduct a diamond auction in an attempt to lure Mr. Freeze into a trap. However, Poison Ivy comes in and mesmerizes everyone with her spores. Mr. Freeze comes in to steal the diamond, and with Poison Ivy there already, it distracts Batman and Robin from capturing Mr. Freeze. However, the duo go after him anyway. Batman disables Robin\u2019s bike from jumping a bridge. Batman jumps the bridge himself and is able to land on Mr. Freeze and arrest him. Back at the Batcave, Robin gets into an argument about trust with Batman.</p><p>While Dick is doing some research in the Batcave, he catches Barbara sneaking out with a motorcycle and decides to follow her this time. He follows her to an underground motorcycle race, and participates himself. But he ends up saving Barbara from falling off the bridge when the biker gang trips her. Back at the mansion, Barbara reveals to Dick that she wants to take Alfred away from his life of servitude. Bruce then reveals to Dick that Alfred is dying.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Arkham Asylum, Poison Ivy breaks in to free Mr. Freeze in order for them to team up. Dick then alerts Bruce that Mr. Freeze has escaped, and the Bat-Duo rushes over to Mr. Freeze\u2019s former hideout. Batman and Robin go deeper into Mr. Freeze\u2019s hideout, where they encounter Bane and Poison Ivy. The Bat-Duo ends up fighting each other instead, giving Ivy and Bane enough time to escape. When Ivy returns to her own hideout, she tells Mr. Freeze that Batman killed his wife, when in fact it was Ivy who did it. Back at the mansion, the doctor reveals that Alfred has stage 1 of MacGreggor\u2019s syndrome, which is the same stage to which Freeze already has the cure. Later, after Alfred gives Barbara a CD containing secrets and telling her to give it to Alfred\u2019s brother, Barbara tries to hack into it to see what it is. She is eventually successful and discovers the secrets about Batman and Robin.</p><p>Later that night, Bruce is finally able to convince Dick to trust him before he goes to see Poison Ivy. Meanwhile, Mr. Freeze plans to take over the telescope that Bruce Wayne had donated in order to freeze the entire city. Barbara eventually finds her way down to the Batcave, where Alfred has already tailored a Batcostume for her. Robin goes to meet Poison Ivy, who tries to poison him by kissing him. However, Robin has trusted Batman, and he had a rubber cover over his lips. Batman drops in to help him but all the vines tangle them up. Eventually, Batgirl comes and rescues the Bat-Duo.</p><p>Afterwards, the three of them rush over to try and stop Mr. Freeze. All three of them eventually fight their way to Mr. Freeze, whose plan they foil. They are able to thaw the city by using the satellites to reflect the sun towards the city. Batman also succeeds in obtaining a cure for Alfred from Mr. Freeze, and afterwards they use it on Alfred. The next morning Alfred awakens and seems to be healthy again. The film ends with Poison Ivy hallucinating inside her cell in Arkham Asylum.</p>",

        "description":"<p>The movie starts off in a flashback. Bruce was still a young child, playing in the backyard of his home with Rachel Dawes. Bruce falls into a well and into a cave, where he is attacked by a horde of bats. His dad eventually gets him out and takes him into the house, and then Bruce awakens from the dream. He is a young adult in a foreign prison, where he fights criminals one by one. Eventually Bruce meets a man named Henri Ducard, who offers him a chance to join the League of Shadows as long as he gathers a rare flower. Bruce succeeds and climbs the mountain up to Henri Ducard. After he arrives, he meets <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra\u2019s al Ghul</a> and tells Ducard about how his parent</p><p>died and the guilt and anger that he carries. Ducard begins training Bruce the way of the ninja. During the training, Bruce tells Ducard about the reason he did not avenge his parents during the trial of Joe Chill (killer of the Waynes and also the same killer in the comics), and then how he became a criminal in order to learn how they think, which is how Bruce ended up in prison in the first place. Bruce completes his final test; however, he has to execute a criminal in order to become a full member. But Bruce does not want to become an executioner. He instead flings a hot brand onto the explosives, detonating them all. Bruce fights Ra\u2019s Al Ghul until the roof collapses onto the latter. Bruce then saves Ducard from falling off the cliff, then he returns to Gotham via private jet with Alfred. Back in Gotham, Bruce discovers a huge cave underneath the mansion. Later, Bruce shows up at Wayne Enterprises, surprising all the executives because Bruce had been declared dead years ago.</p><p>Bruce asks for a job at the applied sciences department. Heading over there, he discovers the vast amount of technology there. He meets Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and gets a tour. Bruce asks to \u201cborrow\u201d the suit for cave diving. He then continues working on the cave, installing lights and then discovering more areas in the cave. Bruce then began ordering parts from dummy corporations to build himself a Bat costume. Later that night, Bruce goes out with the armor and a ski mask. He sneaks up on Officer James Gordon, and tells him about the plan to put criminals behind bars. He tells him to look for his sign.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2128354\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128354-batmanbeginsprofpic_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2128354\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128354-batmanbeginsprofpic_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Bruce eventually gets all the equipment needed to make his Bat Suit and on his first night out on patrol he encounters Carmine Falcone and his goons exporting /importing drugs with a crooked cop. Once he takes care of all Falcone's men he goes after Falcone after asking who he is he simply says \"I'm Batman.\" Afterward Gordon arrives seeing Falcone's men, but doesn't think anything of it because there is no connection to Falcone. However he learns that Falcone is on the grounds tied up to a Flood light and when Gordon looks out to see how it shines we get our first crude Bat Signal.</p><p>After Bruce''s first night out on the job, Alfred notices the bruises and advises Bruce to get an alibi for all his injuries, he suggests Polo. Dr. Crane goes to see Falcone in prison, who wants to be transferred to Arkham. We learn that Crane is working for someone and shows <a href=\"/carmine-falcone/29-42288/\">Falcone</a> the scarecrow mask. Bruce goes out to insure his Public identity as Bruce Wayne, coming across as a spoiled playboy, buying a hotel after his dates start swimming in a pool. He later goes on Patrol and finds Crane's hideout, however he is affected by the fear gas and has to flee, calling Alfred for help.</p><p>Days go by and eventually Bruce recovers, Alfred tells him Lucius Fox helped supply an antidote for the weaponized hallucinogen. Bruce asks Fox to make some more. Rachel stops by and drops off his birthday present before having to go to the Narrows to talk to Crane. Bruce rushes to his cave telling Alfred to entertain his guests until he returns.</p><p>At Arkham when Rachel asks too many questions Crane is forced to give a concentrated dose of his fear Toxin. Batman arrives and having been immunized against the toxin, uses it on Crane, who talks. He says Ra's Al Ghul is the person behind everything, including adding the toxin to the water supply. Before Batman can get anything more out of him the police arrive. The cops want to wait for SWAT but Gordon goes in anyway. Batman grabs him explaining the situation and asks him to take her and meet him out back. Once there Batman takes her to the Bat Cave, although making some additions to the nightly news on the way. When he releases Rachel from the Toxin he gives her a sedative and goes upstairs to the party. Alfred tells him he needs to be careful and not show off to which Bruce replies Rachel is downstairs, take her home. As Bruce enters the party he goes to Fox, who tells him he was just fired, but Bruce wants him back at Wayne Enterprises to make more Vaccines for the Toxin. As Bruce tries to make his way around the party he is introduced to Ra's Al Ghul, who he believes to be dead, however it turns out that Ra's is actually Ducard. Ra's tells him to either get the people out of the house or he will make a scene. Bruce takes this time to become \"drunk\" and tells his guests to get the hell out. As the guest leave Bruce sees all the Assassins in the room. Ra's tells him his plans of destroying Gotham and wants Bruce to join him. He also learns that this isn't the first time Gotham has been targeted for destruction. Bruce tells him Gotham isn't beyond saving. Ra's gives the order to his men to start burning his house, as Ra's tells him he never minded his surroundings as a beam falls on Bruce. \"You burned my house and left me for dead. Consider us even.\" As Wayne Manor is burning Alfred returns and finds Bruce helping him down to the cave.</p><p>Bruce is distraught, everything his father built is burning because of him. Alfred sees that Bruce is bleeding but tells him \"Why do we fall, Sir? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.\" A line his father told him when he was little. As Bruce heads out to save Gotham, Rachel goes to the Narrows to give Gordon his anti-Toxin. As the bridges close and the gas released Gordon is the only one left and calls for back-up. Commissioner Loeb tells him there is no one left, as Batman, in the <a href=\"../../batmobile/18-41463/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batmobile</a> jumps the gap. He has Gordon go to Wayne Tower to try to Blow up the tracks as he goes to fight Ra's. Along the way, he saves Rachel, who asks who he is. He responds \"It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\" Something she told Bruce Wayne earlier and realizes who Batman really is. As Bruce begins to fight Ra's on the train, Ra's believes he's trying to stop the train, but instead he insures that the train doesn't stop. As Gordon blows up the tracks he tells Ra's he never did mind his own surroundings. Ra's believes Bruce is going to kill him to which he replies \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.\" As he leaves Ra's on the train as it crashes.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2128359\"><div class=\"wiki-img-center\"><div class=\"wiki-img-super\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128359-batman_begins_1_1_.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2128359\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128359-batman_begins_1_1__super.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The following day Bruce hires Fox as CEO and fires the previous one. Heading back to Wayne Manor he talks to Rachel who tells him, if one day Gotham doesn't need Batman she will be there waiting for him. When asked what he will do with the Manor he replies \"Rebuild it, Brick by Brick\" exactly the way it was. Alfred tells him they could do something in the southeast corner, referring to the <a href=\"../../batcave/34-31340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat-cave</a>.</p><p>Jim Gordon has been promoted and signals Batman with a <a href=\"../../bat-signal/18-55819/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat Signal</a>, joking that he couldn't find any mob bosses. He then questions about the escalation that is going to happen because of Batman. He gives Batman a case. Double Homicide and leaves a calling card. It is revealed to be a Joker card. Batman says he'll look into it. Gordon says he never got to thank him, to which Batman replies \"and You'll never have to.\" Batman jumps off the building and circles around as the movie ends.</p><h3>Comic Book Adaptations</h3><p>1) <a href=\"/batman-begins-the-movie-and-other-tales-of-the-dark-knight/49-31294/\">Batman Begins: The Movie and Other Tales of the Dark Knight</a></p><p>2) <a href=\"/batman-begins-official-movie-adaptation/49-44587/\">Batman Begins: Official Movie Adaptation</a></p>",

        "description":"<p>In Gotham City, the Joker robs a mob bank with his accomplices, who he tricks into killing one another, ultimately killing the last one himself. That night, Batman and Lieutenant James Gordon contemplate including new district attorney Harvey Dent in their plan to eradicate the mob. However, Batman questions if Dent can be trusted. Bruce runs into Rachel Dawes and Dent, who are dating, and after talking to Dent, he realizes Dent's sincerity and decides to host a fundraiser for him. Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and the Chechen meet with other underworld gangsters to discuss both Batman and Dent, who have been cracking down on the mobster's operations. Lau, a Chinese mafia accountant, informs them that he has hidden their money and fled to Hong Kong in an attempt to preempt Gordon's plan to seize the mobsters' funds and hide from Dent's jurisdiction. The Joker appears and offers to kill Batman for half of the mafia's money, but they flatly refuse and Gambol places a bounty on the Joker's head. Not long after, the Joker kills Gambol and takes control of his men.</p><p>In Hong Kong, Batman captures Lau and delivers him to the Gotham City police, where Lau agrees to testify against the mob. In retaliation, the mobsters hire the Joker to kill Batman and Lau. The Joker issues an ultimatum to Gotham: people will die each day until Batman reveals his identity. When Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and Judge Surillo are murdered by corrupt police, the public readily blames Batman, prompting Bruce to decide to reveal his identity. Before Bruce can turn himself in, Dent holds a press conference to try and persuade the public not to sell Batman out just because of one terrorist, but the public, though grateful for everything Batman has done for the city, insists that things have now reached a point where Batman must make the sacrifice, so Dent announces that he himself is Batman and is arrested as part of a plan to draw the Joker out of hiding. The Joker attempts to ambush the police convoy carrying Dent, but Batman and Gordon intervene and capture him. In recognition of his actions, Gordon is appointed the new police commissioner.</p><p>Later that night, Dent and Dawes disappear. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that Dent and Dawes' police escorts were on Maroni's payroll and have placed them in warehouses rigged with explosives on opposite sides of the city \u2014 far enough apart so that Batman cannot save them both. Batman leaves to save Dawes, while Gordon and the police head after Dent. With the aid of a smuggled bomb, the Joker escapes police custody with Lau. Batman arrives, but finds Dent instead of Dawes. Batman successfully saves Dent, but the ensuing explosion disfigures Dent's face. Gordon arrives at Dawes' location too late, and she perishes when the bomb detonates. Unable to cope with this new level of chaos, Maroni goes to Gordon and offers him the Joker's location.</p><p>Aboard a cargo ship, the Joker burns Lau to death atop a pile of the mob's money, and has the Chechen killed before taking control of his men. Meanwhile, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, Coleman Reese, finds out Batman's identity and after failing to blackmail the company, decides to go public. However, realizing that he does what he does only because of Batman, The Joker changes his mind about revealing Batman's identity and issues a public ultimatum: either Reese is killed, or he will blow up a hospital. When the police refuse to carry out his demands, The Joker goes to the evacuated hospital, disguised as a nurse, and frees Dent from his restraints, convincing him to exact revenge on the people responsible for Dawes' death, as well as Batman and Gordon for not saving her. Dent begins by flipping for the Joker's life, and spares him. The Joker destroys the hospital on his way out, and then escapes with a hijacked bus full of hospital patients.</p><p>Out of the hospital, Dent goes on a personal vendetta, confronting Maroni and the corrupt cops one by one. Now with complete control over the Gotham mob, the Joker announces to the public that anyone left in Gotham at nightfall will be subject to his rule. With the bridges and tunnels out of the city closed due to a bomb threat by the Joker, authorities begin evacuating people by ferry. The Joker has explosives placed on two of the ferries\u2014one ferry with convicts, who were evacuated in an effort to keep the Joker from freeing them, and the other with civilians\u2014telling the passengers the only way to save themselves is to trigger the explosives on the other ferry; otherwise, he will destroy both at midnight. Batman locates the Joker and the hostages he has taken. Realizing the Joker has disguised the hostages as his own men, Batman is forced to attack both Gordon's SWAT team and the Joker's henchmen in order to save the real hostages.</p><p>The Joker's plan to destroy the ferries fails after the passengers on both decide not to destroy each other. Batman finds the Joker, and after a brief fight, is able to subdue him, preventing him from destroying both ferries. When Batman refuses to kill the Joker, the Joker acknowledges that Batman is truly incorruptible, but that Dent was not, and that he has unleashed Dent upon the city. Leaving the Joker for the SWAT team, Batman searches for Dent. At the remains of the building where Dawes died, Batman finds Dent holding Gordon and his family at gunpoint. Dent judges the innocence of Batman, himself, and Gordon's son through three coin tosses. As the result of the first two flips, he shoots Batman and spares himself. Before Dent can determine the boy's fate, Batman, who\u2019s body armor blocked most of the damage, tackles him over the side of the building. Gordon's son is saved, but Dent and Batman fall to the ground below resulting in Dent's death. Knowing that the citizens of Gotham will lose hope and all morale if Dent's rampage goes public, Batman convinces Gordon to hold him responsible for the murders. Police swarm the building, and Batman flees as Gordon and his son watch as Batman manages to escape the Police. Later Gordon is shown delivering the eulogy at Dent's funeral and smashing the Bat-Signal.</p>",

The terrorists imprison him in a cave along with <a href=\"/yinsen/29-7858/\">Yinsen</a>, an engineer. Slowly dying from the injuries sustained in his capture, Tony creates an electromagnet with the help of Yinsen which keeps the shrapnel away from his heart. Soon they begin work on an arc reactor and a power suit which will aid in their escape. Completing it in secret, Stark manages to escape, in the process destroying much of the terrorist base with his suit's weapons. He crashes it in the desert shortly after escaping, and is rescued.</p><p>Upon returning home, Stark insists that <a href=\"/stark-industries/65-56840/\">Stark Industries</a> cease production of weaponry, to the consternation of <a href=\"/obadiah-stane/29-31197/\">Obadiah Stane</a>, Stark's father's business partner and manager of the company, who believes this will ruin the business. Meanwhile, Stark works on creating a vastly improved version of his suit. Learning that Stark weapons are being used by the Ten Rings, and that Stane is attempting to take over control of the company, an angered Stark flies to Afghanistan and stops a Ten Rings attack on Yinsen's home village. On his return flight he is attacked by members of the <a href=\"/us-air-force/65-44417/\">US Air Force</a>, and is forced to reveal his secret identity to <a href=\"/mauler/29-13921/\">James Rhodes</a> in order to end the attack. In Afghanistan, members of the Ten Rings, working together with Stane, salvage the wrecked remains of Stark's original suit. Stane has the group destroyed, and reverse engineers a version of the suit. In pursuit of the person who is leaking Stark technology to the Ten Rings, Stark sends his assistant <a href=\"/pepper-potts/29-4263/\">Pepper Potts</a> to investigate the computer systems at Stark Industries. She learns of Stane's involvement with, and later reveals this information to <a href=\"/agent-coulson/29-70860/\">Agent Coulson</a> of <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>.</p><p>Stane, frustrated by his inability to create a working arc reactor, attacks Stark and steals his arc reactor, paralyzing him and dooming him to a slow death from the shrapnel. Stark is able to save himself using his original arc reactor. He confronts Stane wearing his armour, while Stane is similarly outfitted in his reverse engineered suit. The pair fight, and Stark is able to defeat Stane by orchestrating the overload of a massive arc reactor; Stane dies in the explosion. Stark reveals his identity as Iron Man at a press conference, contravening the orders of Agent Coulson.</p>",

        "description":"<p>An old legend of the West is that of the Ghost Rider. Supposedly, when someone sold their sold to the devil, they would be transformed into the Ghost Rider, the devil's bounty hunter. The devil's most recent Ghost Rider was around 150 years ago, but disobeyed the devil by refusing to bring him the contract of San Venganza, which would give him the power of 1000 souls.</p><p>In the present, a stunt rider called Barton Blaze and his son Johnny Blaze are carnival daredevils. Johnny is currently dating a young girl his age named Roxanne Simpson. After a show one day, Johnny goes home to find that his father is dying of cancer. That night, a mysterious man appears, and claims that he can cure Johnny's cancer, in return for Johnny's soul. Thinking it's a joke, Johnny agrees. The next day, Johnny's father is healthy once more, but during the performance that day, Johnny's father dies in an accident. Johnny finds the mysterious man who he made the deal with, and claims he's cheated on their deal, but the mysterious man points out that he saved him from the cancer as promised. He says that one day he'll come back to make sure Johnny fulfils his end of the deal.</p><p>About ten years later, Johnny is a famous stunt rider, who is famous for surviving incredibly unbelievable feats. Just before he jumps a football pitch, Johnny bumps into Roxanne Simpson again, who is now a reporter. After the show, Johnny follows Roxanne and asks her out on a date. Roxanne reluctantly agrees.</p><p>Meanwhile, the demon Blackheart is on Earth, looking for the contract of San Venganza. He enlists the aid of three demons named Gressil, Abigor, and Wallow, who represent the elements of earth, air and water respectively. The mysterious man who made the deal with Johnny is revealed to be Mephistopholes (shortened to Mephisto), Blackheart's father and a high-ranking demon. Mephisto wants the contract of San Vanganza for himself, so calls on Johnny to fulfil his end of the deal.</p><p>Johnny is turned into the latest Ghost Rider, and is sent to stop Blackheart. Blackheart, Gressil, Abigor and Wallow are at a trainyard where a graveyard used to be which held the contract of San Venganza. Ghost Rider appears, and manages to use a nearby chain to kill Gressil, although Blackheart, Abigor and Wallow escape. After the fight, Ghost Rider keeps the chain, and keeps riding. He saves a civilian from a mugger, and uses his patented Penance Stare for the first time.</p><p>The next morning, Johnny wakes up in the cemetary of a church. There, a mysterious old man tells Johnny about his curse, and a bit about how to control it. Johnny also goes home and reads a few books on how he can control it. Roxanne arrives, thinking Johnny stood her up on their date. Johnny tries to explain to Roxanne about how he turned into Ghost Rider, but she naturally doesn't believe him.</p><p>Johnny is then arrested by the police, believed to be connected to the murder at the trainyard. The police take him into a cell, where Johnny turns into Ghost Rider. He then attempts to find Blackheart, but Blackheart sends Abigor to delay him. Ghost Rider chases Abigor to the top of a building, and manages to use his chains to suck him up. While Ghost Rider is chasing Abigor, Roxanne sees him and realises Johnny was telling the truth. Roxanne is part of a crowd which watches Ghost Rider leave, and Blackheart realises she is Ghost Rider's weakness.</p><p>The next day, Johnny returns to his apartment to find that Roxanne is held captive by Blackheart and he will kill her if he doesn't get the contract of San Venganza. Johnny tries the Penance Stare on Blackheart, but it doesn't work as Blackheart has no soul.</p><p>Johnny then goes to the caretaker at the cemetary, who reveals that he was Carter Slade, the last Ghost Rider, and the one who has hidden the contract all these years. Carter gives Johnny the contract, which is hidden in his hollowed-out spade. Carter can turn into Ghost Rider one last time, and rides with Johnny to the town of San Venganza. He gives Johnny a shotgun then leaves.</p><p>Johnny approaches the town, but is ambushed by Wallow. Fortunately, he is killed by Ghost Rider's hellfire, allowing him to continue on his way. Inside the town, Johnny gives the contract to Blackheart, who then attempts to kill Ghost Rider. Johnny manages to turn the shotgun Carter gave him into a \"hellfire shotgun\", but it still isn't enough to kill Blackheart. Johnny then attempts a Penance Stare, which works this time as Blackheart has 1000 souls in him.</p><p>Mephisto then tells Johnny that he has kept his side of the bargain, and is free to go. Johnny decides that he wants to keep the Ghost Rider curse so that he can use it for good.</p><p>The film ends on Johnny and Roxanne kissing at a tree where they carved their initials when they were younger.</p>",

In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mississippi/34-56246/\">Mississippi</a>, a young girl finds herself in this very situation and runs away from home to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/canada/34-55868/\">Canada</a>. Here the young girl, named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, meets a cage fighter named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> and the two flee persecution only to be attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a>, members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Mutants</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> rescue the two, and bring them back to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters</a> to meet <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>, who explain the purpose of the X-Men. Meanwhile, Toad and a mutant named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> kidnap <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Robert Kelly</a>, a supporter of the Mutant Registration Act. Bringing him to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, their leader, the Brotherhood turns Senator Kelly into a mutant through a machine Magneto controls.</p><p>Soon, an incident at the Xavier School causes Rogue to run away, which the Brotherhood sees as an opportunity to abduct her. After a battle, Rogue is taken by the Brotherhood and brought to their base, where she learns that they intend to use her for their machine. When Senator Kelly arrives at the Xavier School and dies, the X-Men race to save Rogue. The Brotherhood takes Rogue and the machine to Ellis Island and places them in the Statue of Liberty. The X-Men arrive to fight them, but find themselves caught off guard and are quickly beaten, only for them to get their second wind and take down the Brotherhood, saving Rogue and destroying the machine.</p><p>After these events, the X-Men learn that Mystique is alive and impersonating Senator Kelly. Wolverine is sent to Alkali Lake in an attempt to learn more about his mysterious past. And finally, Professor X and Magneto meet up in Magneto's jail cell to play chess and discuss the events that are sure to come, for Magneto will continue his fight. But as Xavier says, the X-Men will always be there to stop him.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"video\"><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ZCovtVdpuIs\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></div>",

        "description":"<p>In 1998, a Blade movie was made by New Line Cinema and directed by Stephen Norrington. Wesley Snipes played Blade in the film (he was originally going to be in a <a href=\"/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a> film but it was cancelled). In the film, Blade was teamed up with <a href=\"/abraham-whistler/29-39241/\">Whistler</a> to try to find and kill <a href=\"/deacon-frost/29-13789/\">Deacon Frost</a> (played by Stephen Dorff) trying to resurrect La Magra the Blood God. While trying to look for clues on Frost, he encountered his lackey Quinn who he left to burn after a vampire rave. He was still alive, and attacked the coroners inspecting him. He also bit a woman named Karen Jenson. Blade feels sorry for what happened to her, and decides to take her back to his hideout to try and help her before she turns.</p><p>Blade also discovers that Frost needs him for the ceremony to resurrect the Blood God. After returning to his hideout, he finds Whistler is nearly dead and Karen taken hostage by Frost's men. Whistler then asked him to kill him before he turns into a vampire, Blade regrets at first but Whistler forces him to do so. So Blade walks away as Whistler kill himself. Blade then prepares for his battle with Frost, and makes his way to his hideout. After killing many familiars and vampires, he discovers his mother was still alive but now a vampire, and it was Deacon who bit her. They then knock him out and take him to the Temple of Eternal Night. He is locked into a device where his wrists are cut and his blood drips into a hole in the floor where it seeps down the to the sacrificed pure bloods and eventually Frost. Karen then arrives to free him and lets him suck her blood so he can regain his strength. His mother arrives to kill but he is able to stop her, she then says \"are you going to kill your mother\". To which he says, \"I must release you\" and kills her. In anger, he grabs his clothes and goes after Frost.</p><p>He finally kills Quinn and all of the other enemy soldiers, and finally faces Frost. Blade is able to slice off his arm and and cut him in half. but he discovers he is still alive when he reattaches his body and grows a new arm. Frost begins to beat Blade until he finds the EDTA he brought with him, and throws all of them into Frost which causes him to explode. He and Karen then leave the temple and she asks she going to make more of the antidote to cure him. But Blade says to keep and just make him a new serum to stop his thirsts. He is then seen in Russia killing a vampire as the film ends.</p>",

        "description":"Peter Parker is a shy, nerdy senior in high school. He is a brilliant scientist for his age, and lives with his elderly Uncle Ben and Aunt May, who have raised him, presumably since his parents were killed. In the first scene, Peter sees and narrates his love for Mary Jane Watson, the literal \u2018girl next door\u2019 to Peter. She is pretty and popular, the kind of girl Peter could never dream of having. Peter\u2019s best friend is Harry Osborn, and along with being friends, the two help each other with school (usually Peter assisting Harry with math and science). Harry\u2019s father is the workaholic Norman Osborn, president of the Oscorp Manufacturing Corporation, a primary supplier of advanced weapons to the United States Army. <br />\n<p>&nbsp; <br />The first few scenes introduce us to the protagonist, Peter Parker, as well as his best friend Harry Osborn and crush Mary Jane Watson. Peter is going on a field trip with his class to a highly respected genetics lab. During the tour, someone notes a spider is missing, but the tour guide dismisses the observation, saying it\u2019s probably in testing. Peter is then bitten by the spider (although he does not know it is the test spider) and crushes it.<br /><br /></p>\n<p>At the lab of his company, Norman Osborn shows off his latest invention to an Army general: an advanced flying glider with various weapons that a man can ride. He then turns to what the general seems most interested in: a chemical that enhances physical human attributes to super-human levels. He tells the general the formula is ready, but his bumbling partner Dr. Stromm pipes in that it is not, as it has shown an increase in aggression and irrational violence in all test subjects. Osborn is angered by the undermining, and the general dismisses both men as well as the formula, informing Osborn of the Army\u2019s intent to pull all funding and transfer all contracts to Oscorp\u2019s biggest competitor. <br /><br />Back home, Ben and May are discussing money issues when Peter arrives and goes upstairs, claiming he feels ill. He passes out on the floor and has confusing dreams. We zoom in on his DNA, seeing it transform to that of a spider. <br /><br />Meanwhile, back at Oscorp, Osborn is proceeding to human testing, but without approval from anyone he has only one test subject: himself. He proceeds to ignore Stromm\u2019s protests. When the test goes awry, he loses his mind and kills Stromm in a fit of rage.<br /><br />The next day, Parker rushes out of to the bus and finds that, as he bangs on the side, the banner sticks to his unclenched hand. Later, during lunch of the same day, he sits down at a table in the cafeteria. Watson passes him, and in Parker's mind he sees her slipping on a puddle, falling back and throwing her lunch into the air.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;reacts almost before it happens and catches her, then her tray, then all of her lunch items on the tray. They have a short conversation, and then Mary Jane goes back to her popular friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;tries to put down a fork, but finds that it too is stuck to his hand. He pulls it off with his other hand and finds a strand of webbing shoots out of his wrist. It snags a tray of food, and&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;jerks it, trying to detach the webbing. It instead pulls the whole tray, which lands on Flash and covers him in food.&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;quickly gets up and exits, only to drag the tray behind him by his webbing. Flash looks around for whoever hit him with a lunch and sees&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;exit.</p>\n<p><br />The two fight outside and&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;easily bests him, watching the punches fly by his head.&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;flees his school and finds that he can crawl up walls and has incredible agility, as well as an organic webbing he can use to swing from building to building. Later,&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;takes out the trash and has a conversation with MJ; it is cut short, however, by her boyfriend driving up in his fancy new sports car. The next few scenes show&nbsp;&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;practicing his new abilities and designing a basic costume. He also looks in the paper and sees several car ads. They are all very expensive. He then sees an ad for a fight club, offering $3,000 for anyone who can last three minutes with the champion.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Parker&nbsp;has a heated argument with Uncle Ben on his way to the fight club. After he gets there, he easily bests the champion in less than two minutes. When he goes to collect his winnings, the promoter refuses to pay him. As&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;turns to leave, the promoter is robbed, and&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;lets the thief walk right past him in revenge. Later,&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;sees Uncle Ben in the middle of a crowd. Ben has been shot.&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;holds Ben until he dies, then overhears two cops saying they\u2019ve found the killer and are chasing him.&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;quickly joins the chase and catches the guy, recognizing him as the thief from the fight club.&nbsp;Parker&nbsp;realizes if he\u2019d done the right thing Ben would still be alive. During their fight, the thief trips and falls out of a window, to his death.&nbsp;</p><br />\n<p>Later in the night, the general that fired Osborn and Oscorp is at a demonstration at the competitor\u2019s facility. A masked and cackling figure comes out of the sky and kills them all. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;<br />Soon after graduation, Parker moves into an apartment with Harry and designs a new Spider-Man outfit. He assumes his identity as the protector of New York. He begins taking pictures of himself as Spidey for the Daily Bugle, only to find their unscrupulous editor J. Jonah Jameson is using the pictures and headlines to paint Spider-Man as a menace to the city. Also, Parker discovers that Harry and MJ are dating, but does not tell Harry he knows. </p>\n<p>Osborn\u2019s company decides to sell out to their competitor, but also fires him. At a large parade a day or so after, all the members of the Oscorp board, as well as Parker, MJ and Harry, are attending. During the parade, the masked figure kills all the board members and attacks Mary Jane, but is defeated by Spider-Man. The villain slinks off to lick his wounds. </p>\n<p><br />The next day, Parker goes to deliver his pictures of the festival and of the fight to Jameson, who has just named the villain the Green Goblin. Just as Parker leaves, the Goblin attacks, trying to find a link to Spider-Man. Spidey shows up to save Jameson, but is captured by the Goblin, who tries to talk him into becoming his partner. Spider-Man refuses and the Goblin lets him go, telling him the city will turn against him sooner or later. </p>\n<p>Soon after, MJ is attacked and saved by Spider-Man, and the two share a passionate kiss. Spider-Man then goes to save someone from a burning building, but finds it is the Goblin, who attacks and injures him. Both escape and switch into their secret identities. They then both go to a dinner with the Parkers, Osborns and Watson all in attendance. During the meal, Osborn sees Parker's scratch and realizes he is Spider-Man, but says nothing. Later that night, &nbsp;he and the Goblin argue with each other about how to deal with Spider-Man. In the end, they decide to kill those close to him and then Spidey himself. Goblin attacks May but does no permanent damage, and then kidnaps MJ. Spider-Man finds him and barely saves MJ and a few civilians the Goblin also endangered. The Goblin then drags Parker off to a new location where the two fight; Parker emerges victorious. Osborn reveals his true identity and presses a button on his suit, which positions his glider silently behind Spider-Man. He then hits another button and it flies forward, but Parker dodges and it kills the Goblin instead. His last words are a request that Parker not tell Harry about his alter ego. </p>\n<p>Parker delivers Osborn\u2019s body to the Osborn residence, but Harry catches him. However, he only sees the Spider-Man outfit and vows to make Spider-Man pay, thinking he killed his father. The last scene of the movie is the funeral, at which MJ tells Parker she loves him. However, he has realized that if any of his enemies find out his identity, being close is only endagering her. Parker tells MJ he does not love her, so he can continue being Spider-Man without endangering her. </p>",

        "description":"<p>After the traumatic events of the previous film, Spider-man (Tobey Maguire) continues his duties as the Spectacular Spider-man whilst still trying to form a relationship with the beautiful Mary Jane Watson. (Kirsten Dunst)&nbsp;Peter starts to learn what he must sacrifice in order to fulfill his duties as Spider-man, as his attendence at college starts slipping.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Peters lecturer Dr. Curt Conners (Dylan Baker) organises for his dear friend and former colleague Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) to meet with Peter in terms of teaching purposes as well as hopes to teach some dicipline.&nbsp;Peter joins Dr. Octavius and his wife where the Doctor explains his profound love for his wife and the promising results his new experiment with tridium may create.&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Mary Jane is audtioning for music productions just off broadway with high hopes for Peter to watch her. When Peters responsibility of Spider-man rears its head, he misses Mary Janes shows and in the process she falls for John Jameson (Daniel Gillies) the son of Peters harsh and arrogant boss of the daily bugle; J Jonah Jameson. (J. K. Simmons) While his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) starts to obsess over the assumption Spider-man killed his father.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Peter is left questioning whether or his responsibilites of being Spider-man is worth the trouble its causing his alter ego but reminds himself of the guilt of his uncle Ben's death. The reveal of Dr. Octavius's new experiment comes to the light of day as multiple scientists, Peter and Harry go to witness the new event. Since Harry has taken over his fathers business of Oscorp he supplies the tridium for the experiment. The doctor reveals his new equipment in order to carry out the experiment, a set of 4 mechanical arms which attach to his body. He points out a microchip that keeps him in control of them and not vice versa. The experiment starts to lose control as the tridium is added causing beams of energy to reach out of bounds and smash the ceiling and walls. Panic spreads as Harry demands for the Doctor to stop it all, but he beleives he has it all under control. When a beam of energy strikes the Doctors wife and glass kills her, Spider-Man swoops in to save Harry from impending death. Distraught that his wife has been killed, Otto turns around only to recieve an energy beam that fuses the arms to his body and fries the microchip. Spider-man tears out the energy source and stops the experiment as everyone is escorted to Hospital.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Before surgery, Otto awakes in a frenzy and kills the orderlys with his 'Tentacles' and Doctor Octopus is born.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Peter and his aunt May (Rosemary Harris) go to the bank hoping for a loan to aid them with thier financial difficulties. Doc Ock breaks into the bank by force and attempts to steal all the money in order to Re-create his experiment in an abondoned warehouse. In fear that anyone could be seriously injured including his aunt, Peter changes into Spider-man and battles Ock. Mid-battle he realises his powers aren't working properly, this gives Ock the chance to take his aunt may and climb a building. After another battle Spider-man saves his aunt, but Ock gets away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Next, Peter is heartbroken after he makes it to one of Mary Janes shows and she reveals she's engaged to John Jameson. This causes Peters powers to malfunction yet again and continue to question whether being Spider-Man is worth it. Heartbroken and unsure of himself, he literally bins the suit and tries to focus on his social life instead. Meanwhile, Doc Ock invades Oscorp and attacks Harry Osborn in hopes of stealing the vital Tridium he can supply. Upon realisation he has none, Harry strikes a deal that if Doc Ock can bring Spider-Man to him alive, he will gather enough Tridium as a reward. Harry gives him Peter Parkers name as he knows he takes multiple Spider-Man photos for the Daily Bugle. After Ock has left, Harry realises what he has just sent after his best friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Because of Peter's decision to give up Spider-Man, he gains a newfound confidence. He decides to share his secret identity with Mary Jane. A passionate talk at a cafe' is disturbed as Doc Ock breaks in stealing Mary Jane away. This forces Peter to pick up his costume (Now as the Daily Bugle, much to J Jonah Jamesons discontent) and chase Ock. They meet on a train and fight an incredibly grueling battle. Ock destroys the Train controls and escapes leaving Spider-Man to save everyone on board. Using his webs, he stops the train but passes out due to exhaustion. He is unmasked by the train passengers who are shocked to see he is only a young man. Ock returns and sucker punches Spidey only to whisk him away.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />At Oscorp, Spidey is dropped off for Harry and lays unconscious upon a table, Ock leaves with his Tridium. Harry, wielding a knife unmasked Spidey only to learn he is actually his best friend Peter. Peter wakes up and informs Harry theres no time to explain, Mary janes been kidnapped. Harry, shocked lets him go. As Peter goes off as Spider-Man in search for Ock, Harry hallucinates and see's his father talking to him, pointing him to his hidden laboratory. Harry walks through to discover the Goblin Serum, glider and masks.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />When Spidey finds Ock, the experiment has begun. The final battle insues which results in Spidey's mask being torn, revealing his face. Mary Jane notices this during the fight. Ock is hit hard as the experiment starts to lose control. Peter reasons with Ock and begs him to stop it, he reveals it can't be stopped only drowned. As Spidey saves Mary Jane, Ock tears down the experiment and the whole warehouse with it. Stopping the reaction, but drowning himself in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Without a chance to talk, Spidey lets Mary Jane go, and run into her fiancee's arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />The next day Peter refuses to go to Mary Janes wedding but is suprised as she shows up at his flat. After sharing a kiss, its revealed she left John for Peter. Unfortunately for Peter, Police sirens are heard, looking at Mary Jane she smiles and utters the famous line 'Go Get 'em Tiger'.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Film ends as Spidey swings from his flat window with Mary Jane Looking on. </p>",

        "description":"<p>5 years ago, Bruce Banner, a military scientist, attempted to recreate the super soldier serum. Unfortunately, he is now on the run from the U.S. military, who want to capture the Hulk and use him as a weapon. At the moment, Bruce is living in Brazil, and communicating over the internet with someone known only as \"Mr. Blue\", in the hopes of a cure for his condition. When not looking for a cure, he works at a bottling plant.</p><p>Unfortunately for Bruce, some of his gamma-infected blood falls into a bottle at work one day, which kills the old man who ends up drinking the bottle. General \"Thunderbolt\" Ross deduces that Banner must be at the bottling plant, so he sends in a special team to get him, led by a Russian named Emil Blonsky. When the team finds Bruce, he ends up having to transform to the Hulk to escape. All of the soldiers except Blonsky are killed.</p><p>In order to get more research for Mr. Blue, Bruce has to return to his university in Virginia, where he first did his research. While he's there, he accidentally bumps into Betty Ross, who he was dating a few years ago. On the day that Bruce is ready to leave the university, he is attacked by the army once more, who want the Hulk. With them is Blonsky, who has taken an experimental super soldier serum and is now faster and stronger than before. Despite this, the Hulk still manages to stop him.</p><p>Betty and Bruce go on the run, and end up going to New York to meet Mr. Blue. Mr. Blue turns out to be a scientist named Samuel Sterns, who believes he has made a successful cure. They manage to get Bruce to transform to the Hulk, where the cure is tested and is successful. Sterns then reveals that he synthesized a sample of Bruce's blood that was sent to him, which he intends to use to help evolve mankind. Bruce is appalled by this and tries to convince him to destroy it, but the Army arrives and Bruce is captured.</p><p>When the Army leaves Sterns, Emil Blonsky bursts in and demands the gamma treatment that Sterns has made from Bruce's blood, as he wants the power of the Hulk. Sterns is reluctant at first, as the experimental super-soldier serum combined with the gamma treatment could mutate him in unexpected ways, but after Blonsky starts threatening him Sterns gives him the treatment. As Sterns predicted, the treatment mutates him, into something with the Hulk's strength but Blonsky's intelligence. As he leaves, Blonsky hits Sterns across the room, which makes some of the gamma treatment drip into Sterns' head.</p><p>Bruce convinces General Ross that he is the only person who can stop Blonsky, and is let out of the helicopter they are in. He falls to the ground and manages to transform to the Hulk just in time, as the cure wasn't completely perfect. The Hulk and Blonsky then battle, and the Hulk almost loses, before managing to get the upper hand. He then flees.</p><p>Thirty-one days later, Bruce is attempting to gain control of his transformations willingly. At the same time as he attempts this, General Ross is told by Tony Stark that a team is being put together.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"video\"><object height=\"344\" width=\"425\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3-denWmVo1Y&amp;feature=related\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"transparent\"><embed src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/3-denWmVo1Y&amp;feature=related\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" wmode=\"transparent\" height=\"344\" width=\"425\"></embed></param></object></div>",

        "description":"In 1944, as a last-ditch attempt to win the war, the Nazis hired the undead Russian mystic <a href=\"/grigori-efimovich-rasputin/29-5482/\">                Grigori Rasputin</a> to open up an inter-dimensional portal in order to awaken the <a href=\"/ogdru-jahad/29-60131/\">                 Ogdru Jahad</a>, merciless entities that had been imprisoned. Rasputin actually planned to use them to meet his own ends - to destroy the world. Also present at the ritual are the immortal<a href=\"/ilsa-haupstein/29-5500/\">              Ilsa Haupstein</a> and Nazi Lieutenant Colonel <a href=\"/kroenen/29-5528/\">           Karl Ruprecht Kroenen</a>. Shortly thereafter, a small team from the United States Army interrupts, aided by <a href=\"/trevor-bruttenholm/29-5478/\">          Professor Trevor Broom</a>. In the ensuing fight, Rasputin is seemingly killed and the portal is destroyed, with Llsa and Kroenen narrowly escaping. After searching the grounds, the team find a small, red demon-boy with a right hand made of stone. Professor Broom lures the demon-boy towards him with a candy bar, and takes him in, eventually naming him <a href=\"/hellboy/29-5466/\">         Hellboy</a>.&nbsp; <br /><br />Sixty years pass, and the young FBI agent, John Myers, arrives at the <a href=\"/bureau-for-paranormal-research-and-defense/65-40436/\">        Bureau  for Paranormal Research and Defense</a> , which is operated by Broom. He is introduced to agents <a href=\"/abe-sapien/29-25795/\">      Abe Sapien</a> (an amphibious man with psychic abilities) and Liz Sherman (a pyrokinetic). Liz is yet to gain control over her powers, and as a result has often been admitted to psychiatric care.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Ilsa and Kroenen resurrect Rasputin. They travel to New York's Machen Library of Paranormal Artifacts to manipulate a statue and release a vicious hell-hound known as Sammael. With his magical powers, Rasutin gives Sammael the ability to regenerate - when one hound dies, two are born and grown within minutes. He then visits Liz at the mental hospital and reactivates her powers. This causes her to burn down the hospital in her sleep. After a chat with Myers, she later returns to the Bureau. <br />&nbsp;<br />After encountering Sammael, Hellboy kills it repeatedly, which in turn creates dozens more. The team is sent to track the hounds in the sewers of New York, but the endeavor ends badly with Abe and two agents injured, and another two dead. As Kroenen's undead body is run by clockwork, he uses his ability to shut himself down to appear dead. His body is brought to the Bureau to be examined. After witnessing an argument between Hellboy and FBI Director <a href=\"/tom-manning/29-42719/\">    Tom Manning</a>, Liz is frustrated and goes out for coffee with Myers. This leaves Hellboy jealous and he secretly follows them.&nbsp; <br /><br />Back at the Bureau, Rasputin revives Kroenen and they go after Broom. Before killing him, Rasputin shows Broom a future featuring Hellboy as destroyer of the world, his destiny. <br />&nbsp;<br />Under the guidance of Manning, the BPRD team go to Rasputin's mausoleum, where they soon are separated. Hellboy and Manning arrive at Kroenen's lair, where they team up to defeat him. Leaving Manning behind, Hellboy reunites with Liz and Myers in Sammael's nest. With Hellboy overhelmed by the vast numbers of hounds that are attacking him, Liz has no choice but to overcome her fears and use her powers to destroy the beasts and their eggs. But the blast is so powerful that Myers, Liz&nbsp; and Hellboy are knocked unconsious and captured by Rasputin. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the catacombs, Rasputin plans to use Hellboy to release the Ogdru Jahad. To force Hellboy to comply, he sucks out Liz's soul, promising to reverse the action if Hellboy does as he asks. As he does not want to harm Liz, Hellboy agrees, and unleashes the inner power of Anung Un Rama. Witnessing this, Myers attempts to remind Hellboy of whom he is before he releases the Ogdru Jahad, and that he has a choice. Remembering whom Professor Broom had brought him up to be, Hellboy snaps off his horns and prevents the Ogdru Jahad from being released. Furious, Rasputin screams with rage but Hellboy stabs him with one of his horns. <br />&nbsp;<br />However, Rasputin turns into the enormous Behemoth, a creature of the Ogdru Jahad. Hellboy attempts to defeat the monster with a sword from a stone statue, but realizes the only way to win is to allow himself to be swallowed whilst detonating a belt of live hand grenades. After killing the monster, Hellboy returns to Liz, who appears to be dead, but he whispers in her ear and she awakens. Hellboy subsequently tells her that he restored her soul by telling the creatures on the other side that they'll 'be sorry' if they don't let it go. The couple embrace surrounded by flames as Myers, in a voice over, states that what truly makes a man a man is 'not how he starts things, but how he decides to end them'.",

        "description":"<p>The film starts with a flashback to Christmas, 1955, when <a href=\"/trevor-bruttenholm/29-5478/\">Trevor Broom</a> tells the young <a href=\"/hellboy/29-5466/\">Hellboy</a> a bedtime story about a battle between man and elves. After years of fighting, elf <a href=\"/prince-nuada/29-55451/\">Prince Nuada</a> convinces his father, King Balor to have blacksmiths build an indestructible golden clockwork army controlled by a golden crown. The <a href=\"/the-golden-army/65-56593/\">Golden Army</a> proved to be so effective against the humans that Balor created a truce with the humans to prevent more carnage from happening. They agreed that the humans would keep to their cities and the magical creatures to their forests. This enraged the Prince, and he left in exile. The crown was broken into three pieces - one was given to the humans, and the other two kept by the elves - so that the Golden Army would never be used again, remaining dormant for hundreds of years.</p><p>In the present, Nuada, still bitter over his father's truce, declares war on the humans. After finding out the location of the first piece of crown at an auction house, he kills all humans present by releasing vicious tooth fairies upon them. The then kills his father and takes the second piece of crown. The final piece remains safe with his twin sister, Nuala. Hellboy and the <a href=\"/bureau-for-paranormal-research-and-defense/65-40436/\">B.P.R.D.</a> quickly investigate the mysterious massacre at the auction house, where <a href=\"/abe-sapien/29-25795/\">Abe</a> finds out that <a href=\"/elizabeth-sherman/29-5475/\">Liz</a> is pregnant with Hellboy's child. Hellboy, who is frustrated that the B.P.R.D. must remain a secret, reveals himself to the world by allowing himself to be pushed out of a window.</p><p>Upon hearing the news of Hellboy's public display, Washington sends a new agent to take charge of the B.P.R.D., <a href=\"/johann-kraus/29-5479/\">Johann Krauss</a>. Krauss is a medium who lost his body during a seance; his ectoplasm is therefore contained in a special suit. Krauss and the team discover that the tooth fairies had been purchased at a troll market which is located under Brooklyn Bridge. The team goes there to search for more clues, and in the process Abe encounters <a href=\"/princess-nuala/29-55450/\">Princess Nuala</a>, with whom he quickly falls in love. Nuala has obtained a map that leads to the Golden Army. Prince Nuada, however, attempts to stop the team and the Princess from escaping and sends his troll after them. Hellboy subdues the troll, but Nuada attacks with an enourmous magical creature, the Elemental, which proves more difficult to defeat. During the fight, Nuada taunts Hellboy and questions his affiliation with the humans as they, too, treat him like a monster.</p><p>Despite their eventual escape, Nuada tracks the team back to the B.P.R.D. headquarters using the magical bond between himself and his sister. Nuala senses her brother's approach and hides the final piece of crown in a book, throwing the map and its container into the fire. However, upon arriving, Nuala plucks the map's container out of the fire, revealing that the map is visible on the canister. Abe and Hellboy, who had been drinking, arrive to save the Princess, but fail because they were drunk. During the encounter, Nuala implants a deadly blade into Hellboy's chest which edges closer to his heart as the minutes pass, and he kidnaps his sister.</p><p>The team takes the mortally wounded Hellboy to the location of the Golden Army in Northern Ireland, where they convince a Bethmoora goblin to take them to the angel of death. The angel of death warns Liz that Hellboy is destined to doom humanity, but Liz pleads for Hellboy's life. The angel eventually removes the blade from Hellboy's chest and tells Liz to give him a reason to live. Hellboy awakens when she tells him of her pregancy.</p><p>Nuada is awaiting the arrival of Hellboy and the team at the hall that the Golden Army rests in. He bargains with Abe and exchanges Nuala for the last piece of crown. Nuala awakens the Army using the completed crown, and a battle ensues. After believing they had won the fight, the team is horrified when the Army begins to piece itself back together with ease. At this point, Hellboy remembers he is of royal blood (as the Son of the Fallen One, a Prince of Sheol), and uses his status to challenge Nuada. After subduing Nuada, Hellboy nobally lets him live, only for Nuada to try to stab him when he turns his back. Nuala sacrifices her life to stop her brother - their sibling bond means that anything that happens to her, also happens to the Prince. Abe rushes to Nuala's side and tells him of his feelings for her before she and her brother turn to stone. Using her pyrokinetic powers, Liz melts the crown, and the Golden Army is once again made dormant.</p><p>When they leave the underground compound, <a href=\"/tom-manning/29-42719/\">Tom Manning</a> is angry at them for going to Ireland without being ordered to do so, but Hellboy, Liz, Abe and Kraus let him know that they're all resigning from the B.P.R.D.. As they walk away, Hellboy and Liz talk about their future with their baby, at which Liz points out she is actually having twins.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Peter Parker and Spider-Man are both on top of the world at the start of the movie. Spider-Man is extremely popular and Peter Parker has got the girl, the photo\u2019s and is even making it to Mary Jane\u2019s new Broadway Starring show. However not everyone is okay with that. At the opening night of the show, Harry Osborn is shown in the balcony looking at MJ and down towards Peter. After the show, Peter spots Harry, but Harry wants nothing to do with him. Peter then goes backstage to see MJ, who is clearly extremely excited after her first night on Broadway. The two have a date in the park where they look at the stars while in the comfort of Peter\u2019s webbing. As they watch, a meteorite crashes in the park and an extra-terrestrial symbiote oozes out of the rock. Before Peter and MJ leave the park, it attaches itself to the back of his bike.</p><p>Meanwhile it appears that Harry has taken the Goblin Serum as he looks towards his table of updated equipment. Also, in an unidentified apartment, a man, seemingly an escaped convict enters a bedroom of a young girl. It is revealed that this girl is his daughter and that he has escaped prison. His daughter is very sick and his wife wants nothing to do with him. His name is Flint Marko and he claims he was wrongfully accused of a crime he did not commit. He promises to get his wife the money they need for their daughter, but she yells for him to leave.</p><p>Peter then goes to visit Aunt May and tells her he wants to propose to MJ. She tells him a man must put his wife first. Peter believes he can and Aunt May gives him the ring that Uncle Ben proposed to her with. With the ring in his pocket, Peter rides through the city on his bike. He is then ripped off his bike by Harry on a flying glider that is more on par with a snowboard. The two fight along the rooftops and in the ensuing chaos, peter nearly loses the ring Aunt May gave him. While slinging through an alleyway, Peter sets a line that knocks Harry off his Glider, however, by doing so injures Harry to the point where he has temporary amnesia. Peter takes him to the hospital where he acts like the man he was before his father died.</p><p>The Police have caught up with Flint Marko and basically have him cornered in a facility. While running away, he falls into a sand pit that is actually a particle accelerator. With no escape Flint is caught in the research field, unbeknownst to anyone. He disintegrates into the sand. However, the next day, seemingly, a sand figure emerges. He learns how to control the power he has been given.</p><p>MJ\u2019s play doesn\u2019t get a favorable review, particularly MJ herself. She is hurt by the paper\u2019s assessment of her talent. Peter, in an attempt to comfort her comes across as a little arrogant when he talks about overcoming criticism as Spider-Man. When he realizes this he tries to comfort her, but there is trouble and Spider-Man is needed. The black symbiote now is in Peter\u2019s apartment.</p><p>An out of control crane crashes into a building that has a photo shoot going on. It is revealed that the photo shoot is of one of Peter\u2019s classmates, Gwen Stacy. The crane crashes into the building, causing a partial collapse. Meanwhile on the ground Police Captain Stacy is introduced to Gwen\u2019s supposed boyfriend, Eddie Brock, a rival photographer to Peter Parker. After Spider-Man saves Gwen from falling off the building, Brock tries to approach him stating that he is the new photographer in town. Spider-Man is not a fan of this. Later, when Peter arrives to sell the pictures to J. Jonah Jameson, Brock is there and has his pictures chosen over Peter\u2019s. Brock and Peter are then told that there is a staff opening for photographer, Jameson tells them that whoever gets a picture of Spider-Man committing a crime will get the job.</p><p>Later at a ceremony honoring Spider-Man for saving Gwen, he re-enacts the kiss that MJ and him first shared with Gwen, while MJ looks on. In the middle of the ceremony it is reported that there is a bank robbery. Sandman robs a bank and Spider-Man is unsuccessful in apprehending him.</p><p>Later that night Peter prepares to propose to Mary Jane at this fancy French restaurant. His plans for proposing don\u2019t go so well. Mary Jane is already a little frustrated as she had been fired from her show. When she arrives, Gwen Stacey stops by the table to thank Peter for helping her in class and introduces herself to MJ as Peter\u2019s lab partner. Once she leaves Mary Jane wonders if he is pushing her away. She is furious that he shared their kiss with another woman. She leaves the restaurant in a fury and Peter fails to propose.</p><p>The next day Peter tries to call her, however she ignores his calls and his message. Police Captain Stacey then calls Peter and Aunt May into the Police Station. It is revealed that Peter\u2019s Uncle was killed by another man. This man is revealed to be Flint Marko, the Sandman. Peter begins obsessing over finding Marko, sitting in his costume listening to the police radio. When Mary Jane comes to visit him, he does push her away. She tells him everyone needs help, even Spider-Man. As Peter falls asleep listening to the Radio, the Symbiote, crawls towards him and covers his costume. Peter wakes up hanging upside down on a skyscraper with no knowledge of how he got there or where this new suit came from.</p><p>Curious about the suit, Peter brings a sample to his friend and professor, Curt Conners. Dr. Conners warns him of its symbiotic behavior. He tells him not to get any on him. Once home, he hears of Marko robbing a bank over the police wire. Instead of opting for his traditional red and blues, he goes for the dark black suit in order to apprehend him. As he catches up to Sandman, the suit starts feeding and fueling his anger towards Sandman. His strength increases as well as his recklessness. When Brock tries to take a picture of Spider-Man in his new costume, he smashes his camera. Brock pulls out a digital camera and takes some pictures. Meanwhile Spider-Man has followed Sandman underground and seemingly dorwns him with a surplus of water.</p><p>The suit continues to feed on Peter, making him easily moody. When his land lord asks for his rent, he outbursts angrily and slams the door uncharacteristically. Peter becomes aware of his behavior and takes the suit off and goes to visit Aunt May to tell her that Spider-Man killed Marko. She warns Peter that revenge is like a poison.</p><p>Meanwhile Mary Jane is feeling lonely and instead of calling Peter she calls Harry. The two banter playfully in his house. While cooking an omelet the two share a moment that MJ immediately regrets and leaves abruptly. This causes Harry to regain his memories and his partial insanity. He sees his father and is told to attack Spider-Man\u2019s heart. Mary Jane arrives home and hears a message on the answering machine from Peter. Before she is able to answer, Harry, in his goblin attire threatens to kill Peter if she doesn\u2019t do as he tells her to do.</p><p>The next day Mary Jane and Peter meet at a park and she breaks up with him. When his pleas become too much she painfully cries there\u2019s someone else. Peter, heartbroken, goes to a caf\u00e9 to talk to Harry, where he reveals that he is the other man in her life. As Peter leaves he turns around and sees the devious look in Harry\u2019s eyes. Furiously Peter returns home and gives himself over to the Black Suit. He then confront Harry at his house and the two fight. Peter, fueled by his fury and the suit, relentlessly attacks Harry, going as far as emotionally challenging him. Harry throws one of his pumpkin bombs towards Peter, but before it explodes Peter sends it back to Harry, disfiguring his face.</p><p>The following day Peter sees a picture of Spider-Man apparently stealing from the bank that Sandman actually did. The photo is Brock\u2019s however Peter knows this didn\u2019t happen. He goes to the Bugle and confronts Brock about this, when Brock pleads with him not to say anything about the forged pictures, Peter angrily responds to the staff that they should check their sources next time. It is revealed that the picture is photo shopped and Brock is immediately fired.</p><p>Peter walks around the city with an arrogance that is not lost on some of the people around him. At the Bugle he begins to flirt with Betty Brant. Dr. Conners tells Peter that if he has any of the symbiote left he should get rid of it because it feeds on aggression. Elsewhere the Sandman begins to reform from the attack that left him a pile of mud. Later that night, Peter learns that MJ is working at a jazz club and takes Gwen there in an attempt to make her jealous. Gwen soon realizes that this is all an act for her, and she apologizes to MJ and runs out, clearly upset. Peter then tries to talk to MJ, but the bouncers are preventing that from happening. His aggression fueled by the symbiote overcomes him and he attacks the bouncers. In an effort to stop Peter, MJ is struck by him.

        "description":"<p>The film opens with Bobby Saint and Mickey Duka meet with their contact, European arms dealer Otto Krieg, during an arms deal at the Tampa, Florida seaport . The deal soon goes south as the FBI raid the deal and both Bobby and Otto are killed in the ensuing attack. Mickey is arrested on the spot but it is soon revealed that Otto Krieg was an undercover FBI agent named, Frank Castle. A former military and war vet. The sting operation was Castle's final assignment and decides to take an early retirement from the field and decides to celebrate at his father's resort in Puerto Rico. It is soon revealed at the funeral of Bobby Saint that is father is a well known crime lord, Howard Saint. Howard and his right-hand man, Quentin Glass, bribe the FBI for confidential information about Otto Krieg and find his true identity. At Bobby's funeral, Howard learns Frank is in Puerto Rico before leaving for London afterwards.. Howard orders Frank murdered, but his conniving wife, Livia, demands that they kill Frank's entire family as well to \"settle the score\".</p><p>in Puerto Rico, Saint's men, along with Bobby's twin brother, Tommy attack Castle's family and kill everyone at the home and Frank is shot and blown off the pier and left to drown in the ocean by Glass. He however, washes up on shore alive and finds a black shirt that his son was making him, which now has the form of a skull on the front of the shirt. Later, o nce his injuries are fully healed, Frank returns to Tampa and takes refuge in an old tenement building where three young outcasts named, Dave, Bumpo and Joan live. Frank kidnaps Mickey Duka and at first frightens him into giving him information about the Saints, but Mickey, who hates the Saints, willingly joins Frank as a mole. Frank begins his mission of revenge after learning that the police and the FBI have been bribed by the Saints to close the investigation of his family's murder. In the process, Frank sabotages Saint's money-laundering business and severs Saint's partnership with the Cuban mobsters, the Toro Brothers, and starts tailing Livia and Quentin and learns that Quentin is gay and has been carrying on a secret affair unknown to everyone but Livia.</p><p>Frank begins to set up photos and other types of clues to make it look like Quentin is having an affair with Livia, which starts to succeed. However, Tommy discovers that Castle is in fact alive and starts sending his various agents to kill him for good. He first sends a guitar player named Harry Heck who, after a brief car chase, is killed when Frank shoots a knife into Heck's throat. The second is <a href=\"/russian/29-41663/\">the Russian</a>, a behemoth who mercilessly beats Castle in a brutal fight, but is defeated when Frank throws boiling oil in his face, which blinds him long enough for Frank to throw him down the staircase, breaking his neck. Quentin and his men eventually seek out Castle themselves and attack Frank's friends going as far as pulling out all of Dave's piercings before Castle eventually kills them all off. Howard, unaware that Quentin is gay, and believing Livia to be capable of cheating on him, kills them both personally, neither of them knowing why.</p><p>Frank then attacks Howard's headquarters, the downtown Tampa nightclub, <i>\"Saints and Sinners\"</i>, killing Howard's henchmen. He then finds John, whom he leaves to die by trapping him with an eight-pound, trip-wire activated grenade placed in his outstretched hand. Eventually, John's strength gives way and the grenade explodes, killing him as Howard hears his son crying for help. Frank wounds Howard with a pistol when Howard attempts to shoot him in the parking lot of the nightclub. Howard is then tied to a slow-moving car in the club's parking lot, but not before he reveals to Howard that Quentin and Livia were not having an affair and that he had set everyone up to see his family in both aspects die around him the same way Saint did. As Howard cries out over being tricked by Castle, several hidden bombs go off, and the destruction and wreckage culminates in the shape of Frank's iconic skull.</p><p>Not long afterwards, Frank prepares to commit suicide but after seeing a vision of his wife and son decides not to. He leaves a countless amount of cash left over from the Saint's estate to Dave, Bumpo and Joan before leaving. The final scene is Frank Castle looking over the ocean saying that he will punish crime and that Frank Castle is gone, call him: \"The Punisher\"</p>",

        "description":"<p>Conan the Barbarian was released in 1982, and starred the then-unknown Arnold Schwarzenegger. The movie was a box-office winner, and sent the actor into stardom. This film follows Conan life, from his early years as a child in Cimmeria, to a slave, to a gladiator, to a thief, and finally to the warrior and barbarian that fans know and love. His quest is one of revenge, as he moves to exact justice on the warlord and cultist Thulsa Doom, for killing his village and enslaving the barbarian.</p><p><strong>PLOT</strong></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\"><div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\"><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/conan-the-barbarian/223-59/#\">SPOILER WARNING: Click here to reveal hidden content.</a></div><div class=\"js-spoiler-div\"><p>The Wizard narrates throughout this epic tale. The film opens with narration and switches to a Young barbarian boy, and his father. We then see young Conan witness his village and family being butchered in an abrupt attack by Thulsa Doom\u2019s men. The Children of the village then become slaves and are forced to push the \u2018Wheel of Pain\u2019 (a man powered mill). Conan grows into a man pushing that mill, and in time is the only one left pushing the wheel all by himself. Soon a man comes and buys Conan to fight as a gladiator and as Conan proves his worth he is taken to the Far East and trained by the sword. One evening his master sets him free and then Conan is set on his quest of Vengeance against Doom.</p><p>Conan will soon meet Subotai and Valeria (both are thieves) and a kinship forms between the three of them. They sneak into a Temple adorned by snakes, to steal a large red jewel (The Eye of The Serpent). There is a sacrifice going on as the three enter the temple from the roof. Conan and Subotai are faced with an enormous snake that is asleep at the base of where the jewel is held. Conan retrieves the Jewel but his sweat awakes the beast. As Conan takes a jade amulet off the wall (which he recognizes as the symbol of the man who killed his family) above the exit the Snake attempts to kill him, but with the help of Subotai, Conan is able to kill it first.</p><p>Valeria and Conan become lovers. Later a King Osric of Ophir asks the group to return his daughter from Thulsa Doom, and offers them great riches in return. Separating from the group Conan meets the Wizard before he continues on to the Mountain of Power. Conan is caught as an intruder and is \u2018Crucified\u2019 by being strapped to the tree of woe in the desert. Subotai and Valeria find him and bring him back to the Wizard. Since Conan is near death Valeria agrees to pay the price to return Conan \u2013 Saying that she will rise against death to fight by his side. Conan, Subotai and Valeria enter the Mountain of power and in a battle against numerous guards retrieve the Kings daughter. Valeria is shot by a snake arrow and later dies in Conan\u2019s arms \u2013 she is cremated.</p><p>While waiting for the battle against Doom, Conan prays to Crom (his \u2018God\u2019). Subotai and Conan manage to defeat Doom\u2019s men, with the assistance of the Spirit of Valeria. Doom attempts to kill the Kings daughter but Subotai averted the snake arrow with his shield. Doom retreats into the distance.</p><p>That same night Conan, led by the Kings daughter, come forward from the shadows behind Doom and beheads him in front of a large following of his torch-bearing cult. The followers of Doom extinguish their torches in a fountain and leave. Conan then ignites the Mountain of Power by hurling a hanging lantern at it. Conan Carries the Princess off. At the end of the film, there is an Epilogue showing an older Conan on a thrown, narrated with the final lines \u2018This story shall also be told\u2019.</p></div></div>",

        "description":"<h2>Plot</h2><p>The film begins in 1953 with whom we later learn is The Centre explaining how it witnessed the evolution of the Earth and mankind. The explanation is shown being written and illustrated into a book titled \"<i>The Last Story</i>\" by a mysterious person who then proceeds to commit suicide. Then cutting to the Korean war where US Air Force pilot Hal Jordan and his partner Ace Morgan are attacked by North Korean fighters who are apparently uninformed of the cease fire just put into effect. Hal is shot down and parachutes down to a trench where a North Korean soldier is. He is attacked and is forced to kill the soldier by shooting him in the face. The event causes great trauma to Hal and he is placed in a mental hospital for the next two years.</p><p>It then cuts to Gotham Observatory where J'onn J'onzz is inadvertently teleported to Earth from Mars by a scientist. His arrival proved to be too much for the scientist and he died of a heart attack due to the shock of seeing a Martian. Being unable to return to Mars he adopts the guise of the scientist and goes out into Gotham City.</p><p>The following year, 1954 Superman goes to Indochina (Modern day Vietnam) to meet Wonder Woman who is celebrating with rebel women she freed. Superman is shocked to learn of Diana's and The Amazons moral and legal code, they allowed the women to exact their justice on their captors. Superman reminds her that the government already doesn't trust superheroes, which led to the disbanding of the Justice Society of America, the death of Hourman, and Batman being branded as fugitive vigilante who is now wanted by the government. Diana however states the she does what she feels is right and leaves for Paradise Island.</p><p>In Gotham, J'onn is living in an apartment under the guise of Dr. Erbel, mistaking a television for a source of information on Earth culture. While watching television he demonstrates his shape-shifting powers by becoming Bugs Bunny, Groucho Marx, and finally a detective like character. In Las Vegas Iris West is interviewing famous nightclub singer Buddy Blake at a casino where Hal Jordan and Ace Morgan also happen to be. Iris then goes to call her boyfriend, Barry Allen when Captain Cold breaks in. Hearing the events over the phone Barry uses his costume ring and becomes The Flash, racing from Central City to Las Vegas he confronts Cold who tells him there are six bombs hidden around the city. Zipping around the city Barry finds five of the bombs, zipping around the city a few more times looking for the sixth bomb he deduces that there is no sixth bomb. He then zips into the casino upstairs into a room and out the window, leaping into Cold's helicopter; knocking Cold down into a fountain along with himself. Before Barry could subdue cold he was possessed by an unknown creature who asks him why he is different from the \"lesser beings\".</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"460218\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/460218-j_onn_and_the_tv_super.jpg\" title='J&squot;onn \"learning from the TV.'><img id=\"460218\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/460218-j_onn_and_the_tv_thumb.jpg\" alt='J&squot;onn \"learning from the TV.' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">J&#39;onn \"learning from the TV.</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"460197\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/460197-flash_and_captain_cold_super.jpg\" title=\"Flash confronting Captain Cold\"><img id=\"460197\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/460197-flash_and_captain_cold_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Flash confronting Captain Cold\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Flash confronting Captain Cold</div></div></div></div><p>Hal and Ace leave the casino and head into the desert to Ferris Aircraft where Hal is going to be tested as a pilot.</p><p>Back in Gotham, J'onn is now with the Gotham City Police Department, under the guise of John Jones. John quickly rises to the rank of detective within two years, mostly due to him being able to solve crimes by using his powers. After investigating the kidnapping of a child which he later determined was part of a sacrificial cult, John and his partner Slam Bradley encounter Batman who is also investigating the kidnapping. They join Batman in fighting the cult members, a fire starts rendering J'onn useless because fire is Martians only weakness. His partner slam puts it out with a fire extinguisher, Batman then attempts to cut the boy loose from his bonds, terrifying the child. J'onn arrives and calms down the child, then he and his partner cut him down. The same creature that possessed Captain Cold takes possession of the cult leader, identifying itself for the first time as \"The Centre\" and warning of an impending judgment.</p><p>While at Ferris Industries Hal begins his training under Col. Rick Flag Sr., his joking daredevil like ways don't agree with Flag but Carol Ferris understands Hal and recognizes Hal's natural ability at flying planes. She also informs Flag that Hal should know the truth of his training and his mission. She takes him to an enormous underground hangar, to a conference room with the project's leader, Special Agent King Faraday. There he tells Jordan that several years earlier a scientist named Dr. Saul Erbel contacted Mars and accidentally transported a Martian to Earth. He then informs Hal that the mission is a flight to Mars to determine whether or not the Martians pose a threat to the Earth.</p><p>In Gotham, Batman reveals his knowledge of J'onn's true nature in his apartment, as he has found a way to shield his mind from J'onn's telepathy. Suggesting they should form an alliance since they're both investigating the ever growing cult that is spreading across the world. His act of kindness towards the boy leads him to think that he can be trusted. He warns him however that if he were to betray he is fully aware of and would use his weakness to fire against him if he felt he had to do so.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"458959\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/458959-batman_and_j_onn_super.jpg\" title=\"Batman in J'onn's apartment.\"><img id=\"458959\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/458959-batman_and_j_onn_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Batman in J'onn's apartment.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Batman in J'onn's apartment.</div></div></div></div><p>Meanwhile in Central City The Flash destroys a robotic copy of Gorilla Grodd but is then attacked by a group of government agents including Faraday and Mademoiselle Marie. They fire off tear gas and then throw a net over Barry but he phases through it and escapes.</p><p>At the Gotham city police station J'onn interrogates Harry Leiter, a former employee of Ferris Aircraft who was arrested for murder while under the influence of The Centre. During questioning, Harry slips and mentions the mars mission, then Agent Faraday arrives to take custody of Harry. J'onn greets him and when he shakes his hand he reads his thoughts and goes into his mind, uncovering the truth about the mars mission. He then goes to a local bar and on teh television he witnesses The Flash announce his retirements as a hero, he leaves and heads for the Batcave. He reveals to Batman that he's lost his faith in humanity and is planning to sneak on boar the space shuttle bound for mars. His response to J'onn's statement is cold and brief, telling him that not everyone has the luxury of leaving Earth.</p><p>He then goes to Ferris Aircraft and attempts to enter the ship but is seen on camera by Faraday. He confronts J'onn and attempts to shoot him but J'onn beats him and as the rocket was about to launch he grabbed Faraday and landed on a platform, then collapsing right before armed guards showed up. The rocket is damaged and malfunctions several minutes into flight. Hal wants to land the plane as he is skilled enough to do so but his co-pilot, Flag won't risk it as there are weapons on board. After a brief struggle with Flag, he ejects him and Flag then proceeds to initiate the self destruct sequence. When he is falling towards the Earth Superman comes to his rescue and safely brings him back to down to Earth to the launchpad. Superman then confronts Faraday for treating J'onn differently just because he doesn't look like everyone else. He also points out to Faraday that J'onn could have left any time he wanted to but he decided to stay and that should teach him something.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"266074\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/0/1423/266074-sup_spacel_super.jpg\" title=\"Superman to the rescue!\"><img id=\"266074\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/0/1423/266074-sup_spacel_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Superman to the rescue!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Superman to the rescue!</div></div></div></div><p>On Paradise Island wonder Woman is training with Mala, telling her of how much America has changed since the war over ten years earlier. She replies back saying that the island has changed, many Amazons no longer want Hippolyta in charge. The two of them stop training when they realize a huge creature, The Centre is approaching.</p><p>Back at Ferris Aircraft, while Hal is in a training simulator, it begins to shake and a green glow encircles it and it starts to fly. It takes him out into teh desert where he finds a crashed spaceship belonging to Abin Sur, the Green Lantern of Sector 2814. He tells him in his dying breath that he has been chosen to become the next Green Lantern of Sector 2814. He mentions that his ship was hit by massive amount of yellow energy, likely caused by Hal's ship exploding and that he was forced to crash land on Earth and send his ring out to find the next worthy man to become his replacement. He leaves his ring with Hal and warns him of the threat that The Centre poses to mankind before dying.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"460219\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/460219-hal_and_abin_sur_super.jpg\" title=\"Hal meeting Abin Sur.\"><img id=\"460219\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/460219-hal_and_abin_sur_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Hal meeting Abin Sur.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hal meeting Abin Sur.</div></div></div></div><p>In the Batcave, Superman and Batman review the evidence gathered by J'onn and Superman meets Robin for the first time. Superman asks him why the change in his costume and why the boy, he replies that he set out to strike terror in the hearts of the guilty not the innocent. As they talk they hear Lois come on over the radio, reporting the attack of a giant pterodactyl at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Superman flies to Cape Canaveral an quickly takes out the creature. Right after Wonder Woman's invisible plane makes a crash landing, its cockpit smothered in blood along with Diana. Before losing consciousness she warns Superman of The Centre's arrival.</p><p>Faraday and J'onn are now shown to be friends, occasionally chess with one another. J'onn reveals that he decided to stay because of the upcoming battle with The Centre and that he telepathically linked his with him on the platform before his capture. He found that Faraday believes that one day humanity won't live in a world with fear and hate. Being able to find that within Faraday renews J'onn's hope in humanity and decides to participate in the upcoming battle against The Centre to save the Earth. Before leaving with Faraday to Cape Canaveral J'onn adopts a new friendlier look and becomes a superhero calling himself the Martian Manhunter.</p><p>The Centre then begins its attack on the east coast of Florida, finally revealing itself for the first time. The Centre is massive island like creature with an army of mutated dinosaurs on it's surface. The threat draws the world's heroes including The Flash (Who was convinced by Iris to come out of retirement), <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/adam-strange/15-13003/\">Adam Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/green-arrow/15-1049/\">Green Arrow</a>, the Challengers of The Unknown, and The Blackhawk Squadron who clashed with the soldiers at the base. The clash was stopped by Superman who wants cooperation between both sides. Surprisingly Faraday agrees and seconds Superman's proposal along with J'onn, who feels that the government and heroes should work together for freedom. Superman then heads out to attack the Centre but is shockingly defeated in a second, leaving the other heroes and soldiers shocked.</p><p>The rest of the heroes and soldiers decide to band together, to fight the Centre in honor of Superman. Batman then interrupts a meeting between Faraday, J'onn, Will Magnus and the Challengers in order to present Ray Palmer, a scientist known for his work on matter reduction. One of the Challengers argue that it's a waste of time, the technology is too unreliable, causing everything it shrinks to become destabilized. Batman points out that that's the exact point, everything it shrinks becomes unstable, meaning his invention could be used against the Centre. Ace argues that no could get fast enough to go over the entire island with the machine, Batman points out that The Flash is fast enough. Their plan is to distract The Centre with an air attack on the outside and a small two man team comprised of Hal and Ace attacking inside while The Flash runs across The Centre.</p><p>Together Batman in the Batplane, Green Arrow in the Arrowplane, and Challengers of The Unknown lead the air assault but are soon outmatched until the Blackhawk Squadron intervenes, though Faraday and the ground forces are quickly outnumbered as well as they find themselves up against an army of mutated dinosaurs. J'onn is then overwhelmed by The Centre's immense telepathic abilities, Faraday then comes to his rescue but is captured by a dinosaur. As he is about be eaten Faraday grabs an entire belt of grenads, pulling off two and then pulling the pins before landing in the creature's mouth.</p><p>The shock of Faraday's death helps J'onn overcome The Centre's psychic attack and then he and Wonder Woman help turn the tides on the battle. Hal and Ace shoot their way into The Centre and once entering they find themselves in a bizarre psychedelic world, disorienting them at first. A thick red liquid then starts to secrete from the creature, jamming the controls of their planes. Right before his plane is about to explode Hal's ring activates, along with a message from The Guardians instructing him on the use of his ring.</p><p>As Ace is about to detonate his plane Hal rescues him, now dressed in a costume identical to the one worn by Abin Sur. The explosion gives the ground force enough time to send the Flash in. Racing across he reaches the Centre in a matter of seconds and leaps up onto it, circling around the entire thing before leaping off into th ocean. As The Centre begins to shrink it heads towards the coast, to take humanity with it.</p><p>Realizing the destruction that will cause Hal uses his ring on it, enveloping the creature with his energy and then hauling it into space to let it explode. As the entire world begins to celebrate Hal celebrates the achievement of his goal, finally being able to fly through space. Amidst the celebration comes Aquaman or Arthur of Atlantis as he is called along with Superman who he says has been calling for a woman named Lois for some time. The heroes gather together for a photo by Jimmy Olsen of the Daily Planet, making the front page.</p>",

Unknown to the city's inhabitants, a predator is in town.</p><p>Following a search and capture operation during a gang-war, <b>LAPD</b> cop <b>Harrigan</b>'s team senses something amiss. Someone seems to have gotten to their targets before them, and has literally butchered them. As more such incidents follow, Harrigan decides to visit the local \"powder prince\", <b>King Willie,</b> who is also an occult practitioner. Willie tells him that an unknown and powerful force is behind the murders of the policemen and the gang members. The predator then kills Willie.</p><p>Harrigan loses his best friend <b>Danny</b>, to the <b>predator</b>. After some hot talks with a special agent, Keyes, he loses another man of his team, when the predator attacks a metro-rail. The predator however releases LAPD cop <b>Cantrell</b>, when it realises that she is pregnant. Going to Danny's grave, he catches sight of Danny's necklace hanging from a tree. He knows that he is being followed by the killer.</p><p>One night, Harrigan sees the predator and follows it. After a lengthy chase, the predator stops at a slaughterhouse. But Harrigan is intercepted by <b>Keyes</b>' men and brought to their <b>mobile base</b>. Keyes tells him that they have been keeping tabs on the predator for some time, and have devised a way to capture it. The special agents dress up in special suits and go into the slaughterhouse. However, all their efforts fall in vain, when the predator switches its vision to a different wavelength and notices the men. Harrigan notices the predator's cautious movements and knows that the agents have lost their cover.</p><p>Soon after the predator kills all of the agents, Harrigan engages in a one-on-one fight with it and manages to wound it with his big guns. But the predator refuses to be put down, and kills Keyes who seemingly had survived the predator before. They make their way to the rooftop and Harrigan pushes both of them over the ledge. As the predator arms his nuclear bomb, Harrigan uses the predator's cutter disc to disarm the bomb and cut the predator's hand.</p><p>The action shifts to the next building and into the predators' spaceship. Inside a grand chamber, the predator engages Harrigan, but Harrigan still wins, using the predator's own weapon against it. The other predators come and take away their fallen comrade, and gift Harrigan with an antique flint-lock gun. Theh their spaceship blasts away, leaving Harrigan on the ground.</p><p>The special agents arrive too late, but Harrigan anticipates that the predators will return.</p>",

Demonic forces time warp him - and his '73 Oldsmobile - into England's Dark Ages, where he romances a beauty (Embeth Davidtz) and faces legions of undead beasts, including a fhastly army of skeletons. Can Ash save the living from the evil dead, rescue his girlfriend, and get back to his own time?&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Overflowing with spectacular specials effects, Army of Darkness will make you scream with fear and laughter. In the words of The Washington Post. it's \"drop-dead fun!\"",
