Garth, <a href=\"../../light-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ayla</a>, and their older brother <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekt</a> were joy riding when their ship lost power and came down on the world of <a href=\"/korbal/34-56256/\">Korbal</a>. They devised a scheme to recharge their ship's energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal's lightning beasts. They underestimated the beasts' power and were all bathed in bio-electric energy. After their return with new found powers, Mekt disappeared. Garth left home to look for his brother. On his journey he helped two other super powered teenagers foil the assassination of philanthropist <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>. Brande suggested they form a team - the <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Garth assumed the name Lightning Boy initially, but switched to Lightning Lad.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lightning Lad was created by <a href=\"../../otto-binder/26-42374/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Otto Binder</a> and <a href=\"../../al-plastino/26-39933/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Al Plastino</a></p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><span><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></span></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"489302\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489302-lightning_lad1_super.png\" title=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\"><img id=\"489302\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489302-lightning_lad1_thumb.png\" alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>He was one of the first Legionnaires to be killed when he sacrificed his life to save <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a>, taking a blast from <a href=\"/zaryan-the-conqueror/29-72707/\">Zaryan the Conqueror</a>'s ship. He was resurrected by <a href=\"../../proty/29-12861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proty</a>, the shape shifting pet of <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, who sacrificed his life to revive Garth in a lightning ceremony. Later, Garth lost his right arm to a giant space whale, and had to get a cybernetic replacement. Years later, his parents were killed in a space cruiser accident. His years on the Legion weren't all bad. He formed close friendships with <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a> and <a href=\"/sun-boy/29-1259/\">Sun Boy</a> and he and Saturn Girl became one of the Legion's earliest couples following his resurrection. His sister joined the Legion as well. Though Garth lost his arm, it was eventually restored. After several years of dating, Lightning Lad proposed to Saturn Girl and she accepted.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"81237\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81237-155819-lightning-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Live Wire (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"81237\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81237-155819-lightning-lad_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Live Wire (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Live Wire (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>In his search for his brother Mekt he had been branded a runaway due to only being 14, which was a minor on Winath. When his sister arrived to join the Legion as Winath's official representative, Garth quit in shame. He went on to work for the industrialist <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/29-12846/\">Leland McCauley</a> on his <a href=\"/workforce/65-47189/\">Workforce</a> team. Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/29-21136/\">President Chu</a>. She was impeached, and Brande was made president in her place. His first act as President was to eliminate the membership restrictions on the Legion, finally allowing Garth to rejoin.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"322174\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/322174-37608-lightning-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Lad (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"322174\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/322174-37608-lightning-lad_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Lad (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Garth Ranzz was Lightning Lad once more and one of the founders of the Legion of Super-Heroes. They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion's image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1093603\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar_super.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1093603\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later. Garth was once again married to Saturn Girl and a father to twin sons, though he ultimately rejoined the Legion when <a href=\"/earth-man/29-32576/\">Earth-Man</a> began an anti-alien campaign on Earth. The Legion founders went to the <a href=\"/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> to find proof that <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> was actually a Kryptonian and not an Earthling like Earth-Man was leading the people to believe, but Garth and the others were captured. Eventually he was freed and Earth-Man was defeated. After Saturn Girl's homeworld of Titan was destroyed and their twin boys were kidnapped but recovered from a servant of Darkseid, Garth and Imra decide to take a leave of absence from the Legion to spend time with their boys.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint: Earth-0</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2226596\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2226596-2148227-2148212-a_21.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Man (Earth-0)\"><img id=\"2226596\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2226596-2148227-2148212-a_21_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Man (Earth-0)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Man (Earth-0)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the conclusion of <a href=\"../../flashpoint/39-56280/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint</a>, the various timelines were united and rebooted once again. The Legion's timeline changed slightly where they still reached out to a young Clark Kent long before he became Superman, but they Legion grew up along with Clark and have changed their names to reflect their age. Imra changed her name to Saturn Woman and her along with Saturn Girl (Now Saturn Woman) and Cosmic Boy (Now Cosmic Man) reunited with an adult Clark Kent in an effort to stop the <a href=\"../../anti-superman-army/65-58873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Superman army</a> from destroying the original rocket that took Clark to Earth. They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact. During the battle, Garth's right arm was apparently destroyed off-panel. The wires seen in its place indicate that he had already replaced it with a cybernetic arm akin to the Earth-247 version.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Marry Life</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"489315\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489315-lightning_lad_saturn_girlgarthimra.jpg\" title=\"Garth x Imra\"><img id=\"489315\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489315-lightning_lad_saturn_girlgarthimra_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Garth x Imra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Garth x Imra</div></div></div></div><p>The duo were married and were forced to leave the Legion by its own by-laws, but this was shortly thereafter vetoed and the couple returned to active duty. Garth was even elected leader at one point, but the stress became too much and he resigned before the end of his term. Imra became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy, <a href=\"../../graym-ranzz/29-52820/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graym Ranzz</a>. Wanting to spend more time with his young family, Garth resigned with his fellow Legion founders from the team. Though it was a horror to learn that the villainous <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> was actually his son's twin, thrust through time and manipulated by <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a>, the boy was eventually restored and returned to the Ranzzes. Even after Saturn Girl returned to active duty, Garth remained at home with his sons.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1892563\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1892563-lil41_super.jpg\" title=\"Garth Ranzz (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1892563\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1892563-lil41_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Garth Ranzz (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Garth Ranzz (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the five years later after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Garth had relocated his family to Winath. There they established the Lightning Plantation and became a successful farming and shipping collective. Tragedy struck when Garth's son <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garridan</a>, the former Validus, began infecting Winathians with a deadly plague. His son had to be taken off-world to the planet Quarantine and could only visit wearing a special suit. The disease also caused Garth to walk with a limp. However, good news soon followed. Imra became pregnant again with twins and the Legion of Super-Heroes was reforming. Though the Ranzzes didn't join back up, they did assist their old teammates from time to time and Garth even gave them an old storage facility on <a href=\"../../talus/34-57116/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talus</a> to use as a headquarters.</p><h4>Who is Gath?</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2227711\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2227711-1480041-200px_proty.jpg\" title=\"The mind of Proty\"><img id=\"2227711\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2227711-1480041-200px_proty_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The mind of Proty\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The mind of Proty</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly after his daughters Dacey and Dorritt were born, his sister Ayla stumbled upon a secret that Garth had been keeping: he wasn't Garth at all, but Proty. Proty's consciousness had been transferred into Garth's body and was the cause of Lightning Lad's resurrection. Being a former telepath as Proty, Garth was able to protect his thoughts from his telepathic wife about the matter. Garth assisted Legionnaires past and present in hunting down <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> to save Cosmic Boy. <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> then happened and Garth and the other Legionnaires sacrificed themselves to save the timestream and create a new reality.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>The Death of Garth</h4><p>When half the Legion was stuck in the 20th century, Brande personally asked Garth to become Legion leader. Live Wire wasn't comfortable with the idea and shortly thereafter hosted a leadership election for a replacement. Once the team was reunited, he began a relationship with Saturn Girl and ultimately proposed. Garth and Imra were one of several Legionnaires lost in a spatial rift. Saturn Girl's manipulation of the team put a strain on their relationship. Live Wire sacrificed himself fighting their former teammate, <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>, who had spent billions of years becoming a mad god.</p><h4>Garth's Body Restored</h4><p>Garth's spirit, however, was stored in the living crystals of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>'s corpse, and he was able to return to the Legion - but in Element Lad's body. This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth's original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal. He then rejoined his team as they pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Electricity Control</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"506307\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/506307-sensor26.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Powers\"><img id=\"506307\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/506307-sensor26_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Powers</div></div></div></div><p>Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity and direct bolts of electricity accurately. Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"196791\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196791-77896-lightning-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Live Wire (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"196791\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196791-77896-lightning-lad_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Live Wire (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Live Wire (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Months beforehand, young counterparts from the Legion's early days surfaced among <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominator</a> experiments on Earth.

His team went on to become the Legionnaires of New Earth and Garth took on the name Live Wire.

He had an origin similar to the comic books, though this time his sister Ayla didn't survive the attack by the lightning beasts as children. This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him. In season two, Garth lost his arm to his brother and <a href=\"/imperiex/29-10006/\">Imperiex</a> and was given a cybernetic one.

Naltor's native denizens are genetically inclined to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age, Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future while awake, than any other. Nura's exceptional beauty often hid the fact that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy's intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> on a mission in space. Determined to prevent their deaths, she introduced herself to the Legion using the code name of Dream Girl.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dream Girl was created in 1964 by writer <a href=\"/edmond-hamilton/26-42401/\">Edmond Hamilton</a> and artist <a href=\"/john-forte/26-7532/\">John Forte</a>, first appearing in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/49-3105/\">Adventure Comics</a> #310. She became the sixth female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall. As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"../../marilyn-monroe/29-16582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe</a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on her right cheek. Despite her looks, Dream Girl was also conceived to be one of the Legion's most intelligent and capable members.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"495653\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/495653-dreamgirlguice_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Pre-Crisis)\"><img id=\"495653\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/495653-dreamgirlguice_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Pre-Crisis)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Pre-Crisis)</div></div></div></div><p>Nura knew from her vision that several of the Legionnaires would face death in an explosion in space if they remained members of the team. At oen of the Legion's open try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"/starman/29-1260/\">Star Boy</a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Lightning Lass</a>, who had her electrical powers seemingly removed by Nura's Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning Lass' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of gravity.</p><p>Once the truth of Dream Girl's scheme came out, the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> so she would have time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance. Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> and <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superboy</a> were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team.</p><p>With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion's sexy-costume era of the 70's), and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team, and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her natural charm and charisma.</p><p>Dream Girl became leader of the Legion during the <a href=\"/great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\">Great Darkness Saga</a>, performing admirably and unexpectedly well, due to her amazing intelligence and charisma. At one point, Dream Girl cheated on Star Boy. He left the team in response to become planetary champion of his home planet, <a href=\"/xanthu/34-56504/\">Xanthu</a>. Dream Girl then began a relationship with <a href=\"/atmos/29-28222/\">Atmos</a>, Xanthu's former champion. Realizing Atmos may have been mentally manipulating her, she knocked him out cold with one punch and went back home to the Legion.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"268337\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/268337-4124-dream-girl_super.jpg\" title=\"Dreamer (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"268337\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/268337-4124-dream-girl_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dreamer (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dreamer (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour</i> Legion stories. For most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still Star Boy's girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy, falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of <a href=\"/black-witch/29-30998/\">Mysa</a>, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained Legion membership under the codename Dreamer.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1327693\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1327693-dreamgirl_stasis_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"1327693\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1327693-dreamgirl_stasis_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Dream Girl stopped an assassination attempt on the United Planets delegates by a spy. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> had compiled data for three days and sent Dream Girl, <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid</a>, and <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a> to stop the assassin. The Legionnaires looked like they were beaten, until Karate Kid woke Dream Girl from a daydream and she took down the assassin down with ease, saying that she thought they had already defeated him. Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl's precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later, Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"../../shadow-lass/29-1261/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Lass</a> and Brainiac 5 were all sent to Dream Girl's home planet of Naltor to investigate why no one under the age of 18 was able to sleep.</p><p>Brainiac 5 eventually realized that he was in love with her, right before she was killed in the battle that destroyed most of the Legion Headquarters. He stopped her soul from escaping, and she went to live only in Brainiac's mind while he tried to figure out a way to restore her body.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1574192\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3347/1574192-lsheroes_cv11_02_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1574192\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3347/1574192-lsheroes_cv11_02_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>Dream Girl's story pick up before the Five Years Later, the Legion mysteriously returned in the 21st Century, including the original Dream Girl. Members of the team were scattered and trapped in different places throughout the universe. Dream Girl herself had been captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain <a href=\"../../doctor-destiny/29-10453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny</a> in <a href=\"../../arkham-asylum/34-31682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum</a>, where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions. She was rescued by the <a href=\"../../justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society</a> and <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League</a>, and was reunited with her longtime love Thom Kallor (formerly Star Boy), who had been flung back in time to become the new <a href=\"../../starman/29-7646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman</a>. In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic, since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time unprepared.</p><p>She felt terribly for him and believed that the 21st-century methods of treating his mental illness were barbaric. Dream Girl has since established a connection to the realm of '<a href=\"/the-dreaming/34-55857/\">The Dreaming</a>,' further enhancing her precognitive powers. She also correctly predicted the threat of <a href=\"../../superman-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> in <a href=\"../../final-crisis/39-51642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Crisis</a>: <a href=\"../../final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/49-22674/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Three Worlds</a>, the recent storyline which united all three versions of the Legion together. After the <a href=\"/last-stand-of-new-krypton/39-56041/\">war</a> with <a href=\"/new-krypton/34-56084/\">New Krypton</a> in the 21st century, Dream Girl was able to bring Star Boy back home to the 31st century to get him the medical treatment he needed.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>Dream Girl x Star Boy</h4><p>Though Nura continued to receive constant attention from the unattached male Legionnaires (and even some of the attached ones), <a href=\"../../star-boy/29-1260/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star Boy</a> (Thom Kallor) was the one who eventually managed to capture her heart. Nura became very close to him and she was romantically involved with Star Boy for many years. Dream Girl spent several years as someone who needed to be rescued, partly due to her effective but non-combative power. Not wanting to be a liability she trained intensively in hand-to-hand combat in order to better serve the team on the field. She was a quick study and became a highly skilled martial artist, second on the team in unarmed combat to only <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid.</a> Her precognitive power to foresee an opponent's moves before they even made them further enhanced her effectiveness as a fighter.</p><h4>Dream Girl Leaves The Legion</h4><p>At one point Nura took a temporary leave from the team, since she believed she had initially joined under false pretenses. She had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires while dreaming and proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion in order to save their lives. During this time she joined the <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> until she reunited with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for accidentally killing Nura's former lover, a Naltorian named Kenz Nahor, in self-defense after Nahor attempted to kill Star Boy out of jealousy.</p><h4>Dream Girl vs. Universo</h4><p>She is also one of the few Legion members who have demonstrated sufficient willpower to utilize her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving her the ability of telekinesis. She is also one of four Legionnaires that <a href=\"/universo/29-22717/\">Universo</a> thought were there the most dangerous to his attempt to control the Earth (along with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four assumed that they were isolated as the most dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have been that those four had the most resistance to Universo's mind control - even more than the Legion's (then current) telepath, <a href=\"/tellus/29-30996/\">Tellus</a>.</p><h4>Dream Girl Elected as Leader</h4><p>Dream Girl soon rejoined the Legion and continued serving as a highly valued member. After <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad</a>'s term as Legion leader went horribly awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially scoffed at the idea of the Legion's glamour girl winning the job, until they realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>).</p><h4>Dream Girl x Atmos</h4><p>Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"../../great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga</a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a> appeared in the 30th century and attempted to conquer the whole of the United Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl's able leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle. During this time Nura's sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling herself the <a href=\"../../white-witch/29-30998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Witch</a>. Though she ran for leader again the next year, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship suffered. She started flirting more in the public eye. This made Thom upset at this and he decided to return to his home planet, Xanthu. She had a brief romance with <a href=\"../../atmos/29-28222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atmos</a> of Xanthu and broke up with Thom, then the truth becomes apparent to her that Atmos somehow taking over her emotions and sapping her will. She slowly building up a tolerance to Atmos mind-sapping powers. Then one night when Atmos had falls asleep, she regains herself enough to click her flight-ring alarm and she ran back to Thorm.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1888499\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888499-dg30_super.jpg\" title=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1888499\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888499-dg30_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">High Seer (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>During the five years after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a> she left the Legion, when the collapse of the galactic economy and Earthgov's hostility toward the Legion made her return to Naltor to be its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through the troubled times, and its is now, under her leadership, one of the most stable economies in the United Planets. Alone and missing Star Boy, Dream Girl turned to several men during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate some sort of time-flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and just before the destruction of the time line, shared a kiss with Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> event.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>Dream Girl Leads Her Team</h4><p>On Naltro, the Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction, her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army. When she woke up she said one word... 'Brainy'. Dream Girl lead the team to the public service broadcaster ,where they found Brainy \"attacking the problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security and comfort. She chose the former.</p><h4>Dream Girl x Brainiac 5?</h4><p>When the team returned to Legion headquarters, Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were married.</p><h4>The Death of Dream Girl</h4><p>After this the Legion's true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a href=\"../../terra-firma/65-47457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma</a>, lead by the super-powered <a href=\"../../elysion/29-1274/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion</a> and <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a>. Terra Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem. Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos, the answer to Dream Girl's problem was answered... she could not see past her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.</p><h4>The Return of Dream Girl</h4><p>After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed Dream Girl's body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful: Nura's consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to get married.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>The New 52</h4><p>The effort of DC to revitalize its titles led to the new 52 in which all the titles were relaunched simultaneously. Legion of Super Heroes was not as changed as other titles but it remains to be the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> still appear to have a strong relationship, though to what degree has not been indicated.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Precognition</h3><p>Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions. This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, though Nura's ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see a few seconds into the future at any given moment.</p><p><b>Unarmed Combat</b></p><p>Dream Girls spent the early period of her portrayal as a character that often needed to be rescued. She resolved to change that and spent long hours with the Legion's ultimate martial arts master, Karate Kid, who has given Dream Girl extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. She was one of his most gifted students, to the point where she is the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows her to predict her opponent's moves even before they make them and map out a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician, and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than her, such as the <a>Persuader</a>.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few legionairres to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual prowess. She was also given special treatment by the villian Universo, as one of the four biggest threats to his domination of Earth (along with <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a>, <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, and Brainiac 5).</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. Dream Girl has used the ring in various ways unknown to other Legionnaires. Using her strong willpower, Nura can use the flight ring to levitate and move other objects nearby, as if she has telekinesis.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1888505\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888505-dg31_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"1888505\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888505-dg31_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>The devastation of the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/39-56080/\">Magic Wars</a> caused original Legion continuity to jump ahead five years in what is now known as the Five Year Gap.

They were later revealed to be time-paradox duplicates of the original Legion, rather than clones. They operated separately from the original Legion and formed their own team, the <a href=\"/legionnaires/65-56923/\">Legionnaires</a>, and starred in their own series with that title. All of the Legionnaires except for Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl, <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Live Wire</a> and Invisible Kid seemed to think that Dream Girl was part of the team the entire time...but she wasn't and her existence, which remained stable until she joined with her adult counterpart and disappeared at the end of the universe, was a blip in time caused by Zero Hour.</p><h3>Superboy's Legion</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2415132\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2415132-dreamgirl_superboys_legion.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Superboy's Legion)\"><img id=\"2415132\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2415132-dreamgirl_superboys_legion_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Superboy's Legion)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Superboy's Legion)</div></div></div></div><p>Dream Girl appeared as a member of the Legion in <a href=\"/superboys-legion/49-21245/\">Superboy's Legion</a>, an <a href=\"/elseworlds/12-46699/\">Elseworlds</a> story.

After centuries of disuse, the title \"Brainiac\" was taken by Querl's father, and eventually was given to Querl at the age of twelve. He was the fifth to ever hold the title. Making many breakthroughs in the science of time travel during university as a young boy thanks to his mentor <a href=\"../../circadia-senius/29-48002/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Circadia Senius</a>, Querl was invited to join the Time Institute in <a href=\"../../metropolis/34-41184/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metropolis</a> on Earth. He became close friends with fellow time genius, <a href=\"../../rond-vidar/29-12860/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rond Vidar</a>. He invented the <a href=\"../../time-bubble/18-47355/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Bubble</a>, which became the primary mode of time travel for the Legion of Super-Heroes. While using a Time Viewer to see the dawn of time, the <a href=\"../../green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern Corps</a> attacked him, but he was saved by the newly formed Legion of Super-Heroes. Impressed by the team, and using his code-name of Brainiac 5, he tried out and joined the Legion alongside <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>. He went on to collaborate with the first <a href=\"../../invisible-kid/29-1256/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invisible Kid</a>, Lyle Norg, to invent the <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Rings</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Brainiac 5 was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/26-40754/\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/jim-mooney/26-15983/\">Jim Mooney</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"596021\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30247/596021-jla2005_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\"><img id=\"596021\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30247/596021-jla2005_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>Brainiac 5 is usually portrayed as being anti-social, cold towards others, aloof and self-involved. The reasoning for this is his heightened intelligence which always surpasses those around him, making it difficult for him to relate communication his point to others. Through sensible, appropriate dialogue, Brainiac 5 found he had to \"dumb down\" his conversations so his peers could understand his ramblings. Still Brainiac 5 has shown a dedicated valor to his friends and the <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion</a>, he has enjoyed being the resident brainchild on the team. Brainiac 5's career has had its ups and downs. He invented the robot, <a href=\"../../computo/29-47321/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Computo</a>, which rebelled and caused trouble for the Legion, including cause the death of one of <a href=\"../../triplicate-girl/29-1262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triplicate Girl's</a> bodies.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"673480\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/673480-brainiac51_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 / 5.1 (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"673480\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/673480-brainiac51_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 / 5.1 (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 / 5.1 (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>The Querl Dox of Earth-247 was awarded the title of Brainiac. Before Querl, his <a href=\"../../brainiac-4/29-69693/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mother</a>, a famous scientist for Colu, held the title. She abandoned Querl on his day of birth and he inherited her research. He was speaking by the time he was an infant and functionally working as a scientist by a toddler. Querl's research conflicted with Colu's and he was sent to do research for <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>. Querl destroyed several of Brande's labs, and when Brande could no longer afford to keep him on staff, Brande sent him to work at the Time Institute on Talus. While there, he met Rond Vidar. Querl received a draft notice from Colu to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. He was so wrapped up in his work, that he ignored it. Once he was noticed as missing, he was brought into the Legion.</p><p>Joining the Legion as Brainiac 5, he was instrumental in many cases. He saved the Earth from the White Triangle, healed Triad, cured Andromeda's lead poisoning, and created the anti-gravity metal that was used in the Legion Flight Rings. He developed a crush on Andromeda, but after she was seemingly killed, he threw himself into his work. He made some new discoveries, and used them to travel back in time to save the hero, <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valor</a>. He was arrested by the United Planets, however, because time travel was illegal. He was pardoned when R.J. Brande became President and legalized time travel. Brainy and a group of Legionnaires were exiled to the 20th Century by the <a href=\"../../emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerald Eye</a>. With his technological sources limited, the Legionnaires were trapped for several months.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"959816\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/959816-brainiac_44_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"959816\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/959816-brainiac_44_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Brainiac 5 is an influential figure with leadership designs that include usurping leadership of the United Planets. Early on Brainiac 5 comes into conflict with Legion leader <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> about the way he has been leading the team. Brainiac 5 is visited by <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a> and is the only Legionnaire to later recall his face. Brainiac 5 broadcasts a conversation between Cosmic Boy and <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Boy</a>, causing a fight between the Legionnaires on his side and Cosmic Boy's supporters. Cosmic Boy is called back to his home planet and Brainiac 5 assumes leadership of the Legion. They reconciled later and moved forward as allies. <a href=\"../../dream-girl/29-1254/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dream Girl</a> was killed during a Terra Firma attack and Brainiac 5 recovered her body and became obsessed with finding a way to resurrect her. He captured Lemnos to try and revive her, but the experiment destroyed her physical body. It did however leave her consciousness alive in Brainiac 5's dreams.</p><p>Later, Brainy's intellect turned the tide in the battle with the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>. Brainy constructed a \"bomb\" , which was really a <a href=\"../../phantom-zone-projector/18-42369/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phantom Zone projector</a>, which <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-el</a> flew into the core of the Dominion Homeworld. He also created an anti-lead serum for Mon-El. Brainiac 5 invented a Chronexus that could view the past, and even open temporary time travel portals. With the help of <a href=\"../../evolvo-lad/29-12854/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolvo Lad</a>, he used the Chronexus to send <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a> back to the 21st Century. After Cosmic Boy's disappearance, he manipulated events that resulted in the arrest of <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekt Ranzz</a>, boosting <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf's</a> powers, and the recruitment of possible Legionnaire <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.R.G. 1</a>. Still, his ultimate goal was to bring Dream Girl back to life. Brainiac 5 spent more and more time sleeping to be with her. After a time, he proposed in the dream realm. After inventing a machine that could upload the Legionnaires' minds into an information-based reality and being forced to recreate their bodies, he created a body for Dream Girl as well, downloading her consciousness from his mind into the new body. He then invited the Legion to attend their wedding.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"541904\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\"><img id=\"541904\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>The event known as <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities. Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes has returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team prior to the Five Year Later. Due to the removal of the original Supergirl and the <a href=\"../../retcon/12-43566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">retcon</a> addition of the latest Kara Zor-El, Brainiac 5's past was changed. He joined the Legion as before, but without Supergirl accompanying him. Brainiac 5 would later meet the current Kara Zor-El when she was stranded weeks later in the future. He was against the idea of letting her stay. She spent an extended period of time with the team, most notably when Satan Girl attacked Earth. The two teamed up to defeat her, sparking a young romance, before Kara returned home. During this period, Brainiac 5 intentionally rigged the founding Legionnaires' time bubble to visit Superboy rather than Superman. This resulted in Superboy's historic joining of the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><p>Rejoining the Legion after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Brainy used his knowledge to help protect the galaxy once more by organizing several secret missions among the Legionnaires to help protect time. He sent a team back to the 21st Century with lightning rods to retrieve the essence of <a>Bart Allen</a> after his death as a secret weapon for the future. He also had arranged for <a>Starman</a>, Thom Kallor, to place <a>Superboy's</a> (Kon-El) body in the Kryptonian chrysalis in the 21st Century to be resurrected in the 31st.</p><p>Later, <a>Earth Man</a> caused a wave of xenophobia to spread on Earth. Brainy sent a Time Bubble to retrieve Superman for assistance. Deported due to his heritage, Brainy took over leadership of Colu to deter the <a>United Planets</a> from going to war with Earth. Superman finally arrived in the 31st Century months later, and helped defeat Earth Man's Justice League. When <a>Superboy-Prime</a> and the <a>Legion of Super-Villains</a> went on a rampage, Brainiac Five was used his previous contingencies of Superboy and Kid Flash to help turn the tide. He also recruited the Legion of Earth-247 and Earth-Prime to help. The Legionnaires eventually defeated the villains, though Earth-Man was forced by the government to join the Legion. Brainy made a special flight ring to keep Earth-Man under control but eventually awarded him a standard one. Presently, Brainiac 5 is investigating the mysterious <a href=\"../../harmonia-li/29-71175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harmonia Li</a>, a self proclaimed student of time travel and immortal.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>A insane Brainiac 5</h4><p>The computer tyrants of Colu, in the humanoid form known as <a href=\"../../pulsar-stargrave/29-52496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pulsar Stargrave</a>, claimed to be his real father, and caused Brainy to go mad for a time. Stargrave used Brainy to frame <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a> for the murder of An Ryd, but this was cleared up when <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon Boy</a> discovered that Stargrave was the true culprit. Still mad, Brainiac 5 accidentally created the vastly powerful <a href=\"../../infinite-man/29-51353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Man</a>. Then he used the <a href=\"../../miracle-machine/18-56136/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miracle Machine</a> to create the unstoppable Omega, which destroyed <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes-headquarters/34-55774/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Headquarters</a>.</p><p><a href=\"../../matter-eater-lad/29-3598/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matter-Eater Lad</a> saved the day, but it drove him crazy as well. Both Legionnaires were admitted into psychiatric care. Brainiac 5 was temporarily released to help the <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> defeat the <a href=\"../../league-of-super-assassins/65-47504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">League of Super-Assassins</a>. With the aid of <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>, she was able to purge Brainy's mind of the madness. He later went on to cure Matter-Eater Lad, as well as <a href=\"../../computo/29-27114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danielle Foccart</a>, the sister of the second <a href=\"../../jacques-foccart/29-26646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invisible Kid</a>. After many years of Legion service, Brainy was forced to resign due to insubordination for his conspiracy within the Legion to kill the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a>.</p><h4>Five years later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"323259\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323259-41456-brainiac-5_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"323259\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323259-41456-brainiac-5_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>After the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Brainiac 5 was still a top scientist assisting the United Planets. When <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> defeated the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> and took his place in history, one of the biggest side-effects was that Supergirl was erased from the Legion's history and replaced with <a href=\"../../andromeda/29-6965/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laurel Gand</a>. Laurel stayed on with the Legion continuously, unlike Supergirl, and she and Brainy enjoyed a lengthy and healthy romance when they were young. However, he began to neglect her because he could not justify ignoring his responsibilities for romantic pursuits. In this new history, after the conspiracy to defeat <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and his subsequent expulsion from the Legion, he left Earth for Colu without consulting Laurel and their relationship ended.</p><h4>Zero Hour</h4><p>Brainiac 5 traveled to Winath to help try to find a cure for the <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> plague. He then rejoined the Legion when they reformed after facing <a href=\"../../roxxas/29-21133/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roxxas</a> the Butcher. Although both he and Laurel had rejoined, he felt uncomfortable around her, because she had found love with Brainy's best friend, Rond Vidar. An incident with Glorith left Brainiac 5's body aged, causing him to have to wear a special suit to allow mobility. He later went into hiding with the team when they were framed for aiding the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khunds</a>. Brainiac 5 was wiped out of existence by the time fluctuations of <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, along with an SW6 'time clone' who had surfaced months prior among the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/49-4971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a>.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Brainiac 5 becomes Brainiac 5.1</h4><p>After returning to the 30th Century, Brainy and others helped Andromeda investigate an anomaly in space. Once out of the anomaly, Brainy found himself changed. His personality was more friendly and there were grafts on his face that controlled his force field. <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates</a> jokingly renamed him Brainiac 5.1, a name that stuck for a short time. After an attack on Earth by the Blight, Brainy was one of ten Legionnaires who were lost in a rift in space. After a year in the \"Second Galaxy\", Brainy was able to use <a href=\"../../shikari/29-5941/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shikari's</a> pathfinding abilities to lead them home. Once home, they were soon threatened by Robotica, a collective of artificial intelligence. Brainiac 5 learned that this collective was engineered by Computo, whom he had created while in the 20th century. Computo had survived through the ages and considered itself to be Brainy's progeny. Later, Brainiac 5 and the other Legionnaires barely survived the destruction of Earth-247 during the <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>. They were brought to New Earth by that Earth's Brainiac 5. After the Legions of Three Worlds defeated Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainy and the other Legionnaires from Earth-247 chose to explore the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the \"New Wanderers\".</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intellect</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1711621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63607/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super_super.jpg\" title=\"12th Level Intelligence\"><img id=\"1711621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63607/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"12th Level Intelligence\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">12th Level Intelligence</div></div></div></div><p>While the population of 20th century Earth has a 6th level intelligence, and average <a href=\"../../coluans/65-55891/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coluans</a> have a 10th level intelligence, Brainiac 5 has a 12th level intelligence. Hence, Brainiac 5 is known as the smartest person in the universe.</p><p>He is able to create very advanced technology such as time machines (such as the Time Cube, Time Spheres and Chronexus), Flight Rings, artificial intelligences, and Force Shields. Brainy is also knowledgeable with medical technology as well, having invented the anti-lead serum for Mon-El and curing Matter-Eater Lad of his madness. Each level of intelligence represents a separate thought track, allowing him to think about or solve twelve equations simultaneously. His brain processes formulas at the speed of a computer.</p><p>While physical combat is not something he excels at, he has been known to use his body physics in combat to defend himself or incapacitate opponents. His advanced intellect presents a challenge when people try to affect him with mental abilities - he just thinks faster than they do. He has been known to learn new languages in just hours of listening to conversation.While it is not often illustrated, he excels at using technology in all forms (he is one of the Legion's best pilots), or finding weak spots in other people technology. With his powerful mind he can regulate his body's automatic nervous features with ease.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Brainiac 5 has several other equipment items at his disposal. Brainiac's personal force field belt is nearly impenetrable when it is active. One version of his force field belt is used by <a href=\"../../booster-gold/29-1786/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Booster Gold</a>. In some iterations, like the Brainiac 5 of Earth-247, this force field is actually internalized. As a Legionnaire, he is equipped with a Legion flight ring which allows him to fly. It can also be used as a long-range communication and tracking device.</p><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Brainiac 5 possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.

Brainy and Kara were instrumental in defeating the Fatal Five and saving the day.

He brings Superman back onto the team and ultimately reveals to Kal-el his connection to the villainous Brainiac, causing a rift between the two friends. Determined to not become like his ancestor, Brainy accessed a part of his programming that was from the original Brainiac in order to increase his own knowledge. This backfired as it allowed Brainiac to slowly corrupt Brainiac 5, ultimately turning him into his host for his return. The entire Legion assembled and it was Superman who helped free Brainiac 5 from his ancestor's control. The resulting purge of Brainiac's programming converted Brainiac 5 into a human being for the first time.

He created a serum that allowed him to turn invisible, and earned a place in the Legion of Super-Heroes as one of its earliest members shortly after <a href=\"/colossal-boy/29-1271/\">Colossal Boy</a> and <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>. A dedicated member, Lyle often engaged in regular exercise and combat training to make his contributions to the Legion greater. Though he often served covertly in the background, Lyle's peers recognized his accomplishments and he was eventually elected the Legion's fourth leader in the team's fifth term.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lyle Norg was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/26-40754/\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/jim-mooney/26-15983/\">Jim Mooney</a> . Lyle was the first election where the readers were able to vote for Legion leader and Lyle's success is largely attributed to the readership wanting to see him get more to do. Earth-247 Lyle was later revealed as gay, though this was only hinted at during his publication.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"323270\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323270-120831-invisible-kid_super.jpg\" title=\"Invisible Kid (Pre-Crisis)\"><img id=\"323270\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323270-120831-invisible-kid_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (Pre-Crisis)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (Pre-Crisis)</div></div></div></div><p>Lyle was instrumental in helping the Legion win back Earth from its possession by <a href=\"/universo/29-22717/\">Universo</a>. Following his stint as leader, Lyle began to aid Legion cadet <a href=\"/chemical-king/29-21509/\">Chemical King</a> in the use of his powers and the two became fast friends. After several years of service, Lyle began to be haunted by a ephemeral girl named Myla. Despite her intangibility, the two got along well and Lyle became romantically interested in her.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"182516\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7368/182516-160591-invisible-kid_super.JPG\" title=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"182516\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7368/182516-160591-invisible-kid_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>The rebooted Lyle Norg was born on Earth-247 to scientist parents who often spent long periods of time away from home. As a result, young Lyle was predominantly raised by the Foccart family. A child prodigy, Lyle became interested in chemistry at an early age thanks to the Foccarts. Initially, he only created and patented things like new flavors of ice cream, but soon became more complex with his creations. His greatest invention was a serum that bent light around his body and clothing, rendering him invisible at will. EarthGov became interested in Lyle's discovery and enlisted him to do some investigative work for them. He was joined by the powerless Jacques Foccart, whom Lyle considered a brother, and the young woman who would one day become the villainous <a href=\"/charma/29-52495/\">Charma</a>. Lyle's knowledge of the Durlan language and close friendship with <a>Chameleon</a> suggests that he spent time on Durla during these days. On his last mission, Lyle was tricked into stealing his own formula. Jacques consumed it, but unlike Lyle he appeared to simply fade from existence. Disgusted, Lyle quit EarthGov and was instead drafted by Earth into the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"608517\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/608517-invisiblekid1_super.jpg\" title=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"608517\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/608517-invisiblekid1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Lyle was a child prodigy in this reality who was asked by his father and the government to create an invisibility serum. Upon learning that his father had planned to give it away for military use, Lyle decided to inject himself with the only sample so that it could never fall upon abusive hands. He lied about injecting himself, claiming instead the serum never worked. Lyle then contacted his colleague, Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes, for help in escaping from his parents who had registered him on public service. Lyle and Brainy had previously collaborated on the Legion flight rings. Brainy sponsored Lyle for Legion membership and he was accepted as Invisible Kid. At odds with his parents for running away, especially his military father, Lyle would later reconcile with the Norgs.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2156373\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/65157/2156373-lylenorg.jpg\" title=\"Invisible Kid (New Earth)\"><img id=\"2156373\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/65157/2156373-lylenorg_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>The events of <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities.

Myla then appeared to the Legion, revealing herself a ghost and promising to take care of Lyle in the afterlife. He was mourned by the Legion, especially Chemical King and <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a>.

He even aided Cham in giving secret admirer gifts to <a href=\"../../lightning-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spark</a>, who mistook them as being from Invisible Kid. When half the Legion was trapped in the 20th century, Lyle remained in the 30th and was elected leader by the membership. Though he didn't want the job, Lyle proved adept at handling it. Months later, when the Legion was reunited, Lyle stepped down from leadership for private reasons and gave the job to <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>. Lyle was later captured by his old teammate Charma, seeking revenge on him.

He developed feelings for time-lost member <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>, who didn't reciprocate and ultimately left the team. On a mission to Triton, Lyle developed feelings for a local girl named <a href=\"../../gazelle/29-50438/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giselle</a> who had been ridiculed by her people, but was afraid to show himself to her. To investigate matters that didn't fall under the Legion's proper jurisdiction, Lyle formed the top-secret Legion Espionage Squad and served as its leader. Eventually, Giselle joined the Legion as Gazelle. Lyle, still hiding from his crush, used virtual reality to make himself appear older and buffer than he truly was. Gazelle was fond of this form, but when Lyle's ruse was uncovered she didn't seem to mind the real Lyle either.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Invisibility</h3><p>Invisible Kid developed and consumed a serum that allowed him to turn any or all parts of his body invisible at will.

While its people are able to pass through walls and other solid objects at will, she was the only member of her race with the ability to pass fully through the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a> and onto Earth, which shared dimensional space with Bgztl. After the death of her father and disagreements with her mother, Tinya was looking for an escape and found it on a newscast of the newly formed <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Tinya left her mother <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/29-12817/\">Winema</a> and brother <a href=\"/gyma-wazzo/29-61459/\">Gyma</a> behind and smuggled herself onto Earth with all of her savings. After doing so, Tinya impressed the Legion by showing them how easily their defenses could be breached by a phantom and imploring them to induct her. She was promptly made a member and given the codename <b>Phantom Girl</b>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Phantom Girl was created in 1961 by writer <a href=\"../../jerry-siegel/26-40754/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jerry Siegel</a> (the co-creator of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>) and artist <a href=\"../../jim-mooney/26-15983/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Mooney</a>. She was the second character to be recruited by the Legion of Super-Heroes following its three founding members, making her the third female member of the Legion and its fifth overall.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"795209\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795209-phantomgirl_70s_laroque.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl: Classic 70's costume\"><img id=\"795209\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795209-phantomgirl_70s_laroque_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl: Classic 70's costume\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl: Classic 70's costume</div></div></div></div><p>Tinya was sworn in alongside Luornu Durgo (<a href=\"../../duplicate-girl/29-1262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triplicate Girl</a>) and the two became friends as well as the Legion's first recruits following the three founding members. As a Legionnaire, Tinya's unique phasing abilities made her a crucial contact between Earth and the Phantom Zone. Tinya and Jo Nah (<a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>) became one of the earliest Legion couples. Tinya was so taken with Jo that she was willing to aid him even when it was thought he had betrayed the Legion. The two have since formed of the Legion's most enduring couples. Phantom Girl became a founding member of the Legion Espionage Squad and became best friends with Tasmia Mallor (<a href=\"/shadow-lass/29-1261/\">Shadow Lass</a>), and Tinya and Jo would often double-date with Tasmia and her boyfriend <a href=\"/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-el</a>. After an incident when Ultra Boy was thought dead, Tinya mourned greatly. She was later ecstatic to discover he was alive but had simply had amnesia. Tinya became the most senior Legionnaire and has served in the Legion longer than anyone else. As a founder of the Legion Espionage Squad, Tinya displayed remarkable leadership abilities (despite the odd fact that she has never actually been elected Legion leader).</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"795206\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" title=\"Apparition: Earth-247\"><img id=\"795206\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Apparition: Earth-247\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Apparition: Earth-247</div></div></div></div><p>After the event called <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, Legion history was completely rebooted, with this reality later designated as <b>Earth-247</b>. Tinya was again one of the earliest Legion recruits, though in this continuity she took the code name <b>Apparition</b> rather than Phantom Girl. Bgztl was now an actual planet in the United Planets, rather than a dimensional neighbor, and Tinya's mother, <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/29-12817/\">Winema</a>, served as Bgztl's ambassador. Tinya lived with her mother on Earth with no family, having been born to her mother and a drifter. Tinya and Winema were both unaware her father was a Carggite and that Tinya was as well. When she was born and Winema was asleep, he stole two of the three Tinya bodies and sold them off to the Luck Lords. Ignorant of this, Tinya was raised with all the spoils of Winema's career. Apparition joined the Legion after she helped foil an assassination plot at a UP conference, the first recruit alongside Triad. While a Legionnaire, she often argued with her mother. This was especially so when Tinya started to fall in love with the unbecoming Ultra Boy of the <a href=\"/workforce/65-47189/\">Workforce</a>. The two dated in secret and professed their love to each other just as a Daxamite terrorist fried them with heat vision, killing Tinya. She was buried on Earth and mourned by the Legion, Ultra Boy, and her mother.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"539679\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/539679-phantom__girl.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl: Earth-Prime\"><img id=\"539679\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/539679-phantom__girl_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl: Earth-Prime\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl: Earth-Prime</div></div></div></div><p>Legion history was rebooted yet again, in a continuity that became known as the \"Threeboot.\" This reality was later designated as <b>Earth-Prime</b>. Tinya Wazzo again went by the Phantom Girl codename and was a member of the Legion. She was a fan of old Earth comic books and had the biggest collection among the heroes. Bgtzl was now a world that was slightly out of phase with Earth and her phasing ability was actually her transporting herself between the planets. She was able to pass back and forth these worlds at will and could often be seen in both, regardless of what she might be doing in one. This led to strange situations and misunderstandings with her teammates. A friend and teammate, <a>Karate Kid</a>, had shown interest in Tinya. But when he finally got the courage to profess his feelings to Phantom Girl, he discovered that she was already in a relationship with a boy from her own dimension who was ironically breaking up with Tinya at the time. Phantom Girl became a member of the Legion's Espionage Squad and assisted covertly on many stealth missions, and was also instrumental in entering the Phantom Zone to help rescue Mon-El. Phantom Girl and Ultra Boy never became an item in this continuity.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1623759\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover_super.jpg\" title=\"Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1623759\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>The events of <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities. Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team, once again set on New Earth. Phantom Girl's history was now unaltered from before the Five Years Later. Phantom Girl remains the longest consecutively-serving Legionnaire and is still in a close relationship with Ultra Boy. Her current costume is an updated version of her classic \"portholes\" costume from the 70's, though it is now sleeveless and more form-fitting.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth</h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><p>Following the cataclysmic events of the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Legion continuity jumped ahead five years in what is known as the \"Five Year Gap.\" Ultra Boy finally proposed to Tinya, after which she boarded a shuttle to Bgztl to shop for a wedding dress. But a mechanical error tragically caused the ship to explode, apparently killing Phantom Girl. Her death would leave Ultra Boy in mourning for years. She was once thought to have survived the explosion by being hurled backwards in time (see <b>Alternate Versions</b> below), though this turned out to be a duplicate of Tinya rather than Tinya herself. When original Legion continuity was eventually wiped out by Zero Hour, the <a href=\"/time-trapper/29-25998/\">Time Trapper</a> fetched Tinya from the moment just before her death to say one last good-bye to Ultra Boy before the timeline collapsed.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Return as a Ghost</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"917055\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/917055-phantomgirl_43.jpg\" title=\"Tinya returns as a ghost (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"917055\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/917055-phantomgirl_43_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Tinya returns as a ghost (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tinya returns as a ghost (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Though Tinya's physical body had been killed by the Daxamite assassin, her spirit ultimately survived, with her energies tethered to Ultra Boy. Only Jo and her mother could initially see her, but soon <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> detected her and clued the rest of the Legionnaires in telepathically. While stranded in the 20th century, an encounter with <a href=\"../../deadman/29-5690/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman</a> and a mystic entity made Apparition's spirit visible to all onlookers. Shortly thereafter, Tinya and Jo were secretly married. While in the past, Apparition encountered the heroine Phase. The pair were absorbed into their touchstones when they came near each other and learned Phase was actually one of Tinya's missing bodies, having been lost in time after being sold into slavery. Pulling together to save Ultra Boy, the girls merged for the first time and Apparition was restored to a physical form. Apparition then returned with the Legion to the 30th century and reunited with her mother.</p><h4>Pregnancy</h4><p>Tinya was on a mission in deep space when the Blight attacked, crippling space travel and forcing Tinya to spend a month in a shuttle just to return to Earth. There, she found Ultra Boy had been blighted and aided the Legion in freeing Earth. Subsequently, Ultra Boy and several other Legionnaires were lost in a spatial rift and presumed dead. The Legion disbanded and Apparition, discovering she was pregnant after Jo had \"died,\" fled to his homeworld of <a href=\"../../rimbor/34-57117/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rimbor</a> to start a new life. Her Bgztlian pregnancy lasted a year, where she came under the protection of <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf</a> and his Wolf Pack gang. She had a healthy phase birth on the day the lost Legionnaires were revealed to be alive. Apparition resolved to rejoin the Legion with her newborn son, Cub, and Timber Wolf accompanied her to protect her. She learned that Ultra Boy had an affair with Saturn Girl during their year of being lost in space, but ultimately forgave him. The pair dealt with their son's rapid aging until Earth-247 was destroyed, leaving Apparition and her Legion the sole survivors as they were lost in the timestream. Tinya was equipped with a utility belt with rations and a transuit that allowed her to breathe in space.</p><h4>The Missing Body</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"846063\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" title=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"846063\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Late in Earth-247 continuity, it was revealed that Tinya's father was actually a Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), with the ability to split into three separate bodies, and Tinya had inherited this ability at birth. However, her father was also an chronic gambler who owed a fortune in gambling debts, so when Tinya was just a baby, he made a deal with the mysterious Luck Lords to sell off two of her bodies in order to pay off his debts. Her mother Winema never knew that Tinya's father was a Carggite and never knew about Tinya's other two bodies. One of Tinya's bodies was sold into slavery and her fate remained unknown. The other missing body later turned up in the 20th century in the form of Tinya's \"cousin,\" Enya Wazzo aka <a href=\"/phase/29-12983/\">Phase</a> (see Alternate Versions, below). Tinya traveled back in time to be reunited with Enya and upon meeting, they merged back into a single body and returned to the 30th century.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth Prime</h3><h4>Projectra's Betrayal</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"714266\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/714266-phantomgirl_projectra.jpg\" title=\"Attacked by Projectra (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"714266\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/714266-phantomgirl_projectra_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Attacked by Projectra (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Attacked by Projectra (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Phantom Girl developed a close bond with fellow Legionnaire <a href=\"/sensor-girl/29-6797/\">Princess Projectra</a>, who in Threeboot continuity was a selfish and troubled aristocrat. Tinya helped Projectra cope with the recent death of her parents by reading her ancient comic books from the 20th century, and politely tolerated Projectra's bratty and abusive behavior towards her. Tinya's closeness to Projectra enabled her to learn that Projectra secretly blamed the Legion for her parents' death and the loss of her family fortune. Upon further investigation, Tinya discovered that Projectra was plotting to destroy the Legion in revenge. But before Tinya could alert the Legion, Projectra found her out and savagely attacked her. Tinya initially defended herself by entering her phased state, but Projectra used her powers of illusion to trick Tinya into becoming tangible again and then beat Tinya nearly to death. Her comatose, disfigured body was discovered just in time by <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Timber Wolf</a>, who activated Tinya's alarm beacon. Tinya was brought to the Legion infirmary, where she began to recover, but Projectra then used her powers to alter Tinya's memories before she could tell the Legion what had happened. This plotline was left unresolved when Threeboot continuity was ended by Infinite Crisis.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intangibility</h3><p>Phantom Girl has the ability to turn intangible by shifting her existence partially or fully into the extra-dimensional space known as the Phantom Zone. She has demonstrated the ability to phase with split-second timing, and is also capable of phasing certain parts of her body selectively. While phased, she is immune to physical harm, can maneuver through solid objects, and float weightlessly like a ghost under her own power. She has additionally demonstrated the ability to disrupt the workings of electronic devices by moving through them while half-phased. When fully phasing out of reality, Tinya is able to enter the Phantom Zone of her own accord.</p><h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3><p>Phantom Girl has mastered a Bgztlian form of martial arts that takes full advantage of her ability to phase in and out of tangibility during combat. Her skill at striking opponents while solid and then becoming intangible when they attack has made her a formidable fighter. By partially materializing a portion of herself (usually her arm/fist) inside her opponent's body she can also deliver a severe shock to their system, though she rarely resorts to this form of attack.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Phantom Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>20th Century: Phase</h3><p><b>For further details</b>: <a href=\"/phase/29-12983/\">Phase</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"505628\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" title=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\"><img id=\"505628\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phase (Enya Wazzo)</div></div></div></div><p>After Tinya Wazzo apparently died when her starship exploded (following the Five Year Gap), she seemingly reappeared in the 20th century, but with no memories of her life in the 30th century. She joined that era's team known as <a href=\"/legion/65-47223/\">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a> and adopted the codename of <b>Phase</b>. It was later revealed in Earth-247 continuity that the original Tinya was half-Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), meaning that she could split into three separate bodies but had lost the ability because one of her bodies was missing in the timestream. Phase, also known as Enya Wazzo and originally believed to be Tinya's time-lost cousin, turned out to be that missing body. Upon learning of this, the 30th-century Tinya traveled back in time to find Enya. After finally being reunited, their two bodies merged back into one being and returned to the 30th century.</p><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"846065\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846065-phase_espionage.jpg\" title=\"Apparition (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"846065\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846065-phase_espionage_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Apparition (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Apparition (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>After the Five Year Gap, duplicate teenaged versions of the Legion mysteriously appeared, initially known as \"Batch SW6\" since they were believed to be clones of the original team created by the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a> prior to the death of <a href=\"../../ferro-lad/29-22592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ferro Lad</a>. Batch SW6 were later revealed to be time-paradox duplicates of the original Legion, rather than clones. They formed their own team and operated separately from the original Legion, calling themselves the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> and starring in their own series with that title. The Tinya Wazzo of SW6 initially called herself Phantom Girl and wore the original \"P\" costume. But she soon decided to differentiate herself from the original Tinya by changing her codename to <b>Apparition,</b> and adopted a black and white costume that became the prototype for the Earth-247 Apparition costume. As with her original counterpart, the SW6 Tinya was in a committed relationship with the SW6 version of Ultra Boy. The timeline of the SW6 duplicates was eventually wiped out by the <a href=\"/zero-hour/39-40782/\">Zero Hour</a> event.</p><h3>Elseworlds: Superboy's Legion</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2306628\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2306628-phantomgirl_superboys_legion.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl (Superboy's Legion)\"><img id=\"2306628\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2306628-phantomgirl_superboys_legion_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl (Superboy's Legion)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl (Superboy's Legion)</div></div></div></div><p>Phantom Girl appeared as a member of the Legion in <a href=\"/superboys-legion/49-21245/\">Superboy's Legion</a>, an <a href=\"/elseworlds/12-46699/\">Elseworlds</a> story. In this reality Tinya's mother Winema was the queen of their homeworld of Bgztl, making Tinya a princess. In appearance she closely resembled the Phantom Girl of original continuity and wore the original white costume with a stylized \"P\" on the chest. Series artist <a href=\"/alan-davis/26-2348/\">Alan Davis</a> drew her without pupils, giving her character a slightly more alien appearance.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4><b>Superman: The Animated Series</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1350284\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1350284-phantomgirl_anim_apparition_super.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)\"><img id=\"1350284\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1350284-phantomgirl_anim_apparition_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)</div></div></div></div><p>Phantom Girl had a cameo in the episode <i>New Kids in Town,</i> as one of several Legionnaires stationed in the 30th century.

She was one of the biggest cheerleaders of the team and a bit of a princess. Despite her status as a main character, she was one of the most infrequent main Legionnaires to appear and only had three speaking episodes in the second season.</p><p>In Season One, she stood against the <a href=\"/fatal-five/65-42802/\">Fatal Five</a> in <i>Man of Tomorrow</i>.

Dirk's father owned a nuclear power plant and Dirk worked as an assistant there as an adolescent. One of the scientists, <a href=\"/dr-regulus/29-31020/\">Dr. Zaxton Regulus</a>, was working on a machine when there was an accident, which resulted in the death of worker Zarl Hedricks. Dr. Zaxton was blamed for the accident and was dismissed. Angered, Dr, Zaxton blamed Dirk for the accident as he was the one who was sent to deliver supplies to him. In a rage, the doctor threw Dirk into an atomic reactor and left him to die. Dirk instead gained special powers due to his unique genetics and used them to help escape. For the adulation, Dirk took on the name Sun Boy and applied for the Legion, but was rejected in favor of <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> for that year's membership slots.

Early on he lost his powers and was sidelined, but they recovered. He became space happy on an extended mission in space where he was leader and locked up his teammates, who eventually saved him. Dirk was hit in the head during a press event and suffered amnesia just as Dr. Regulus returned to seek revenge. Dirk regained his memories in time to defeat his rival, doing so again years later when he returned after Dirk's 11 solar year (17-18 years) birthday party. His powers were instrumental in weakening the Servants of Darkness in the <a href=\"/great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\">Great Darkness Saga</a> but <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a> continuously knocked him out. During an encounter with the <a href=\"/emerald-empress/29-5946/\">Emerald Empress</a>, she broke Dirk's jaw for his back-talking. He recovered shortly thereafter. Dirk, notorious for quick relationships, had a steady one for a period of time then with <a href=\"/gigi-cusimano/29-51899/\">Gigi Cusimano</a>, an old friend of Dirk's buddy <a href=\"/colossal-boy/29-1271/\">Colossal Boy</a>. However Dirk ended that relationship as well.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556959\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556959-sunboy1_super.png\" title=\"Dirk Morgna (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"1556959\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556959-sunboy1_medium.png\" alt=\"Dirk Morgna (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dirk Morgna (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-247, Dirk Morgna once again was blamed for Dr. Regulus' firing and was left in an atomic reactor to die which gave him super-powers. However this Dirk's luminance could not be controlled, which caused him to go under scientific quarantine to protect others. Dirk became frustrated by his months in isolation and escaped to find his father, who had let him be admitted to such a place. During the confrontation with his father, the Legion arrived with a tromium-lined <a href=\"/legion-transuits/18-56566/\">transuit</a>. The suit muted Dirk's brightness and permitted him to interact with others again.</p><p>Dirk assisted the Legion on an assignment when Dr. Regulus took over one of <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/29-12846/\">Leland McCauley</a>'s factories. The battle exposed Dirk to more radiation, which cured him of his powers. Dirk then became the owner of the Magnoball team the Lodestones. He was shortly thereafter possessed by a fire elemental, turning Dirk into a fiery monster named Ph'yr of the <a href=\"/elements-of-disaster/65-52207/\">Elements of Disaster</a>. Dirk was one of the hosts to usurp control and survive, though this left Dirk with infrared vision. This led Dirk to be the first to spot the anti-energy cloud that went on to become Wildfire. Dirk, as well as the rest of Earth-247, was destroyed during <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1926924\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/1926924-sun_boy__001__01_.png\" title=\"Sun Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"1926924\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/1926924-sun_boy__001__01__thumb.png\" alt=\"Sun Boy (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sun Boy (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Dirk Morgna was once again a member of the Legion, now a youth rights movement. Dirk's parents were some of the few adults who supported the Legion enthusiastically, much to Dirk's embarrassment. Dirk was often a field leader among the Legion and had an over-confident, assertive personality that butted heads with <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a>'s leadership constantly. He previously had a relationship with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Light Lass</a>, which was short lived. Feeling stifled by his parents and never getting the opportunity in the Legion to properly come to his own as a leader, Sun Boy resigned from the team to lead a group of meta=humans called <a href=\"/terra-firma/65-47457/\">Terra Firma</a>, who had been manipulated by the villainous <a href=\"/lemnos/29-1268/\">Lemnos</a>.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1898523\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/1898523-314151335_super.jpg\" title=\"Sun Boy (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1898523\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/1898523-314151335_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Sun Boy (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sun Boy (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion to continuity before the Five Year Later, leaving Dirk once more alive and an active member of the Legion. He was kidnapped while <a href=\"/earth-man/29-32576/\">Earth-Man</a>'s <a href=\"/justice-league-of-earth/65-52497/\">Justice League</a> took over Earth and was hooked to a machine that drew his power so that the yellow sun of Earth could be turned red. He was eventually freed, but the experience left him drained physically and emotionally. Dirk sequestered himself from his teammates and initially refused to assist them when <a href=\"/superboy-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy-Prime</a> and the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/65-47190/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> went on a rampage. Two other Legions were recruited to assist and Earth Prime's Sun Boy was killed, which this Dirk felt. His counterpart's death pained him and reignited Dirk's fighting spirit. He aided the Legion in the villains' defeat and rejoined them properly.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></span></span></h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556962\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556962-sunboy4_super.png\" title=\"Dirk Morgna (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1556962\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556962-sunboy4_thumb.png\" alt=\"Dirk Morgna (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dirk Morgna (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>During the off-panel period of time known as the Five Year Later, Dirk became the leader of Legion and after a series of defections, he left the group. He was hired by Earthgov as a public relations liaison and used his popularity to get the public's opinion. When Earthgov is exposed to be under the control of <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>, Dirk is branded a traitor to Earth and his teammates. Dirk gets exposed to a fatal does of radiation when a power-sphere explodes during the destruction of the Moon and gets mercy killed by his lover, Circe. His body was later possessed to help sustain his old teammate, <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildfire</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth Prime</h3><h4>The Death of Sun Boy</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"726338\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/726338-prime_052_super.jpg\" title=\"Superboy-Prime kills Dirk\"><img id=\"726338\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/726338-prime_052_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Superboy-Prime kills Dirk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Superboy-Prime kills Dirk</div></div></div></div><p>His time with Terra Firma proved difficult as its members refused to fully reform from their criminal ways. Ultimately, Dirk's conscience got the best of him and he personally saw to it that all his teammates were jailed. Defeated but still willing to fight the good fight, Dirk returned to the Legion and insisted they even put it to a vote to see if they wanted him back. The team voted Sun Boy back in just in time for Dirk and his Legion to team with two others to save the Legion of New Earth. During this battle, <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> froze Sun Boy with his freezing breath and then shattered him, killing him. He was later resurrected as a member of the <a href=\"../../black-lantern-corps/65-50743/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Lantern Corps</a> but died again.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Fire Control</h3><p>Dirk Morgna has the ability to tap into internalized solar power, allowing him to project luminance and heat to whatever degree he desires. He is able to project light bright enough to lead to permanent blindness and that could be seen from miles away in space. He can concoct heat within seconds that can melt through steel or be tossed as fireballs. In the postboot reality, Dirk also had infrared vision and could detect heat patterns.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Sun Boy possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556961\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556961-sunboy3_super.png\" title=\"Inferno (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"1556961\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556961-sunboy3_medium.png\" alt=\"Inferno (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Inferno (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Before the death of Dirk, members of the Dominator's Batch SW6 escaped captivity. There were shown as being time-displaced Legionnaires from the team's fifth year with Dirk among their number. The Batch SW6 duplicates survived the destruction of Earth and became the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> of <a href=\"../../new-earth/34-57126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth</a>. This Dirk took the codename Inferno. He was best friends with <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Live Wire</a> and had a habit of womanizing and belittling others. He was one of the Legionnaires who drove <a href=\"../../emerald-empress/29-5946/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cera Kesh</a> to be the new Emerald Empress and he had a romance with a mermaid named Keiki. When all the other Legionnaires without adult counterparts began to vanish when the timeline was collapsing, Dirk questioned as to why he was immune with his counterpart deceased. Wildfire confronted him and revealed he had taken the elder Dirk's body. The pair then merged together with the other Legionnaires to reboot their collapsing timeline during <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>Superman &amp; the Legion of Super-Heroes</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556966\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556966-sunboy4_super.png\" title=\"Sun Boy (S&amp;LSH)\"><img id=\"1556966\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556966-sunboy4_medium.png\" alt=\"Sun Boy (S&amp;LSH)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sun Boy (S&LSH)</div></div></div></div><p>Dirk appeared as Sun Boy, a member of the Legion yet again, in the Legion's two season cartoon. This version was depicted with long hair and inflamed eyes. He had no lines throughout the run of the show and was often depicted as a trusted assistant to Cosmic Boy, causing him to be absent like Cosmic Boy for much of the first season. He made his first appearance as a cameo on a vidscreen during \"Timber Wolf\" and aided the Legion in protecting Earth's atmosphere in \"The Substitutes.\" He fought against the <a href=\"/sun-eater/29-47363/\">Sun Eater</a> in the two part \"Sundown.\" In the second season, Dirk was one of many Legionnaires captured on <a href=\"/takron-galtos/34-56390/\">Takron-Galtos</a> but later released in the second part of \"Man from the Edge of Tomorrow.\" He sat as jury at <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Timber Wolf'</a>s trial and ultimately hunted him down in \"Cry Wolf.\" He was depicted as one of the original Legionnaires in \"In the Beginning\" and fought against <a href=\"/brainiac/29-4684/\">Brainiac</a> in the two part \"Dark Victory.\"</p>",

Having violated the Legion code against killing, a trial was held and Star Boy was found guilty and expelled from the Legion.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759261\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759261-starboy_super.jpg\" title=\"Star Boy (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"759261\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759261-starboy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-247, Thom Kallor was one of the few denizens of Xanthu to be born with a superpower. He was recruited quickly by the government as an adolescent to be a part of the <a href=\"/uncanny-amazers/65-47187/\">Uncanny Amazers</a> and was up for the title of Planetary Champion when the Legion of Super-Heroes was founded. Thom was not Xanthu's initial pick as draftee into the Legion, but upon <a href=\"/james-cullen/29-47877/\">Kid Quantum</a>'s death they opted for Star Boy to be their new representative. As Thom prepared to set off for Earth, a mourning <a href=\"/kid-quantum/29-1520/\">Kid Quantum II</a> rigged Thom's space cruiser so that he couldn't turn its music off. This distraction caused Thom to crash, where he spent several weeks in a body cast recovering. During that time, he was nursed with some exotic whale that sped up his recovery but also granted him Kryptonian-like powers which he discovered upon properly joining the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"170012\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"170012\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>The Star Boy of Earth Prime differed from other realities in that he was of African descent. His origin otherwise was never specified to be any different. He was still from the planet Xanthu. Thom was a member of the Legion again and a big supporter and defendant of initial leader Cosmic Boy. Dream Girl had expressed interest in him before her death, though it was never stated Thom reciprocated. He sided with Cosmic Boy when the Legion stood divided between Cos and Brainiac 5 but pulled together with the rest of his team to defeat Terra Firma. He traveled to <a href=\"/winath/34-56915/\">Winath</a> months later to search for the missing Cosmic Boy and instead found <a href=\"/lightning-lord/29-3592/\">Lightning Lord</a>, who was charged with the war crimes previously placed on Cos. Wielding the power of gravity like Thom did made him instrumental to several of the Legion's later victories, especially when guided by Brainiac 5's precise calculations. He was often paired with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Light Lass</a> for the most dynamic results.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"84466\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1480/84466-13043-starman_super.jpg\" title=\"Starman (New Earth)\"><img id=\"84466\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1480/84466-13043-starman_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Starman (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Starman (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored an analogue of the original Legion to continuity. Following the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/39-56080/\">Magic Wars</a>, Star Boy rejoined the team and was one of several Legionnaires who assisted <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> on a covert mission to the 21st century. While traveling through time, Star Boy became unhinged and came to reside on Earth-22, the <a href=\"/kingdom-come/39-41641/\">Kingdom Come</a> reality. He later used his powers on his costume again to travel to New Earth proper. Shortly upon arriving, Thom discovered that the ancient medicine of that era wasn't enough to keep his schizophrenia in check and he had to cope with his mental illness. This made him lucid enough that he forgot his initial mission, instead taking on the name \"Danny Blaine\" from a Xanthu pulp hero and deciding to defend <a href=\"/opal-city/34-47880/\">Opal City</a> like the <a href=\"/starman/49-5259/\">Starmen</a> before him. He even took on their codename.</p><p>Homeless, he was quickly taken in by Opal's Sunshine Sanitarium to help with his mental confusion. It was there he fell in love with sloppy joes. Shortly thereafter, his heroic efforts in Opal caught the attention of the reformed <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\">Justice Society of America</a> and Thom was recruited.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Star Boy x Dream Girl</h4><p>Upon his expulsion, Thom was met by Dream Girl and recruited into the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The pair later left the Subs and donned suits of armor to hide their identities as they joined the Legion as <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy</a> and <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>'s replacements, per their request. Following Thom's adventure as Sir Prize, the Legion elected to bring Star Boy and Dream Girl back onto the team despite their past actions. Star Boy served on the Legion for many years and continued his relationship with Dream Girl, even during a strained part of their relationship years later when Dream Girl was elected Legion leader. She eventually offered Thom the job of her deputy leader so they could spend more time together, which he only begrudgingly accepted because her term was almost over. On a mission to Xanthu and following a rough patch with Dreamy, Thom was commanded by his people's government to serve as their new planetary champion. Star Boy accepted the position and resigned from the Legion to care for his homeworld. He warded off <a href=\"../../atmos/29-28222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atmos</a> in battle several times to keep the title, though he lost Dream Girl to the other hero.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><p>Star Boy rejoined the Legion following the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a> but only served for a short time. With the Legion falling on dark times, Thom returned to Xanthu. He fell in love with and later married Yvyya, the owner of the Naltorian Dreamers batball team. Thom retired from heroics and became their coach, though he did come out of retirement during <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>. With his timeline collapsing, Star Boy joined his past teammates in helping to rescue <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> and ultimately sacrificed himself to reboot the universe.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Star Boy in the 21st century</h4><p>As a Legionnaire, Star Boy was inducted with the draft dodging <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates</a> and was often scrutinized by <a href=\"../../colossal-boy/29-1271/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviathan</a>, who felt responsible for the death of Thom's predecessor and refused to let Thom end up like Kid Quantum. Star Boy helped assemble the Fatal Five and was one of many Legionnaires spared being trapped in the 20th century. When the Legion held open auditions for the first time, Star Boy was on the judging panel and it was there he met his future girlfriend, Dreamer. Thom was smitten with her and they began to date shortly thereafter. He returned to Xanthu several times to both cement his position in the Legion and to help ward off an invasion. He was distraught when Xanthu ceded from the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets</a> to the Allied Planets and refused a call to return home with the other Xanthian Legionnaires. One visit to Xanthu also led him to team up with <a href=\"../../jack-knight/29-23783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Knight</a>, a time-lost hero named Starman. Thom then learned of his destiny to one day be the Starman of the 21st century.</p><h4>Robotica Invaded</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"891602\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01__super.png\" title=\"Star Boy vs Robotica\"><img id=\"891602\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01__medium.png\" alt=\"Star Boy vs Robotica\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy vs Robotica</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually, Thom's Kryptonian superpowers began to haywire. Due to his liability in the field, Star Boy was sidelined. These powers ultimately faded and Thom returned to active duty in time to be captured during the Blight Invasion. He was later freed but elected to leave the Legion when Dreamer began having nightmares. They traveled to Xanthu and worked with the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khunds</a> to fine-tune both Dreamer and Thom's powers. Instead of just inducing mass, Star Boy learned how to decrease it as well. When Robotica invaded Xanthu, Star Boy ultimately stayed behind with former teammate <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XS</a> when the planet was evacuated. They were saved from their exile weeks later by a reformed Legion, which Thom rejoined and later Dreamer joined as well. Thom was spared from the destruction of Earth-247 because the Legion had been lost in the timestream on an adventure. He pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiverse</a> with his Legion to become the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>Starman carry out R.J.

Freeing Nura, Thom was reminded of his original mission in the past. He rejoined with the other Legionnaires and they successfully used lightning rods to gather the essence of the deceased <a href=\"../../bart-allen/29-1680/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bart Allen</a>. When the other Legionnaires returned home, Thom remained in the past with the Justice Society to aid Brainiac 5 in one other contingency. Thom took a job as a grave digger and dug up the body of <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conner Kent</a> and took it to a rejuvenation chamber in the <a href=\"../../fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortress of Solitude</a> which would resurrect the hero over the span of a 1,000 years. All the while, he continued to act as Starman and assisted the JSA with threats such as <a href=\"../../gog/29-55664/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gog</a> and the new <a href=\"../../injustice-society/65-22535/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Injustice Society</a>. Gog even restored Thom's sanity for a time. Already in the 21st century, he became a de facto member of the Legion on a mission in the past to carry out <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>'s Last Will and Testament, protecting the bottled cities Brainiac had stolen. With his last mission in the past finally complete, Starman was presumed to return to the future.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Gravity Control</h3><p>Star Boy possesses the ability to control the gravitational force of an object. He does so by borrowing the gravity from stars and redirecting this force onto a designated area. He can sink cities and pinpoint it to objects smaller than pebbles. He is capable of drawing enough mass to create a black hole by recreating the weight of a collapsing star. Thom wears a suit crafted together by three different Brainiac 5's that is a map of the multiverse. It is fine tuned so that Thom's mass induction ability when properly applied can create small wormholes into these realities or transport himself. It is a skill he has yet to refine.</p><h3>Kryptonian</h3><p>Previously, after crashing through a comet tail, he gained the powers of a Kryptonian as well as the ability to breathe fire. In the postboot, he also gained electrical vision. In both iterations, these abilities were only temporary.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759269\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759269-starboy_super.jpg\" title=\"Star Boy (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"759269\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759269-starboy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Zero Hour created a blip which added a young Star Boy to the SW6, time-displaced <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> team.

Tasmia has the blue skin and pointed ears typical of her race, and as the Talokian champion she has the power to create and manipulate darkness. Tasmia has adapted to the harsh desert terrain of Talok VIII and kept very true to her people's beliefs and rituals. She and her younger cousin Grev Mallor received their powers from their ancestors, whose spirits reside in a mysterious and forbidden cave beneath the surface of the planet. When they entered the cavern their ancestors spoke to them, casting a pitch black cloud which acted on their genetic heritage and unleashed their powers. As her ancestors before her for the past thousand years, Tasmia is a hereditary shadow champion of Talok VIII. Her 20th-century ancestors Lydea Mallor (<a href=\"/darkstar/29-47236/\">Darkstar</a>) and <a href=\"/lyrissa-mallor/29-27359/\">Lyrissa Mallor</a> were shadow champions as well as members of the interstellar police force called <a href=\"../../legion/65-47223/\" rel=\"nofollow\">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a> In this extended history of ancestral champions, Tasmia trained extremely long and hard to assert her power and status among her people.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Shadow Lass was created in 1968 by writer <a href=\"/jim-shooter/26-40450/\">Jim Shooter</a> and <a href=\"/curt-swan/26-21274/\">Curt Swan</a>.

But she seized the opportunity to request the aid of the Legion of Super-Heroes and led them to her homeworld. The Legion made Tasmia a temporary Legionnaire during the ensuing battle, and together they defeated the Fatal Five. Afterward Tasmia was offered full membership into the Legion and she accepted, taking the code name of Shadow Lass. She became the first Legionnaire in history to win membership directly through battle. Tasmia's cousin Grev, who also wielded the shadow power thanks to his bloodline, went on to join the <a href=\"../../legion-academy/65-47210/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Academy</a> as <a href=\"../../shadow-lad/29-47294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Kid</a>, though he was aware that he could never join the team while Tasmia was an active member, due to a Legion rule prohibiting members with the same powers. Both cousins hoped that Grev's training at the Academy would give him the skills necessary to protect their homeworld during Tasmia's absence.</p><p>After joining the Legion, Shadow Lass became romantically involved with a teammate, the Daxamite <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El</a> (also known as Lar Gand).

Eventually they married after Mon-El was mortally wounded fighting the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> as part of a major conspiracy to avenge Superboy's death at the Trapper's hands. Mon-El recovered, but the marriage was rocky for many years despite their strong feelings for each other. Mon-El was later killed in action, and Shadow Lass went into mourning. Her grief was brought to an end after Mon-El seemingly returned from the dead. However, it turned out that he was now inhabited by the Time Trapper's essence. A cataclysmic battle then erased the Trapper from existence and completely rewrote reality, causing Shadow Lass to lose her husband yet again.</p><h3>Five Years Later: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2139576\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2139576-2139572-SL34.jpg\" title=\"Tasmia Mallor Gand (Five Yaers Later)\"><img id=\"2139576\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2139576-2139572-SL34_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Tasmia Mallor Gand (Five Yaers Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tasmia Mallor Gand (Five Yaers Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Tasmia went on to wander the galaxy with her husband Gand.

At birth she was taken from her mother, the then-current Champion, in a bid to ensure that no single accident or attack could ever claim both of them, and saw her only seven times during her lifetime, all at solemn ceremonies in which they were forbidden to speak. As she grew up, she was raised by priests and was trained in combat and drilled in the order of her bloodline. She loved it. Finally, one day, her mother was killed in battle and she was brought before the leaders of Talok VIII's twelve tribes - the only time they would ever congregate peacefully - before entering the Shadow Cave, where she met the spirits of her mother and the other prior Champions. After they chastised her for never wondering how her mother died, she took to heart their counsel to protect Talok VIII (but not their warning against egocentrism) and they told her to Go In Power. On leaving the cave, she found the inhabitants of Talok VIII on their knees, waiting for a sign - which she provided when she let the Shadows loose. After that, she became the Champion, using her position to give orders to leaders and priests, all in maintenance of the Old Ways. This lasted until the ship came. The United Planets ship came in peace, proselytizing the benefits of U.P. membership. Sent to greet the \"invaders,\" she understood none of it , and she set about dismantling the \"hideous\" ship and crew. Despite their best efforts, she caused an explosion that caused the ship's landing gear to collapse. After that, the priests (who had already been harboring doubts about the \"zealot\") kept her drugged until UP entry negotiations were complete. Profoundly disturbed by the cultural influx and Talok's \"captitulance\", she was eventually \"dismissed\", and told to study the galaxy to \"open her mind.\"</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"526019\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/526019-1.jpg\" title=\"Shadow Lass (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"526019\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/526019-1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow Lass (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shadow Lass (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Not much is known about Tasmia, except that she loves being in the Legion of Super-Heroes.

As part of the Legion, she fought Mordru, and later played a key part in saving <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildfire</a> - despite, after her initial fierce compassion, being disgusted at the thought of the forcible integration of his two original souls. Far later, the Blight enslaved most of Earth, including all but a few of the Legionnaires. Umbra was not among these escapees. When she was freed, she began to have a mental breakdown, prompted not only by the fact of her enslavement and what she'd been forced to do, but by the fact that the Blight's touching of her mind had meant that she'd <i>enjoyed</i> it. Shortly thereafter, she became one of the Legionnaires lost through a space rift and catapulted into another galaxy. There, she became harder and colder than ever in lieu of breaking down completely and showing the fear that now guided her, while the voices of her ancestors from the shadow became faint and hard to understand. Then <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> tried to telepathically calm her, and it all went wrong - a telepathic matrix over a whole planet interfered with her powers, and the result left Saturn Girl in a coma, a shadow-creature fueled by Umbra and Saturn Girl's combined pain and fear loose on the ship - and an Umbra completely without pain or anxiety, leaving only anger and arrogant self-confidence. She went down to the planet, where she began to fight <a href=\"/singularity/29-12824/\">Singularity</a> (a <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>-like being), for whom the telepathic illusion which had caused the trouble was being maintained (to keep him from causing trouble on his race's real planet). When <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a> and <a href=\"../../monstress/29-12837/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monstress</a> went down to get her, she began to fight them too. Finally, she was knocked out by Singularity while the Legion, having captured the shadow-creature and realized what it was, knocked out the illusion causing Singularity to go looking for his original planet. Then <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> managed to restore Umbra and Saturn Girl's minds, and Umbra finally broke down in a crying heap.</p><h4>Return Home</h4><p>After this she finally began to heal from everything that had happened to her - until, after they managed to return to UP space, her power mysteriously cut out. To find out what had happened, she finally returned to Talok VIII for the first time since her dismissal. There she found a planet completely cloaked in shadow, and a shadow which knocked her out. Shadow Maven, one of the priests who had trained her, found her and told her that after her loss in the rift, they had believed her dead and managed to empower her \"distant cousin Grev\" with the shadows through the use of technology, and had him cloak the planet completely, withdrawing from the United Planets. Angry at the thought that just as she had accepted the galaxy Talok had turned away from it, she went to confront Grev. The shadow gradually leeched back to her, until she split open the suit Grev used to control the shadow - and found a withered corpse inside, as he had been unable to withstand being a conduit for the Shadow, while the suit ran on its last programmed directives. She cast the shadow-cloak from the planet, and spent some time there before returning to the Legion.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>Affair with Earth-Man</h4><p>Recently Shadow Lass appeared to have broken up with Mon-El, with no reason truly given.

When Tasmia found out that Mon-El was chosen to be a <a href=\"/green-lantern/12-41148/\">Green Lantern</a>, she felt a bit uneasy about it.

The intense darkness that she creates can engulf large areas of space almost instantly, causing an absolute absence of light which very few (like <a href=\"../../projectra/29-6797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sensor Girl</a>) can penetrate with their vision. Shadow Lass is able to control the shape of her darkness, from a large amorphous cloud to a tight beam of concentrated shadows. Those trapped within her darkness become disoriented and deprived of their senses, driving many enemies to the point of experiencing rampant fear and helplessness. Shadow Lass is completely immune to the effects of the darkness she generates and is able to see perfectly through it.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>Shadow Lass is a superb athlete and hand-to-hand combatant who learned great fighting skill from her native people as their chosen champion.

They enjoyed the Academy so much that when the Legion Constitution changed to allow married couples, they opted to stay reserves.</p><h4>Losing Another Body</h4><p>Years later, Luornu and Chuck helped form a new <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> with the retired <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> and <a href=\"../../night-girl/29-12875/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Night Girl.</a> When Superboy from the Pocket Universe was killed by the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a>, Duo Damsel was devastated. She joined a conspiracy with other Legion members, including <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl,</a> <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El</a>. They made a pact to break the Legion code and kill the Time Trapper. In the ensuing battle, Duo Damsel lost another duplicate and was left powerless with a single body. She continued on as an instructor at the Legion Academy but decided her fighting days were behind her after losing two of her selves, rejecting Brainiac 5's gift of a force field belt so that she could continue being a heroine.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1799395\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1799395-275px_luornu_durgo_001_super.jpg\" title=\"Luornu Durgo (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1799395\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1799395-275px_luornu_durgo_001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Luornu Durgo (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Luornu Durgo (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>The Legion Academy had become the United Planets Military Academy after the Legion disbanded. Luornu and Chuck remained instructors with several of their former students despite the change. When the Legion reformed, they continued to assist their friends where they could but were usually busy with other duties in assisting the U.P. militia. One day, Luornu was kidnapped in the middle of the night and Chuck had to go to the Legion for help. Several other people had gone missing too - all Legionnaires who had been party to the conspiracy years ago. <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a>, who had reshaped the timeline with her as the Time Trapper, was now the villain the Legion had conspired to kill in that continuity. They had unknowingly failed, Glorith using her age-altering powers to restore herself as well as Luornu's second body, which acted as her soldier. Luornu was eventually set free thanks to her second body turning on Glorith. During this adventure, Luornu also discovered that she had force field powers - the belt Brainy had given her years ago had internalized them in her just to be safe. Safe and sound, Luornu returned home with her second body and a new super power. Still, she opted to remain with the U.P. militia.</p><h3> <b>Reboot: Earth-247</b></h3><h4>Joining the Legion</h4><p>After Brande was saved from an attempted robbery from three super-powered people, he decided to create a legion of heroes and asked Luorno to track each of those three super-powered people. After she did, she aided them in helping to clear the United Planet assembly hall during a terrorist attack. Her actions that day inspired the founding Legionnaires to invite her to be one of their first recruits as Triad. Luornu was a stalwart member, serving consistently with the team save for a period of time where she had to recover from wounds dealt by bigoted White Triangle members. When several Legionnaires were stranded in the 20th century, Triad willing became stranded with them when the two teams of Legionnaires met up later in order to bring Cosmic Boy important medical equipment to save his life. She returned with the stranded Legionnaires later and served until the team was disbanded by the government after a stargate tragedy cost half the team.</p><h4>Running R.J.

She handled the responsibility surprisingly well and helped cover for R.J. as he secretly set out to build Legion World and assemble the future of his team of heroes. When the Legionnaires thought dead resurfaced later from a lost galaxy, Triad was quick to come to their aid and reorganized the Legion of Super-Heroes with the others. Due to her great ability at multi-tasking, she often took charge of Legion World's communication hub. She continued to serve with the team until the end of Earth-247, where the Legionnaires were lost in the timestream. Following an adventure where the Legions of three different worlds came together, Triad and her fellow Legionnaires decided to venture the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a> to help others without a time and home.</p><h3> <b>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</b></h3><h4>Joining the Legion</h4><p>In time, Cargg was visited by members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Three clones, combining into one, decided to leave with them, to investigate the United Planets and the Legion as well. They took the codename Triplicate Girl. She was a member of the Legion for a year, enjoying adventures and trying new things, before she returned to her home planet. However, when Triplicate Girl reached Cargg, her other selves found her too unfamiliar. They refused to assimilate with Triplicate Girl, making her feel lost. She returned to the Legion, serving stalwartly and dating <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a> until she and Karate Kid were approached in the middle of a mission by persons unknown. They pleaded the two heroes to come with them quickly, weighing their work in their own time with the peril their visitors faced. Whatever it was, Triplicate Girl and Karate Kid agreed to go with their visitors. The storyline was never resolved before the title was canceled.Triplicate Girl showed a great deal of loyalty to the Legion's first leader, Cosmic Boy. She had gone on dates with various Legionnaires, including <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Boy</a>, Element Lad, and <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>, simply to divine information from them for Cos.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Duplication</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2524996\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2524996-duplicategirl_duplicating.jpg\" title=\"Duplicate Girl duplicating\"><img id=\"2524996\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2524996-duplicategirl_duplicating_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Duplicate Girl duplicating\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Duplicate Girl duplicating</div></div></div></div>\n<p>As Duplicate Girl, Luornu currently has the power to split herself into an unlimited number of identical bodies. When she assimilates back together, Luornu gains the knowledge and memories that each body experienced while separated. Previous incarnations of the character (Triplicate Girl and Triad) could only split into a maximum of three bodies, while Duo Damsel could only split into two bodies due to the death of the third.</p><p>Unlike other incarnations, the reboot (Earth-247) Triad's bodies manifested three separate and distinct personalities who shared a mental and physical link. Because of her separate personalities she preferred to remain in triplicated form. At one point each body also manifested very different physical characteristics (though they still had the same facial features): One was unusually tall and strong, one was much smaller and faster, and the third was normal-sized.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>Luornu has mastered a specialized Carggite form of martial arts called Trijitsu, which was developed by her people to take full advantage of three forms fighting simultaneously. Now that she can create an endless number of duplicates as Duplicate Girl, Lournu can fight like a virtual army acting in concert, making her a truly formidable opponent.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Duplicate Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p><b>Height:</b> 5' 6\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 130 lbs</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Brown (one eye is Purple)</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Brown</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"193758\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8669/193758-61373-triplicate-girl_super.jpg\" title=\"Triad (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"193758\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8669/193758-61373-triplicate-girl_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Triad (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Triad (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>A younger version of Luornu was found with several other young Legionnaires, called Batch SW6.

She served with the team until <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, where the elder Luornu and Triad merged together to help right the timestream and create a new future alongside their respective teammates.</p><h3>Triplicate</h3><p>\"Triplicate\" was a <a href=\"/bizarro/29-8312/\">Bizarro</a> version of the character, who could split herself into three pieces of her body.</p><h3>Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century</h3><p>Triplicate Girl appeared in several issues Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century.</p><h3>Multiple Maid/Myriad</h3><p>In a DC/Marvel crossover series, <a href=\"/myriad/29-62473/\">Multiple Maid</a> was an amalgamation of Triplicate Girl and the Marvel character <a href=\"/madrox/29-7910/\">Multiple Man</a>, who also has the power of duplication.

She was voiced by Kari Wahlgren. Unlike the comic book version, animated Triplicate Girl had hair that was three different colors -- orange, purple, and white -- and when she triplicated, each separate body had one of the three colors, with a matching costume. During the first season, she became one of Bouncing Boy's biggest cheerleaders and was overjoyed when he was elected leader.</p><p>In the second season, her white third body was 'erased' due to a temporal accident on an adventure in the 40th century. Luornu took the loss of her third body hard, even brushing aside concern from Bouncing Boy at times. Luornu changed her code name to Duo Damsel and her appearance changed to reflect her mourning. The white in her hair and costume became black. Later that season the time stream was corrected and the white third body returned, to the delight of the other two.</p>",

Jan has always been one of the most powerful members of the Legion, yet one of the most withdrawn. His mental discipline, which guarded him from accidentally killing people with a stray thought, allowed few people to get close to him. This changed when he met <a href=\"/science-police/65-23409/\">the Science Police</a> liaison to the Legion, <a href=\"/shvaughn-erin/29-6967/\">Shvaughn Erin</a>. Their relationship grew at a pivotal time in Jan's Legion career. After serving as the team's deputy leader, he was appointed to the post by <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Lightning Lad</a>, who resigned. He was angered to lose the ensuing election to <a href=\"/dream-girl/29-1254/\">Dream Girl</a>, (coming in second for the <em>fourth</em> time) but bounced back after that to win two full terms for himself. Jan and Shvaughn made a good team. They worked together to investigate suspicious things surrounding the Legionnaire <a href=\"/chameleon-girl/29-50657/\">Shrinking Violet</a> and eventually uncovered the fact that she'd been replace by a <a href=\"/durlan/29-4624/\">Durlan</a> spy.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1562498\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1562498-elementlad02.png\" title=\"Alchemist (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"1562498\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1562498-elementlad02_medium.png\" alt=\"Alchemist (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Alchemist (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Young Jan\u2019s eagerness to help actually saves his life. Once again, Roxxas the butcher leads a band of his merry men to wipe out Trom, but this time there are a few differences. This version of Roxxas is a rabid xenophobe, who believes that his people are superior to all other races, and are perfectly justified in destroying their lives and cultures to protect their uniqueness. Another important catch: Roxxas comes from <a href=\"/daxam/34-42416/\">Daxam</a>, and he and his posse have the full powers of <a href=\"/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-El</a>.

Joining the team, Jan at first doesn\u2019t choose a code-name: Element Lad, but he still has the same sense of honor and the spiritual bent that we have come to know.

His power included transmutation of elements through touch, although the transmuted objects would revert back to their original chemical compositions after a minute. Jan's reasons for joining the Legion were that he saw them as a nexus of great change, something all Trommites would have appreciated. <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon</a> mentioned that Element Lad was the sole survivor of his planet, Trom, although that was never elaborated on.</p><p>Some of the Legionnaires, Element Lad included, aided Brainiac 5 in his resurrection attempt on Dream Girl, although Jan was personally against the idea. The attempt seemed to have failed when Dream Girl's body disappeared, and Element Lad unsuccessfully tried to convince Brainiac to let her go.

Element Lad's history was now unaltered from before the Five Years Later. It's revealed that New Earth's Element Lad is undercover as Smallville high's science teacher.

It is revealed that Shvaughn had been born as a male named Sean, and had taken a futuristic sex-change drug called ProFem in order to secure Element Lad's love. With ProFem no longer available in the tough economical times, Shvaughn reverts back to Sean; Jan is unfazed, saying <i>\"Look, it doesn't matter. Don't you understand ... ? Anything we ever shared physically ... it was in spite of the ProFem, not because of it ... !\"</i></p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Jan Transmuted Himself</h4><p>Element Lad continued to explore the limits of his abilities, even successfully transmuting <i>himself</i>. He discovered this somewhat by accident with the sorcerer Mordru turned him to crystal. Though his awareness was expanded, he found it more difficult to change other objects unless he first changed himself to a similar substance. The transformation made Jan's mind somewhat unstable for a while.</p><h4>Legion Lost</h4><p>Following the Blight's attack on Earth, Element Lad was one of ten Legionnaires who disappeared into a rift in space. The rift transported them into a void. He was the first to awake and transformed himself into Tromium crystal\nin order to survive. He gathered up the Legionnaires and sheathed them in Tromium as well, which had the effect of time-stasis.</p><h4>Enter Progenitor</h4><p>Recording his thoughts in memory crystals, he calculated a way to move the Outpost back to ordinary space. He was successful, but the Legion re-entered space in another galaxy, far from home. Jan himself entered the same galaxy, but billions of years in its past, while the universe was in its infancy. The Tromium made him immortal, and he drifted for billions of years, completely alone, watching stars and planets come into being. When planets began to bear life, he used his powers to accelerate their evolution. His tinkering gave rise to many races, including the Progeny and the Kwai. He eventually became known as the Progenitor and created for himself a home world called the Rosette. By this point, there was very little of the boy who was Jan Arrah. The Progenitor acted like a god, ordering the Progeny to \"delete\" any life forms which he considered \"variants.\" Eventually his timeline caught up to that of his fellow Legionnaires. They had been fighting the Progeny and finally met the aliens' master. Jan barely remembered them.</p><h4>The Death of Progenitor</h4><p>When he learned that they intended to return to their home galaxy, the Progenitor hatched a plan to follow them. He intended to remake that galaxy, too. He told the Legionnaires that he also intended to destroy all life in this Second Galaxy before he left. Of course, his former teammates could not allow either of these things. When they opposed the Progenitor, he killed <a href=\"/monstress/29-12837/\">Monstress</a>. To defeat him, the Legion managed to release the Omniphagos, a being that the Progenitor intended to use to erase all life. It took all the Progenitor's powers to subdue the creature. Meantime, the Legionnaires made it through a space warp home. They lost another one of their number, <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Live Wire</a>, who sacrificed himself to overload the Omniphagos with electricity.</p><h4>Live Wire is Element Lad</h4><p>Back home, Element Lad was memorialized on Trom with the memory crystals that remained from the Second Galaxy. In time, something miraculous happened\u2014Live Wire emerged from the crystals, his mind imprinted on the former crystalline body of Element Lad! With the help of the Brainiac 5 of Earth-0, Live Wire eventually recovered enough to change his own form back to normal.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>The Death of Element Lad</h4><p>Like every active Legionnaire of his world and Earth-247, Element Lad was transported to the 31st century New Earth, to help the present Legion combat <a href=\"/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy-Prime</a>, and the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/65-47190/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a>. When <a href=\"/sun-boy/29-1259/\">Sun Boy</a> was murdered by Superboy-Prime on New Earth, Element Lad decided to put his qualms about violence aside to avenge his friend. He managed, notably enough, to create Kryptonite that Superboy-Prime showed to be vulnerable against (he had earlier been immune to the radioactive substance, due to Kryptonians only being affected by Kryptonite from their respective universes). In his rampage, Prime responded by launching one of the Kryptonite rocks through Element Lad's torso, killing him. A while after Prime was defeated, Brainiac 5 of New Earth explained that the reason Prime was vulnerable to Jan's Kryptonite, was that Element Lad and his Legion were from the reality of Earth-Prime themselves.</p><p>During the events of Legion of Three Worlds, the Element Lad native to the New Earth universe (supposedly the same as the original, pre-Crisis version of him) had been reported as missing. The Legion had not heard from him since the start of <a href=\"/superman-and-the-legion-of-superheroes/39-55650/\">Earth-Man's xenophobic campaign</a>.</p><h4>Black Lantern Element Lad</h4><p>Element Lad was one of many people who Superboy-Prime had killed, he travel from the future to Earth-Prime to kill Prime.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Transmute</h3><p>Element Lad have the ability to transmute substances on the atomic level. This a native ability to their home world, Trom. The Element Lad of Earth-Prime's transformations only lasted 60 seconds, and he had to be in contact with the material.</p><h3>Divine Powers</h3><p>The Element Lad of Earth-247 he had also learned how to change his own chemical make-up. As the Progenitor, he lived over billions of years, in the Second Galaxy. In this time, he learned to use his abilities to actually create (or destroy) life, making him near-omnipotent.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Element Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.The utility belt houses rations and a <a href=\"../../legion-transuits/18-56566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">transuit</a> that allows Element Lad to travel in space.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2068368\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2068368-alchemist_sw6_001.png\" title=\"Alchemist (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"2068368\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2068368-alchemist_sw6_001_medium.png\" alt=\"Alchemist (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Alchemist (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>At the same time, the Dominators' highly classified \"Batch SW6\" escapes captivity.
