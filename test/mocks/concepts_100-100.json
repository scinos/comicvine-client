Luffy</a>, the pirate captain, and his ship Going Merry (later replaced by Thousand Sunny), and his crews of Straw Hat Pirates. This manga is created by <a href=\"/eiichiro-oda/26-55855/\"> Eiichiro Oda</a>. The current rooster of <a href=\"/straw-hat-crew/65-51871/\"> Straw Hat Pirates</a> consists of Nami (the navigator), Roronoa Zoro (an ex pirate hunter who fights with three swords), Sanji (A Cook who fights with his feet), Usopp (A Mechanical Genius and Gunner) Nico Robin (An Archeologist, the only person alive who can read an ancient language), Tony Tony Chopper (an anthromorphic deer), Brook (the cane sword wielding animated skeleton), and Franky (the cyborg carpenter). <br /></p> <p>The devil fruit are powerful items that when there eaten they bestow its powers on the person but it comes at a price. The eater of the fruit can never swim again. Devil fruit are in fact, limited to one fruit per ability or form.&nbsp; It has been suggested that they become extinct if someone eats the last one of a kind, but this is intrue: the fact is is that there is only one fruit per form or ability, and it will only regrow somewhere in the world if that person dies.&nbsp; An example of this is&nbsp;the suke suke no mi, which allows the user to become invisible, Sanji was angry that someone had found and eaten this fruit which had the ability he wanted.&nbsp; So short of murder or accident he would not be able to gain the invisibility power fruit he wanted.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />The fruits can be categorized as such: A Zoan type devil-fruit allows its user to turn into a half-animal, and full animal form, with the ability to mix and match all the features you wish from both forms, though users tend to adopt a singular recognisable form in general. It is said that carnivorous fruit users are particularly brutal. A Logia type devil-fruit allows its user to turn into, generate and control whatever element is associated with that fruit. This is not limited to the standard elements, it can include something as obscure as sand. Finally, there is the Paramecia type. This type of devil-fruit includes that which does not fit into any other category, and tends to give a singular ability which may come with a range of related abilities, such as Luffy's rubber body and stretching, or Buggy's anatomical seperation.<br /></p> <p><br />The following&nbsp;list are people who have consumed devil fruits, and their abilities.</p> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li><a href=\"/smoker/29-49900/\"> Smoker</a> =&nbsp;&nbsp;Moku Moku no Mi, Logia&nbsp;(Smoke) </li><li> <a href=\"/ace/29-47943/\"> Portgas D.

        "description":"<p>The Homunculi are creatures created by using alchemy on the cells of an already living creature and injecting the cells into a human body. This process is made possible through the use of carrier embryos which enter the body and make their way to the brain, where they turn the human they have infected into a Homunculus. If the embryo is implanted directly into the brain, then the transformation will be almost instantaneous and almost painless, but if the embryo were to be injected at any other part of the body, it will cause severe pain to the person as it makes its way up to the brain. After the creature has become a homunculus, they gain many different powers, including invulnerability, healing, immortality, super strength, super speed, and a need to eat humans.</p><p>There are three different types of Homunculus:</p><p>Animal-Type Homunculus:</p><p>=======================</p><p>The Animal-Type Homunculus is the weaker of the two types, resulting when the carrier embryo is implanted with the cells of an animal and implanted into a human. When this happens, the human will be capable of transforming into the form of the animal from which the cells were taken, as well as being able to transform into a human. This transformation is severely harmful to the human host though, causing them to die, and their brain to be taken over by the experiences and instincts of the donor animal. The Animal-Type Homunculi become amazingly loyal to the human that created them, much as a pet becomes loyal to its owner, though some seem to be less loyal than others. Their power is entirely dependent on their animal and on their own will (as demonstrated by Kawazui\u2019s being beaten by <a href=\"/kazuki/29-51727/\">Kazuki</a> Muto, but Washio being able to battle both <a href=\"/kazuki/29-51727/\">Kazuki</a> and Tokiko on equal terms.)</p><p>Plant-Type Homunculus</p><p>=====================</p><p>The Plant-Type Homunculi occur when the cells of a plant are placed into the carrier embryo. The Plant Type Homunculi are very similar to the Animal-Type Homunculi, as both have both a human and a \u201cnatural\u201d form, and both the Animal and Plant-Types\u2019 power is entirely based on their own strength and determination. The Plant-Type Homunculus are also arguably the easiest type of Homunculus to make, as Papillon\u2019s first successful Homunculus was a Plant-Type, but this may also have only been a coincidence.</p><p>Human-Type Homunculus</p><p>=====================</p><p>The Human-Type Homunculi are the most powerful type of Homunculi, due to their ability to use the Kakugane, an ability reserved for humans. The Human-Type Homunculi are created when a Human uses his own cells in the carrier embryo, and he would then implant this embryo into their own body. This causes them to gain all the powers of a Homunculus without their minds being destroyed. In other words, they are able to keep their memories, their thought processes, and their ambitions.</p>",

The people of the Fire Nation have desire and will, and the energy and drive to achieve what they want.\u201d</blockquote><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1930337\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1930337-firebending_super.jpg\" title=\"Firebending\"><img id=\"1930337\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1930337-firebending_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Firebending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Firebending</div></div></div></div><p>The firebenders, hailing from the fire nation, are capable of controlling heat, and are capable of amazing feats of fire manipulation and creation. The first firebenders, the Sun Warriors, were able to discover their abilities by studying the world\u2019s natural fire benders, the dragons. Firebenders have shown themselves capable of using fire from various parts of their bodies, including, the hand, feet, and mouth, but to a rarer extent. Firebending seems to require steady breathing, or else the bender can lose control of their fire. Firebenders have shown shown themselves capable of propelling in the air through use of fire, but in only small bursts, as demonstrated by Azula.</p><p>During Sozin's Comet, firebenders are at their peak. Iroh, by himself, was capable of sending a giant ball of flame to burst a hole in Ba Sing Se's wall. Firebenders ( like Ozai) have themselves to be able to continuously float in the air and propel themselves by using fire coming from their feet. The fire formed by Sozin's comet has a significant reach compared to regular firebending.</p><p>Firebender also have different colors for fires. Traditional fire is red/orange. One exception is Azula's, who's fire is blue ( although it was the traditional color when she was younger.) Her seems to be more concussive as it was capable of busting through a wall of earth created by Aang. Varying colors seem to mean varying strengths.</p><p>The true nature of Firebending was hidden by fire lord Sozin when he began his war against the other nations. He instead began teaching all those under his control that the true power from the fire nation lay in their rage, and began making them angry at the other nations.</p><p>Firebending is based on the martial artist\u2019s style of Northern Shaolin, focusing on strong kicks and long ranged attacks. However, they are also very capable of fighting close range with swift punches and jabs. The true strength of a firebender, though, is in their amazing speed and precision, and prodigal firebenders have been shown to be able to escape from four other capable benders without damage to themselves.</p><p><b>Lightningbending</b></p><p>Lightningbending, also known as the Cold blooded fire, is one of the most deadly</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"328661\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328661-43463-benders_super.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Bending\"><img id=\"328661\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328661-43463-benders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Bending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Bending</div></div></div></div><p>techniques available to a firebender. To bend lightning, a firebender must let go of all of their emotions, and then attempt to separate their good side from their bad side, their yin from their yang. However, due to the fact that the two are connected, they will eventually crash back together, and lightning is created. The Lightning is nearly impossible to survive, but this power is not at the mercy of the user. The user can only guide it out of them, and the lightning shall carve its own path through the air.</p><p>However, it is possible to redirect lightning. The technique for doing so was created by the amazing firebender <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/uncle-iroh/47559\">Iroh</a> as he watched waterbenders. To due so, one must guide the energy that the lightning creates through your hand, down your arm, through your stomach, and then out your other hand, sending the lightning away from you. However, if it were to go through your heart, then it would cause too much damage, making it deadly to the user. This makes this technique impressively deadly, but a true master can do it without fear of harming themselves.</p><h2>Earthbending</h2><p>Iroh\u2019s words of wisdom on the Earth Kingdom:</p><blockquote>\u201dEarth is the element of substance. The people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse and strong.\u201d</blockquote><p>The Story of the earthbenders is the only story that has been explored in detail.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"328257\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328257-137867-benders_super.jpg\" title=\"Earthbending\"><img id=\"328257\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328257-137867-benders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Earthbending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earthbending</div></div></div></div><p>The story is of two warring sides, and two people on each side who discovered one another and fell in love. The two, by observing the badgermoles, learned to earthbend and carved out long elaborate tunnels that connected their two sides, and would meet secretly in the caves.</p><p>Earthbending is based off of the martial arts style of Hung Gar, though the character <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toph/47732\">Toph Bei Fong\u2019s</a> style of earthbending is based off of Southern Praying Mantis style instead. It focus\u2019s on having a strong, solid base that makes it almost impossible to move the earthbender when they are fighting. They are capable of moving unbelievable amounts of earth, making them unbelievably dangerous. Earthbenders have shown they can move through the ground as if it was air, and are more attuned to the air as well. Earthbenders can also bend mud ( since it's earth and water), and sand, but as shown by Toph, it isn't the easiest transition, although she becomes skillful enough in it to create a replica of Ba Sing Se, including some citizens.</p><p><b>Metalbending</b></p><p>Metalbending is a subsection of Earthbending that appears to have been created</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"328687\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328687-131203-benders_super.jpg\" title=\"Discovering Metal bending\"><img id=\"328687\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328687-131203-benders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Discovering Metal bending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Discovering Metal bending</div></div></div></div><p>by the blind Earthbender Toph. Due to metal being a purified form of earth, Toph was able to discover the impurities in the metals by using vibrations. Then, by bending these small impurities, Toph was able to bend the metal, effectively becoming the first ever Metal Bender.</p><p>The fact that it is possible to bend metal is of serious danger to those who attempt to imprison such a metalbender, as it used to be thought that imprisoning an earthbender was to keep them surrounded by something they could not bend, namely metal.</p><p>Though Toph does appear to be the only character capable of metalbending, it is very possible that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-bumi/29-52623/\">King Bumi</a> can actually bend metal, since he was shown bending while in a metal cage. However, his only comment about bending with his face makes this very unlikely. Aang can possibly bend metal in the future, seeing as though he has the same seismic sense Toph has (from training with her) and knows that even metal has some Earth inside it.</p><h2>Airbending</h2><p>Iroh\u2019s words of wisdom on the Air Nomads:</p><blockquote>\u201dThe Air Nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns, and found peace and freedom. Also, they apparently had pretty good senses of humour!\"</blockquote><p>The Airbenders, who lived in a similar fashion as Buddhist Monks, first learned</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"328649\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328649-54908-benders_super.jpg\" title=\"Airbending\"><img id=\"328649\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328649-54908-benders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Airbending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Airbending</div></div></div></div><p>how to manipulate air currents by watching the Sky Bison, as well as the winged Lemurs. Eventually, they became Nomads, and lived in one of four temples spread at the four different directions.</p><p>The Airbending style is based off of the martial arts style of Ba Gua, as well as Hsing Yi. An Airbender usually attempts to avoid al assaults sent their way, and will usually attempt to just wait for an opening in their opponent\u2019s defense. The biggest advantage that they held in a fight was their inhuman speed, caused by their ability to manipulate the air around them. They were also able to summon great gusts, and some were even powerful enough to summon giant hurricanes. Airbenders had the capability to be some of the deadliest benders, due to the abundancy of air, their quick movements, and the capability of creating miniature tornadoes/twisters, funnels, slices of air capable of cutting rock etc. However, sue to their pacifistic nature, they don't do such things.</p><p>Airbenders have a great variety of offensive and defensive techniques, such as creating shields of air, concussive blasts shaped like the bender's body, and so on. Passively, they can run on waer ( because they're so fast) run up walls, and create air cushions to slow themselves down as they're in the air, so they don't the ground hard.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Air Nomads were all killed at the beginning of the war between the Fire Nation and the rest of the world. Only one of them actually survived the attack, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aang/47646\">The Avatar</a></p><p><b>Gliders</b></p><p>Airbenders use hand gliders to fly/glide.

The glider is a stick concealing a two fans sort of things, one big one up top, and a smaller one at the bottom. Traditionally, the Airbender holds onto one of the wooden bars used to hold out the fan, and put their feet on a small bar on the bottom.</p><p>The Mechanist and Teo recently created a new glider for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aang/29-47646/\">Aang</a>. The gliders upper fan was smaller and it contained a bar up either end for Aang to hold onto. It also had a compartment used to store nuts.</p><h2>Waterbending</h2><p>Iroh\u2019s words of wisdom on the Water Tribes:</p><blockquote>\u201dWater is the element of change. The people of the Water Tribe are capable of adapting too many things. They have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything.\u201d</blockquote><p>For centuries, people have watched the tides caused by the slow push and pull of</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1930342\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1930342-waterbending_super.jpg\" title=\"Waterbending\"><img id=\"1930342\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1930342-waterbending_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Waterbending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Waterbending</div></div></div></div><p>the moon. A few people decided to attempt the same feat, and began teaching themselves how to manipulate the water. According to Princess Yue: \"Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves... Our strength comes from the Spirit of the Moon; our life comes from the Spirit of the Ocean. They work together to keep balance.\"</p><p>The style of waterbending is based off of the ancient Asian style of Tai Chi. It encompasses fluid and skillful movements to control the water, and a true master may appear to be in a sort of dance as they fight. They are capable of summoning giant waves, as well as controlling hips of water.</p><p><b>Healing</b></p><p>By using the properties of water, waterbenders are able to manipulate the</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"328657\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328657-140732-benders_super.jpg\" title=\"Healing\"><img id=\"328657\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/328657-140732-benders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Healing\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Healing</div></div></div></div><p>meridians to the point that they can heal multiple wounds, from cuts to burns. This healing has also been shown to help heal mental damage as well, and, with the help from spirit water, it has been shown to be able to bring someone back to life.</p><p>The healing that is taken on by waterbenders was usually taught to the women, who were believed to be useless in a fight, until this practice was stopped by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/katara/29-25622/\">Katara</a>.</p><p><b>Bloodbending</b></p><p>Bloodbending is perhaps the darkest aspect of waterbending. Bloodbending can only be performed on the night of the full moon, when a waterbender is at their peek strength. A waterbender uses their increased power to control the fluids within a person, and cause them to do whatever the waterbender wishes. This can only be resisted by another waterbender.</p><h2>The Avatar</h2><p><strong>EnergyBending</strong></p><p>Energybending is the ability to bend life energy. It predates the main four bending</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1930357\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1930357-aang_energy_bending_580x354_super.png\" title=\"Energybending\"><img id=\"1930357\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1930357-aang_energy_bending_580x354_medium.png\" alt=\"Energybending\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Energybending</div></div></div></div><p>arts, as well as the arrival of the Avatar and the formation of the Four Nations.</p><p>Before the arrival of the Avatar into the world, and the separation of the four elements, people bent the energy within themselves. They discovered the other four bending arts, and over time knowledge of Energybending was almost completely lost. The last known keeper of the art was an ancient Lion Turtle , who later passed it down to Avatar Aang who used it to remove Ozai's firebending forever.</p><p>The capabilities of Energybending are not well understood; what is known is that bending a person's life energy can impart them with knowledge instantly or remove one's bending completely. This bending art is dissimilar to the others because it is so perilous to the user, which is why so few have ever used it.</p><h3>Dangers</h3><p>Energybending is an extremely powerful and potentially dangerous technique. If the bender's spirit is even slightly weak (bendable), then they will be infected by the spirit of the one they are bending. As a result the bender can be corrupted and even killed.</p><h3>Don\u2019t underestimate the avatar</h3><p>The Avatar is a special bender, with the ability to bend every element. It is an Avatar's duty to master each element, and keep peace throughout the world. After an Avatar dies he is reincarnated, circling the four nations, in the circle of water, earth, fire and air.</p><ul><li>In the Avatar State, the Avatars' power is multiplied to an exponential length this usually occurs when the Avatar is in distress or when someone close to that individual is in duress.</li></ul><p>Aang has been shown to be able to take the form of a giant fish monster when he was in this state.</p><p>Also when in this state, the Avatar is extremely vulnerable, which enables an enemy to attack and hurt the Avatar to near death extents.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>What's a Jedi?</h2><p>The Jedi were much like the enforcers of the law, solving crimes, helping in wars and creating peace amongst the planets in different galaxies. The Jedi were very much respected, with the ability to create peace due to their wisdom and patience, and if ever needed, would be able to enforce the law physically thanks to their lightsabers and <a href=\"/the-force/12-50253/\">Force</a> powers. However, due to the Jedi philosophies going against the natural flow of human life, some Jedi had turned to the dark side, and so the <a href=\"/the-sith/65-44460/\">Sith</a> were born. The line between Jedi and Sith (good and bad) were sometimes blurred, as the people thought that the Jedi did not make the best decisions, often leading to conflict and the destruction of planets.</p><h2>Becoming a Jedi and Lifestyle</h2><p>To become a Jedi, one must have a high enough midi-chlorian count and then be discovered by a Jedi Master. How the Jedi Master finds a potential Jedi is usually found by events that the Force creates, due to the Force being in every living form and therefore being connected to each other, no matter how direct or indirect. The Jedi Master will observe the Jedi-to-be and see if they have characteristics that are fit for a Jedi, such as commitment and an astute mind. The Jedi Master would also see if their emotions were in check, seeing as the Jedi thought that emotions such as anger and hate would lead to the dark side. The Jedi Code speaks of openness and no emotion:</p><blockquote><p>There is no emotion; there is peace.<br />There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.<br />There is no passion; there is serenity.<br />There is no chaos; there is harmony. (Added in \"Star Wars: KotOR\")<br />There is no death; there is the Force.</p></blockquote><p>There was also a new Jedi Code after the fall of the Empire:</p><blockquote><p>Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.<br />Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.<br />Jedi respect all life, in any form.<br />Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.<br />Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.</p></blockquote><p>Once a Jedi Master decided that the Jedi-potential person could be accepted in the ranks, their training began. They would start out as with the rank of \"youngling\", usually practicing with a remote, which was a small sphere that hovered just above the trainee's head. It would shoot small lasers that would sting, and the trainee would have to deflect it with their training <a href=\"/lightsaber/18-44097/\">lightsaber</a>, which is a much weaker, non fatal version of a standard lightsaber used with the children as younglings. Once they had gained the rank of a Padawan, they were given the task of building their own lightsaber. They would have to find their own crystal however, and once they did, use their Force training to place and charge the cell. Even something as little as a misplaced crystal could blow up the lightsaber.</p><p>However, the main training of a Jedi was the Force. It is explained that the Force is an energy that runs through everyone. However, the Force in others is more prevalent and therefore can be trained as Jedi. The Jedi Masters always taught them to use the Force for good, such as healing, and if they needed to protect themselves, for defense, and never to be used with anger. Temptation of the dark side was always there, because it always seemed like the easier path to take. Some Jedi Knights would fall to the dark side and realize that they had taken a self-destructive path, but for many, it was too late. The journey back to the light side was difficult after being immersed so far in the Dark Side of the Force. Sometimes Dark Jedi could be saved, though most times it was not possible, and they would need to kill the Dark Jedi as a last resort.</p><p>The way of the Jedi was to help the weak, as opposed to the Sith, where the weak were to serve the strong. Since their lightsaber was such a strong symbol, they were to uphold the best behavior and have a great amount of responsibility. They were to have a clear mind and take care of things that were trivial, and they were required to have an open mind to all things, in order to learn how things work and come up with the best judgement from all they have learned. The Jedi were to wear a tunic and a cloak with a hood, boots and trousers, which were in shades of grey and brown/tan. This was in contrast to the what the Sith wore, which was black, and sometimes red. Due to the Jedi Code, they frowned upon emotions, attachments and materialism. They were to live a life of what seemed to be like poverty even though they had housing, food and clothing. They were never to love or even have sex, though there were certain instances, legal and illegal. One legal example was the Jedi <a href=\"/ki-adi-mundi/29-5422/\">Ki-Adi-Mundi</a>, whose race suffered from low birth rates. From this, he was able to have a polygamous relationship and was a father to many children. An illegal relationship example would be <a href=\"/darth-vader/29-6342/\">Anakin Skywalker</a> and <a href=\"/padme-amidala/29-6343/\">Padme Amidala</a>. This drove Anakin to the dark side and he became Darth Vader, though he was brought back to the light side, thanks to his son Luke.</p><h2>Sects</h2><p>The 3 sects of the Jedi are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/dark-jedi/12-55740/\">Dark Jedi</a></li><li>Potentium</li><li><a href=\"/gray-jedi/12-55739/\">Gray Jedi</a></li></ul><h2>Jedi Rankings</h2><p>The rankings are as follow:</p><ul><li><p>Jedi Youngling</p></li><li><p>Jedi Padawan</p></li><li><p>Jedi Knight</p></li><li><p>Jedi Master</p></li><li><p>Grand Master</p></li></ul><p>More can be found <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jedi-order/41234/&amp;mode=#Jedi%20Ranking\">here</a>.</p><p>A Jedi Youngling would train until the master would decree that he/she would have enough knowledge in the Force to be put up to Padawan. Once a Padawan, they would be taken under the wing of a Jedi Knight; to become a Jedi Master, a Jedi Knight would have to train a Padawan sufficiently until they themselves could become a Jedi Knight. Once a Jedi Knight successfully trains a Padawan, the Knight is to become a Master. Other ways to becoming a Master would be to complete a heroic act. The highest rank was the Grand Master, where they have shown the utmost of wisdom. An example includes <a href=\"/yoda/29-5396/\">Yoda</a>.</p><p>There were also Jedi who had a specialized class if the Jedi Order felt that their skills could be used else where. For example, there were Jedi known to lead armies into war, and Jedi who were interested in politics. There are Jedi classes called the Jedi Guardian, who focused on skills, but had limited use in Force powers, and Jedi Counselors, who specialized in the Force, but had limited fighting skills. There were also Jedi Sentinels who had focused on a balanced practice on the Force and their fighting capabilities. There were also Jedi Healers, and Jedi who took interest in preserving and learning about the culture and history of the Jedi, in hopes of learning past mistakes and improving themselves in the future. There were Jedi investigators, who basically acted as detectives, such as petty arguments to murder cases, and a class, called the Jedi Shadow was to spy on the Sith and expose them in order to prevent any wars between the Jedi and Sith. The Jedi Shadow would obviously have to have a very strong will, in order to fend against the dark side attacks.</p>",

        "description":"<strong>NOTICE</strong> Due to the fact that not all manga characters have been added to Comicvine, some of the examples on this page may be lacking. If you can think of anyone who belongs on this page, please look them up and add them under the acceptable stereotype. If the character is not on the vine, please add him/her and do the same. Also, this page has a HIGH RATE OF SPOILERS, so please, if you are in the process of reading a manga story that you think will be listed on this page, read at your own risk. <p>A lot of people read manga or watch an anime and aren't necessarily \"impressed\" by the storylines or character goals, and there is definitely a reason for that: The authors are using the same type of characters and storylines. The \"Save the World with your friends\" storyline can only be done so many times before people start to notice a connection, and it gets old. On this page, we'll list the biggest and most noticed stereotypes to, hopefully, help any manga authors that run into Comic Vine and actually care about whether or not their manga story is impressive or original. This'll also probably be a good read for some of our manga fans when they need a laugh, so forgive us if we seem \"unofficial\" with this page. Okay then, here we go:</p> <p>Among all of the manga and anime stereotypes, the most common that comes to mind is, no, not the main character who strives to be the best at something, not the \"mysterious\" antihero friend, no, not the main character's amazingly awesome master, and no, not even the little heroine that keeps getting kidnapped by afore mentioned anti hero friend. It's the one recurring story arc that continuously pops up, the one thing you can expect in basically any teen shonen manga, the \"Tournament\" arc. It seems that this arc is famous wherever it goes, as it's an easy way for the writer to get all of the main characters who everyone enjoys reading to fight the other favorites, without any need for an actual reason, just their name being popped up on a screen, and, there we have it, a fight scene. This type of arc is predominant in basically any manga that focuses on fighting, and can be found everywhere, and, sadly enough, this extremely unoriginal arc is also almost always extremely long and \"important\" to the story. Ask any shonen manga fan and they'll always tell you that it's just the author running out of a way to introduce the next \"favorite\" character in the series. </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/53000/52780/84680-manga-stereotypes_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </div><br />The most famous of these is more than likely the Yu Yu Hakusho \"Dark Tournament\" saga, one that lasted as an entire arc. That, or the Chunin Exams tournaments, which made many characters that had never come into contact before in Naruto fight each other, with no real reason, as it was a test to see who was a better ninja, not a better boxer. These \"ninja\" simply shown that a good punch to the face is about as good as a dagger to the neck from behind in life and death situations.<br /> <h2 class=\"head\">Action Manga</h2><br /> <p>The Action Mangas are perhaps the most common anime/manga to exist, and therefore, they are also probably the most stereotypical, hence the making of this page.</p><br /> <p><a></a></p> <h3><span>The Main Character Stereotypes:</span></h3><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><br /><br />The Innocent Main Character</span></em></strong> <p> </p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"341802\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4439/341802-108384-naruto_super.jpg\" title='no Naruto, we don&squot;t \"Believe it\"'><img id=\"341802\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4439/341802-108384-naruto_medium.jpg\" alt='no Naruto, we don&squot;t \"Believe it\"' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">no Naruto, we don&#39;t \"Believe it\"</div></div></div></div><br /><br />Then of course, we always have the \"I'm going to be the best\" main character stereotype, one that simply shows near no emotion at the beginning of the story, like...oh, to name a few...Naruto, Luffy, Yoh, and a ton of other non main stream anime/manga characters, too, but those are the most common for the most part. These stereotypical manga characters always seem to wish to be the best at something for a benefit that is selfish, but that is shown to be perfectly expectable in the series. These character also always appear to be happy go lucky, and do very insane feats that are meant to be shown as humorous. This happy way of looking at life disappears whenever someone they care for is put into danger, to the point that they become dangerous, even to the point that they threaten someone\u2019s life. However, when they battle the person who put their loved one in danger, they almost never follow through on their threat to kill them, usually resulting in the enemy to come back and attempt to kill them again. Also, this stereotype seems to always have some sort of hidden power which is due to someone in their family, and this power always seems to manifest when they are about to be killed, and more usually when their loved one is killed or appears to be killed (See Alter Ego).  <p><strong>List of Innocent Main Character Stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/29-44238/\">Naruto</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/49-18836/\">Naruto</a>: Naruto is perhaps the most well known of this stereotype. He is a ninja hailing from the Konoha village, and he always appears to be cheery, despite his past full of hate. Because he was never noticed as a child (due to a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyuubi/46398\">genocidal demon lurking within his belly button </a>), he wishes to be the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hokage/65-50942/\">Hokage</a>, the greatest Ninja in the village, so that he may be noticed.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goku/29-19765/\">Goku</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dragon-ball/49-7104/\">Dragon Ball</a>: Goku, one of the last survivors from the planet Vegeta, was adopted by a lowly farmer, Gohan, picking him up. He grew up amazingly powerful, but also amazingly kind and innocent. He sets out with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bulma-briefs/29-40729/\">Bulma Briefs</a> in search of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dragon-balls/18-46445/\">Dragon Balls</a>. He is always carrying to his friends and always tries to show mercy to his enemies. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yoh-asakura/29-50694/\">Yoh Asakura</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shaman-king/49-20461/\">Shaman King</a>: Yoh was born into a family of shamans and was trained to help guide the spirits to his afterlife. He always is happy and cheery when this is happening, though, and quickly befriends many of those around him, including his enemies. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luffy/29-47924/\">Luffy</a> from the series One Piece: When he was a small boy, Luffy gained the dream to become the \u201cKing of Pirates,\u201d a fact he never lets anyone forget. He gained this strange dream when he met the legendary pirate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shanks/29-49627/\">Shanks</a>. He then accidentally ate the devil fruit, which gave him the ability to stretch, and seven years later, he sets out on his goal to become a legendary pirate. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aang/29-47646/\">Aang</a> from the series [[Avatar: The Last Airbender:vol:19410]]: Aang was born as the Avatar, the person who is the bridge between all nations and all worlds. He ran away though, and was frozen for 100 years before being rescued by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/katara/29-25622/\">Katara</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sokka/29-47733/\">Sokka</a>. Aang always acts as an immature child, a fact that commonly puts his and other people\u2019s life in danger. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yamato-delgado/29-53642/\">Yamato Delgado</a> from the series Battle B-Daman: Yamato was raised by cats up until the age of five but was then taken in by a restaurant owner named Mae who raised the completely innocent boy as her son. It seemed it was his destiny to possess the legendary B-Daman known as Cobalt Blade, which she tried to keep away from him, but on his eleventh birthday it came to him. He would always go into a fight believing victory inevitable, even when facing some of the mightiest opponents in his universe. And somehow this spirit managed to help him come out on top time and time again as his strength grew exponentially.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/subaru-sumeragi/29-43362/\">Subaru Sumeragi</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tokyo-babylon/49-21031/\">Tokyo Babylon</a>: Subaru was born into the Sumeragi family, a famous family of exorcists who specialized in many different form of exorcism. Like most of the heroes in his stereotype, he is always kind, and always tries to find the good in everyone. Unlike mot of his fellow stereotypes, though, his goal is not so out there, and he only wishes to be a zookeeper. However things would not make it so easy (see Fallen Heroes section for details) </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kenshin/29-45133/\">Kenshin</a></p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/43000/42468/138680-ichigo_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </div><br /> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">The Tough Guy Main Character</span></em></strong></p> <p>This character is the one who never took anything from anyone, and gained a reputation for being a dangerous force on the school yard. They are hated by the teachers for their juvenile ways, and always have horrible grades. Then, the character is thrown into a situation that he still has to muscle his way through, and seems or be ill suited to take on by him/herself. However he unleashes an amazing power that he is granted right when he is in need of it, usually by a young woman (for example, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yusuke-urameshi/29-45374/\">Yusuke Urameshi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/botan/29-46257/\">Botan</a> from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yu-yu-hakusho/49-18948/\">Yu Yu Hakusho</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ichigo/29-42468/\">Ichigo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rukia-kuchiki/29-46355/\">Rukia Kuchiki</a> from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bleach/49-18244/\">Bleach</a>) The main character, after being granted his/her strange and unusual powers, will eventually make friends, and soon becomes a force to be dealt with, despite him starting out as an average high school punk. This character will also usually gain an \u00fcber-powerful master that teaches them discipline, causing them to become even more powerful. Also, for some very strange reason, these characters are commonly given the task of hunting down supernatural beings after dying or doing something that should have resulted in their death, as well as being a sort of police officer. This, however, is not entirely a part of the stereotype, and appears to be more closely related to coincidences when writing the characters. They usually have no Main Bad guy, but more of Main Bad guys in different story arcs. A final main bad guy is established, but not after going through multiple minor Main bad guys in the process.</p> <p><strong>List of Fighting Main Character Stereotypes:<br /></strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ichigo/29-42468/\">Ichigo</a> of the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bleach/49-18244/\">Bleach</a>: Ichigo was just a punk at his high school who could see ghosts, until one day he was attack by a giant hungry ghost called a Hollow that attempted to eat him. He was saved by a young girl, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rukia-kuchiki/46355\">Rukia</a> , who gave him her powers so that he could defend his family. Since that day, he as become one of the most powerful spirit reapers out there.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yusuke-urameshi/29-45374/\">Yusuke Urameshi</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yu-yu-hakusho/49-18948/\">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>: Yusuke was just a punk at his school, until one day, he died saving a young child from a car. He met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/botan/29-46257/\">Botan</a>, and was granted another chance at life. After he came back to life, he become a detective for the spirit agency which <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/botan/29-46257/\">Botan</a> was a part of. After that day, he was pitted against some of the most powerful villains in the spirit world.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kamui-shiro/29-43345/\">Kamui Shiro</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x1999/49-18506/\">X/1999</a>: Though Kamui always knew that he had powers beyond human comprehension, he attempted to avoid his destiny as the key to the apocalypse and became a fighter at his school, fighting all those who oppressed the weak. Unfortunately, he was pulled back into his fate, and he had to fight for the end of humanity itself.</p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">The Mixed Main Character</span></em></strong> </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/49000/48932/122773-sakura_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br /></a> </div><br /> <p>There are some instances of mixing these two kinds of main character stereotypes, resulting in an innocent and </p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"245712\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5029/245712-111018-sakura_super.jpg\" title=\"Oh boy, our guardian.

Again, they are usually granted abnormal powers from a female character and also usually results in them being killed or almost being killed (unless the mixed main character is a girl. They will usually just discover the power for themselves.) The mixed main character will be at first viewed as just a young and non-threatening person, but will always prove themselves as time goes on, even to that one guy who always say that they can\u2019t do it. <p><strong>List of Mixed Main Character Stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kazuki/29-51727/\">Kazuki</a> from the series Buso Renkin: Kazuki was a simple high school kid who liked to goof off and never thought before he acted, however, this led to his death when he got in between a girl and a raging <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/homunculus/12-51803/\">Homunculus</a>. The girl, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tokiko/29-51804/\">Tokiko</a>, turned out to be magical, and she brought him back to life using a mystical item. He would later become one of the most powerful alchemists to date.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/light-yagami/29-48703/\">Light Yagami</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/death-note/49-20261/\">Death Note</a>: Light was just your typical super genius high school student until the day that he saw from his classroom window a book falling. This book, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/death-note/18-52041/\">Death Note</a>, gave him the power to kill whoever\u2019s name was written in it. That day, he began killing criminals as the mysterious Kira. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sakura/29-48932/\">Sakura</a> from the series Cardcaptors Sakura: Originally a simple school girl, Sakura\u2019s life would forever change when she one day came across a book holding within it multiple cards. When she touched them, though, the cards flew away, and she was told by a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/keroberos/51464\">a small floating plushie</a> that she had to collect all of the cards again.

He lost everything when Kamui chose his path, and he gained power beyond imagine, though becoming evil.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sora/29-44471/\">Sora</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lelouch/29-50976/\">Lelouch</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Anti-Hero:</p> <p>==============</p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/41000/40722/29060-vegeta_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </div><br /> <p>The Anti-Hero is a staple in almost every Shonen known to man kind. The Anti-Hero is one whose life is riddled with memories of a dark and tragic past (usually caused from the Evil Brother/Father character talked about below.) The Anti-hero then grows into an angered youth, and their view of right and wrong has become blurred. Usually, revenge or some sort of other external drive causes them to become partially evil. This could eventually lead to them becoming a Fallen Hero (see Below), but this is a rare occurrence. The Anti-Heroes usually have their past at the front of their mind, resulting in them to come across as a large amount of teenage Angst, and if this angst is shown two much, the character can commonly be labeled as Emo by fans of the series. These characters usually start out as a bad guy and though they become good, they still are a rival of the main character. Anti-Heroes are usually featured in stories focusing on an Innocent Main Character, providing a contrast between the two (though appearance in a series with a fighting protagonist is also commonly used, but just not as commonly.) The Anti-Hero is always originally at odds with the main character, but will eventually become friends with him. Whether this friendship will last or not is up to the writers, but eventually, the Anti-Hero will become the Heroes true friend by the end of the series.</p> <p><strong>List of Anti-Hero Stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sasuke/29-44241/\">Sasuke</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/49-18836/\">Naruto</a>: Sasuke became a dark and unstable child after <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/itachi/44260\">his brother</a> killed his entire family. Sasuke then became driven by his need for revenge, but his resolve began to slip after he met <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/29-44238/\">Naruto</a>, who he eventually grew to see as his best friend. This would eventually change, though (see Fallen Heroes Section for details)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vegeta/29-40722/\">Vegeta</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dragon-ball/49-7104/\">Dragon Ball</a>: Vegeta started out the series as a villain, but after getting his butt handed to him by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goku/19765\">a certain hero</a>, he turned the other cheek and joined there side. Through the entire series, his main goal is to better then [[Goku:char:19765], and at many times his dark traits got in the way of saving the day.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hiei/29-45368/\">Hiei</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yu-yu-hakusho/49-18948/\">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>: Hiei started out the series as a villain, but became a reluctant hero after he was defeated. Through the series, he grows to be one of the main good guys, though he always keeps the dark aspect that defines him.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hao/29-50793/\">Hao</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shaman-king/49-20461/\">Shaman King</a>: Hao is one of the main villains of a series who can be classified as working towards a good cause.

The Sidekick is usually looked down upon by the other protagonists, and there for, they are forced to prove themselves multiple times. They usually become great friends with the main character, even though they originally started out on rocky terms. Throughout the story, the Sidekick will most likely be kidnapped, and due to the friendship between them and the Main Character, the Main Character will become obsessed with getting them back. The Sidekick may also have the ability to do some feats deemed impossible, but his moments of glory are usually overshadowed by the feats of the Main Character.</p> <p><strong>List of Fighting Sidekick Stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kazuma-kuwabara/29-46086/\">Kazuma Kuwabara</a> from the series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yu-yu-hakusho/49-18948/\">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>: Kuwabara was always counted as the second most dangerous person on school campus, and was only beaten by Yusuke Urameshi, a fact that he took to heart. Even after he became a spirit detective along with Urameshi, he was always overshadowed by Yusuke\u2019s achievements. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sokka/29-47733/\">Sokka</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chao-zu/29-19773/\">Chao-Zu from the series dragonball is a tiny little person who was tiens sidekick (many thaght they were outloud and proud).

This is one of the few stereotypes NOT employed in the Naruto franchise (unless you count some of the summons), although it has been found in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bleach/49-18244/\">Bleach</a>, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Buso Renkin. The Innocent Sidekick is one who very rarely has any powers what so ever, a fact which is commonly used against the main character, in which he is forced to save his average Joe friend. The Innocent Sidekick also rarely is aware of the main character\u2019s amazing abilities, but learns through time that they are a true powerhouse. This is not always the case though, as the sidekick may be aware of the main character\u2019s prowess from when they first appear. Sometime, the writer of the Anime decides to kill off the Innocent sidekick, and the story then begins to take on one of the darkest turns in the series.

However, these characters commonly are the <em>exact same</em> type of person, and always seem to act to similar, a trait that can take away from the enjoyment of reading a manga. </p> <p>There are two types of the perverts, those who are there to teach the main characters an extremely important lesson and/or technique, and those who seem to always follow around the character for some odd reason. These two characters always have one glowing trait, they seem to have no dignity or pride, and will flirt with </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45470/9705-miroku_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </div><br /> <p>any girl that they see. This always leads to rejection in one form or another, from having the girl slap them across the cheek to learning that the girl was only a ploy to distract them. Despite their questionable activities, though, the perverted character is always very powerful, and helps the main character on multiple occasions, and will become one of the biggest friends to the main character, whether as a teacher or as a traveling companion. The main character grows to depend on their power, and also comes to friendly terms with their kind yet straightforward attitude. Also, the girl who the pervert mainly associates with will almost always gain an affection (and maybe love) for the pervert, despite the fact that he does multiple sexually harassing things to her on a daily basis. </p> <p><strong>List of the Pervert Stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jiraiya/29-44511/\">Jiraiya</a>:Don't even joke about not knowing why this guy is a perv, please.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/master-roshi/29-53244/\">Master Roshi</a>: Of course, Master Roshi was the original master pervert, when it came to getting Bulma Briefs to flash him or simply staring at dirty magazines, he stayed perverted for the duration of the Dragonball/Z series.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miroku/29-45470/\">Miroku</a>: The monk from Inuyasha, he always asked for Sango, wait, no, what are we thinking, any woman he met if they would have his children.

The character is almost always a character who had been introduced before, usually as being dead, and who hides their after their \u201cdeath\u201d or disappearance. Hint after hint are dropped for the character X stereotype\u2019s real identity that it becomes less of a mystery of their identity and more of a mystery why the main character can\u2019t realize it. Eventually, the identity of the main character is finally revealed, much to the main characters shock. The X-Characters are also known to come out of nowhere to save the hero at the last minute, say a few words of encouragement, and then leave the same way he appeared. This usually increases their fan-base greatly, but at the same time, it becomes slightly repetitive, and can lead to a very predictable plot.</p> <p><strong>List of Character X Stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/racer-x/29-43341/\">Racer X</a> (one of the classics)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tobi/29-45000/\">Tobi</a> (A case of being mislead into thinking he is another character.)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/haku/29-44244/\">Haku</a> (he was actually the boy in the mask, unbeknownst to Naruto)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/riku/29-45370/\">Riku</a> (when he wore the Organization XIII hood)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tuxedo-mask/29-50670/\">Tuxedo Mask</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prince-zuko/47634\">The Blue Spirit</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p><br /><a href=\"/skull-man/29-55071/\">Skull Man</a><br /><br />The Fallen Hero</p> <p>===============</p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45370/94010-riku_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </div><br /> <p>The Fallen Hero is one of the less known stereotypes in the Manga world, but it is still present, and therefore will be appearing on this page. The Fallen Hero is one who was originally a kind and caring fighter and person with morals seen as heroic, but, after a hardship in their life, they became a dark and evil force, and one of the main obstacles to the main characters. The Fallen Hero is always extraordinarily powerful, and commonly kills people close to the main character. Usually, their past is shown in a long, chapter long flashback that provides the question of why they became evil, and will later have an equally long chapter detailing how they became evil, and when they tell their story to the main character, they attempt to bring the main character onto their side, and though it seems to effect the main character, they never switch sides. The Fallen Hero will then attack him in a famous battle. The Fallen Hero has either two different possibilities, they will either die in after being forgiven by the main character, or they will become a friend at the end. </p> <p><strong>List of the fallen hero stereotypes:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/riku/29-45370/\">Riku</a>:Sora's best friend who fell to darkness attempting to save the remaining part of the Destiny Island's trio, Kairi.

The influential deceased character always leaves a lasting impression on those around him or her, and never does the author EVER let you forget their influence. Usually, they always sacrifice their life for a great cause that is utterly selfless, and that sends the main character into the adventure they are experiencing. Also, regardless of what happens in the story, the influential deceased will always remain dead, though they may appear as ghosts or in dreams. When they do appear in such a manner, it is always to deliver a speech that makes the main character follow their path and become a true hero.</p> <p><strong>List of the Influential Deceased stereotype:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yondaime/29-45927/\">Yondaime</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toru-shiro/29-43361/\">Toru Shiro</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avatar-roku/29-52564/\">Avatar Roku</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hokuto-sumeragi/29-43372/\">Hokuto Sumeragi</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amidamaru/29-51120/\">Amidamaru</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Evil Older Sibling</p> <p>======================</p> <p>Now, here's one that's almost always present in any anime or manga, the main or sidekick's older sibling. </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/48000/47768/68453-princess-azula_400.JPG\" rel=\"nofollow\"></a> </div><br />Most people see these as \"invincible\", and the older brother characters are always extremely powerful, in fact more so a prodigy than the main character after them. They are nearly always \"renegades\" and/or wanderers in the universes they live in. In most of these situations, the older brother's younger sibling is either striving to become better than them, or to kill them, like Sasuke wanting to slay Itachi for killing his entire clan. These big brother figures are nearly never there to support said younger sibling in times of need, and are often the source of the younger sibling's hatred. They are never good examples to said younger siblings as they make \"mistakes\" or commit horrible <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/itachi/44260/#The Clan Slaying\">crimes</a> that cause their siblings to hate them. However, in the end, these characters tend to come back and prove how they were such good people in actuality, by finding out that they actually attempted or did save them, to their surprise and disbelief.  <p><strong>List of the Evil Older Sibling Stereotype:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sesshomaru/29-45469/\">Sesshomaru</a>: Come on guys, everyone knows our favorite white wolf demon.

They usually tell the main character what to do, and, despite the fact that the main character is usually a hard-head about certain things, they will eventually do what they are told. The bossy girl is also commonly used as a love interest for the main character, though this is not always the case, and in many cases it is left up to the reader to decide. The bossy character is always a gamble for authors though, as a reader will usually either like them or be seriously annoyed by them, and it is usually the latter. This is due to the fact that they are always obsessed with two things, the first one being interchangeable, and the second being beating up the main character. This kind of personality brings the character across as one sided, and it is very hard to actually add depth to the character. However, by the end of the story, you'll enjoy seeing these hardy females go at it with their male partners, as they are often the only comedic part of the series left.</p> <p><strong>List of the Bossy Girlfriend Stereotype:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asuka-soryu/29-49802/\">Asuka Soryu</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/misty/29-53326/\">Misty</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chi-chi/29-40807/\">Chi Chi</a> from the dragonball/z/gt series. she was always bossy telling goku to stop fighting and gohan to do his homework<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sakura/29-44242/\">Sakura</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ino/29-44248/\">Ino</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anna/29-53483/\">Anna</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/keiko-yukimura/29-46290/\">Keiko Yukimura</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Mascot</p> <p>==========</p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/53000/52213/24213-pikachu_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/53000/52213/24213-pikachu_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>You saw it coming</strong> </div><br />The Mascot is a character who is only there for the point of having a cute animal to show people knew to the series. Usually, they are shown in a comedic light, though sometimes they do their share of angst, but rarely with it being shown as amazingly serious. Mascots are often used in marketing material, but are always worked in to be a vital part of the plot, despite the fact that it could easily be changed to not include a cute and fluffy animal.

The magical girl is usually a young, beautiful girl who gives the main character of one of the main characters amazing magical powers. The Magical girl rarely ever does anything else except for tell the main character something about the power that should have been mentioned from the beginning. This makes them a common annoyance to the reader most of the time.

This is a common stereotype for manga involving Mechas, and almost always appears in some way or form, usually as the main character. This can kind of draw away from the believability of the series, and can turn away many fans in an instant. The Instant prodigy also always seems to be a teenager who shouldn\u2019t even be slightly aware of how to fight.

Their obsession grows to the point that they would give up anything for the character they are obsessed with, and this is VERY hard to make believable, especially since the character they love usually treats them like crap. However, there are obviously some characters that have been shown as believable with this stereotype.

Strangely, the Right Hand man commonly is more powerful then the main bad guy, but despite their obvious power advantage, they still serve the main bad guy unwaveringly.

They originally come across as just being happy/sad/weird; however, they are always shown to be much more in depth, which is later revealed through a series of flashbacks or long speeches given by the emotionless character.</p> <p><strong>List of the Emotionless Character Stereotype:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rei-ayanami/29-49801/\">Rei Ayanami</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sojiro/29-51182/\">Sojiro</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sai/29-44246/\">Sai</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p><br /><a href=\"/ms-sunday/29-51714/\">Nico Robin</a><br /><br /><a href=\"/ulquiorra-schiffer/29-51716/\">Ulquiorra Schiffer</a><br /><br />The Anthropomorphic Character</p> <p>=============================</p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45469/25115-sesshomaru_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/46000/45469/25115-sesshomaru_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>Yes, he is in fact a Giant man-eating demon Dog</strong>&nbsp;</div><br /> <p>The Anthropomorphic Character is a character who displays both the traits of a human and the traits of another animal. This includes characters who were originally an animal but took on human form, a human that took on animal form, or just a mix of something. These characters usually look almost exclusively human, except for ears, a tail, or both being visible on them. Some characters don\u2019t even have animal ears, but appear to have animal ears, and are therefore considered anthropomorphic.</p> <p>One of the most common anthropomorphic combinations is the female cat-girl.

These characters almost always act as dark, mysterious, and motionless, keeping an air of danger around them. These characters, if provoked, will destroy whoever they are up against in a manner similar to a pathetic death. Commonly,&nbsp;one of the main character's goals in life is to become better then this best-of-the-best person, and will be deeated by them at least once. however, they never give up on their battle, and will always somehow achieve their goal.<br /><br /><strong>List of the Most Powerful Stereotype:<br /></strong><br /><span><span>Hawkeye Mihawk</span><br /><br /><a href=\"/the-third-hokage/29-44513/\">The Third Hokage</a><br /><br /><span>Yondaime</span><br /></span><br />The Moe Character<br /><br /> <p>Vegeta</p><p><br /><a href=\"/teresa/29-55901/\">Teresa</a><br /><br />=================</p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/51000/50482/179208-sailor-moon_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/51000/50482/179208-sailor-moon_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>Sailor Moon, almost the Definition of Moe\u2026</strong> </div><br /> <p>Do not be fooled by the name. This is not referring to Moe (M\u014d) but Moe (M\u014d-\u0101). In other words, this refers to a sexually stimulating character. The Female Fan-Service Character is a must have for almost any manga series directed at a male audience. These characters are always shown with large and well exposed chests, a thin waste, and are always viewed sexually by the boys in the series. It is a very common occurrence for the Moe character to be groped and manhandled, only for them to 1. Cry in a very girly voice or 2. Beat the living daylights out of the person groping them. Also, Moe are commonly shown in costumes that elicit a fetish (ie. A nurse costume, a maid costume, sailor costumes with super short skirts, etc.) or are referred to as one of these fetishes. Some series also seem to be entirely created on the Moe characters. Strangely, though, the Moe characters commonly seem to have a positive reaction from male fan.

This other version of the character is always insanely powerful, but also amoral to the point that they can\u2019t even be trusted to use their power justly (this includes having a spirit live within you as long as it can take control of the body to an extent.) The Alter ego appears when the character most needs it: when they are about to lose to a much more powerful opponent (A friend dying or appearing to die is also common.) The main character will then battle this old threat that had them beat second before, and will defeat them without the trouble they had experienced before. Although this appears very useful at first though, the character is then faced with the trouble of keeping this evil personality in check, though the character will eventually conquer this threat and be able to use the alter ego\u2019s power without fear of losing themselves.<br /> <p><strong><br />Examples of the Alter Ego Stereotype:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/naruto/44238\"><br />Kyuubi Naruto</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ichigo/42468\"><br />Hollow Ichigo</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jio/52954\"><br />Satan Jio</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/seras-victoria/45136\"><br />Vampire Seras Victoria</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inuyasha/45371\"><br />Demon Inuyasha</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yusuke-urameshi/45374\"><br />Demon Yusuke</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurama/45993\"><br />Yoko Kurama</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gaara/44258\"><br />Shukaku Gaara</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avatar/47646\"><br />Avatar State Aang</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p><br />THE STEREOTYPE COUNT</p> <p>====================</p>Which series has the most manga stereotypes for action characters?

Some of these deaths are pointless, like the pathetic deaths section below, as it only shows us tht the writer could come up with no reason to really make the character in the first place. However, these due make some dark comedic moments for readers, as many of these deaths are hilarious. Then, there are the tear jerking ones that really kill you to watch, as you generally know that said character is going to die, and said character happens to be one of your favorites. Also, it would seem that under no circumstances, under any reason, should a character be able to die a normal death, such as a heart attack or old age. If so, there must be a certain or special reason why this said character had to die this way.</p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Pathetic Deaths</span></em></strong></p> <p>Throughout every action manga, there is nearly always a death scene that was unnecessary for the series to progress, often just to show a new character's \"power\" by instantly killing a/ many lackeys or side characters with no importance to the story. </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/53000/52780/139122-manga-stereotypes_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/53000/52780/139122-manga-stereotypes_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>Owned</strong> </div><br />These characters are almost always antagonistic to the main character for some period of time, and only kill these people as an entrance for what seems to be a sheer lack of creativity for an introduction. The deaths of these lackeys are almost done in less than a second or off screen, proving the \"power\" that this new character/characters have compared to the main character. This action can happen in basically anywhere in the storyline, but it seems it is almost entirely necessary for it to cameo, in any manga that involves fighting.  <p><strong>List of the Pathetic Deaths:</strong> </p>note, this is a list of characters that have killed characters off insanely quickly, not the characters killed, as these nearly never play any role in the story or have a name<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scar/29-49319/\">Scar</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrath/29-50262/\">Wrath</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gaara/29-44258/\">Gaara</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zabuza/29-44261/\">Zabuza</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/itachi/29-44260/\">Itachi</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aoshi-shinomori/45360\">Aoshi</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saito/29-51201/\">Saito</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vegeta/29-40722/\">Vegeta</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toguro-ototo/46049\">Toguro</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hiei/29-45368/\">Hiei</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurama/29-45993/\">Kurama</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/light-yagami/29-48703/\">Light Yagami</a> <br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ryuk/29-52039/\">Ryuk</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alucard/29-44583/\">Alucard</a><br /><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><br />Drawn Out Character Deaths</span></em></strong><br /><br />Then, of course, there are the characters that have extremely long, drawn out deaths. These are usually very sad, foreshadowed, and painful, as can be determined by the way the character lived their life, like, say, Itachi from Naruto, or Zabuza, of the same series. <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/45000/44260/29050-itachi_400.JPG\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/45000/44260/29050-itachi_150.JPG\" /></a><br /><strong>Possibly the saddest character death yet in Naruto... </strong></div><br /><br />These characters deaths generally bring out the good in them, or at least shed light on how they really took life, ie when Itachi, rather than attempting to rip out Sasuke's eyes once again, poked him in the forehead, transferring all of his Sharingan techniques into him to keep him alive. Or Zabuza's infamous charge through all of Gato's minions. These deaths happen quite often, generally when you know the character is about to die, like, say, Shishio. However, his death was not necessarily one of a protagonist or revealing of the light within him, if there was any. Main villains of series always have extremely large, drawn out deaths, especially when represented in video games, where they seem to take up several minutes to simply fade off screen. Maes Hughes, of Fullmetal Alchemist, had a death scene that was extremely sad, killing him off in a phone booth, and Light Yagami from Death Note also had a death of this stereotype, making what was actually a minute's countdown to a heart attack seem like an hour, screaming for help in the corridors of his mind.<br /><strong><br />List of Drawn out Deaths for Characters</strong>:<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/itachi/29-44260/\">Itachi</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zabuza/29-44261/\">Zabuza</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gato/29-44966/\">Gato</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gaara/29-44258/\">Gaara</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jiraiya/29-44511/\">Jiraiya</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/light-yagami/29-48703/\">Light Yagami</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maes-hughes/29-50742/\">Maes Hughes</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/greed/50305\">The first Greed</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kotori-mono/29-43358/\">Kotori Mono</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-third-hokage/29-44513/\">The Third Hokage</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/piccolo/29-40727/\">Piccolo</a>(only to be resurrected)<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shishio/29-51136/\">Shishio</a><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><br /><br />Final&nbsp;Victory Deaths<br /><br /></span></em></strong>This refers to the final death of a character referred to as the main antagonist. This death is almost always seen, since the bad guy never wins. However, there are some cases where the Main bad guy reforms at the end of the series, and in this case, they will either live or have a drawn out character death. The Final victory death is usually the most climactic point of the series, with the hero, despite being beaten, battered, and 95% dead, is able to gain his true victory over the main bad guy and finally kill him. The main character will then somehow heal from his nearly fatal wounds and celebrate with his friends, and the main bad guy will always just be a bad guy. This stereotype has been employed the most by the series Dragon Ball Z.<br /><br /><strong>List of Final Victory Deaths:<br /><br /></strong>NOTICE: This list also includes defeats of characters who, despite not dying, are never seen again, and almost never referred to again. <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shishio/29-51136/\"><br />Shishio</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freeza/29-40737/\">Freeza</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cell/29-40806/\">Cell</a><br /><br />Buu<br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arlong/29-49766/\">Arlong</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/don-krieg/29-49901/\">Don-Krieg</a><br /><br /><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sir-crocodile/29-48022/\">Sir Crocodile</a><br /><br /><a href=\"/irene/29-55905/\">Irene</a></p> <p><a></a></p> <p>Manga Weaponry</p> <p>==============</p> <p>Even more so than death, a manga/anime has to have weapons, it's just essential.

But we do know that every character from the dog walking down the street to the old grandpa who sits in the cafe with his tea has a weapon, maybe not a fearful one, but a weapon none the less. Here's a list of the most used: </p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Swords</span></em></strong><br />Okay guys, there is no manga without one of these. There just isn't, it has to defy some law. In nearly every manga there is a blade, and plenty of characters use them. </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/49000/48075/139130-masamune_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/49000/48075/139130-masamune_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>The Masamune...a sword famous to gamers everywhere...</strong> </div><br />These blades can list from anything short of a simple katana or a legendary sword with building splitting properties. the characters that use these weapons can have such diverse characteristics to their moral values and character that it's impossible to call them a stereotype, but maybe a little diversity of weapons would be nice. One thing is for sure though, is that if a character has a sword, they can almost never be injured by a bullet or any other weapon but a sword...unless of course the character they are fighting is their master.  <p><strong>List of Sword Using character Stereotypes</strong>:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kenshin/29-45133/\">Kenshin</a> Himura, the most famous manga main character with a blade.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sanosuke-sagara/29-46676/\">Sanosuke Sagara</a> Sagara, while he didnt use a sword for very long, he certainly used it well.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/saito/29-51201/\">Saito</a> Hajime, one of Kenshin's bitter rivals to the end, though a good friend in the long run.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yahiko/29-51200/\">Yahiko</a> became a second Kenshin, so of course he had a blade of his own.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kaoru/29-51199/\">Kaoru</a> was a practitioner of the Kamiya Kasshin ryu, and was also the teacher of her sword school.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aoshi-shinomori/45360/\">Aoshi</a> Shinomori was the leader of the Oniwabanshu, and made good use of his blades in battle.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jine/29-51197/\">Jin'e</a> was an amazing sword fighter and Kenshin's rival, the only one to defeat Kenshin in battle throughout the entire series.

The gun will then be utterly useless, never being able to hit the main character, or when they actually succeed in hitting the character, they are utterly unable to hit then in a vital area. However, there is then the possibility that the main character has the gun, and in these instances, the main character is able to hit a fly five hundred feet away tied up with both of their eyes closed and with five hundred people in the way. A gun is only portrayed as \"useful\" in manga when held by one of the major characters. If used by some random enemy, the shots A.) Never connect, not once, not twice, out of one thousand shots; or B.) Directly hit the target multiple times and not do an ounce of damage to it.</p> <p>Manga Hair Color</p> <p>================</p> <p>The Hair color of a Manga Character has been shown to be a deciding factor in the personality and power of a manga character. This has appeared in almost every media where the characters can summon a great burst of Energy.</p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Silver/White</span></em></strong></p> <p>Whenever a character has either silver or white hair, there are oly two possibilities, they are either amazing powerhouses, or the are old. Let us begin with the insane power houses. Though these characters always appear to be just simple and never start out seemingly powerful, they are still capable of doing attacks assaults and all that of nearly godly perportions. For instance, if they originally appeared to be slow characters not being able to dodge something that appears to be amazingly easy to dodge, they later are able to move faster then the naked eye is able to see. However, if the characters are amazingly old, then they are either a main character or a side character that does nothing. If they are of the former, though, then they are still able to beat other characters early 100 years younger then them with ease, and be able to still do feats of inhuman perportions. </p> <p><strong>List of Characters with White/Silver Hair:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kakashi/29-44243/\">Kakashi</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kaworu-nagisa/29-49821/\">Kaworu Nagisa</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jiraiya/29-44511/\">Jiraiya</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amidamaru/29-51120/\">Amidamaru</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kabuto/29-44523/\">Kabuto</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kimimaro/29-44262/\">Kimimaro</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurama/29-45993/\">Kurama</a> (when in Yoko Kurama Form)</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sephiroth/29-44472/\">Sephiroth</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/riku/29-45370/\">Riku</a></p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \"><br /><a href=\"/clare/29-55531/\">Clare</a><br /><br />Red</span></em></strong></p> <p>Most of the characters with red hair are commonly hotheaded and commonly are some of the first to jump into a fight. Also, they always seem to have some sort of romantic attachment to someone, though whether this is about being obsessed with someone or just being a womanizers varies, however.&nbsp;Red headed characters are commonly in the fighting stereotypes (either fighting sidekick or fighting main characters). This hair color stereotype, though, is not nearly as common as the silver/white hair stereotype.<br /><br /><strong>List of characters with redish hair:</strong></p> <p><a></a></p> <p><br /><span><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kazuma-kuwabara/29-46086/\">Kuwabara</a></span><br /><br />Manga Blood Types</p> <p>=================</p> <p>The blood type of the characters in Manga is a deciding factor in their personality traits. The blood types of these characters is recorded in the the A/B/O scale.</p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Blood Type O</span></em></strong></p> <p>The characters who are born with the O blood type are characters who have traits where they are sociable and always get along well with others. They are also shown to be both agreeable with what others say, and are also the people who look at the glass as half full, as opposed to half empty. However, these characters are also commonly very vain, thinking only of what will best benefit them, and, do to there carefree nature, they can also be very care<em>less</em>. another strange negative trait for these kind of characters is that they can be very ruthless. </p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Blood Type A</span></em></strong></p> <p>The characters who have an A type blood are very earnest about others, showing their caring and nkind nature to all those around them (though they can sometimes be a bit to earnest). These characters are also creative, coming up with many different plans on the spur of the moment. They are also capable of being very calm and sensible in different times and areas, allowing them to be very analytical of there surroundings and of multiple different possiblities. However, they can be overly detailed in there plans, and can be very compulsive in doing their plans in the <em>EXACT</em> way that they planned.</p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Blood Type B</span></em></strong> </p> <p>The Character with a blood type B are very wild about there lives, enjoying what the do, and they do do a lot. these characters are always doing what they set there mind to, and can not be stopped from doing what they want to do. These characters are also always seen with a smile on there face, enjoying what they do immensly. However, doing what they do, these characters can be very selfish, only trying to do what they want, as well as being irresponsible in there attempts at completeing there goal. Also, they are commonly very ignorant of the ways of the world around them.</p> <p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration:underline; \">Blood Type AB</span></em></strong></p> <p>A character with this specific blood type is commonly controlled and rational in his/her thought process. They are almost always unphased by the horrible things that they see, and almost always have the exact same expression, regardless of the situation which they are currently in. However, this rationla thought process can make them appear very cold, alienating them from their peers. These characters are also very indecisive, usually when their emotions are involved, as well as very critical of their peers.</p> <p><a></a></p> <h2 class=\"head\">Laws of Manga Physics</h2><br /> <p>For anyone who has ever read or heard of manga has discovered the one total and godly rule for all manga, the laws of Physics are absolutely useless. Therefore, The Manga Laws physics, a list detailing the physical possibilities commonly found in Manga, was created. These Different physical possibilities are commonly found within Manga, and have been used so many times that they have now fallen to the point of a stereotype.</p> <p>please note that all the theorys listed in this section are meant to be satirical, and are by no means <em>actual</em> explanations for the concepts listed</p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Big Head</p> <p>============</p><strong>In times of anger, Manga characters are able to manipulate the size and shape of their head.</strong> <br /> <p><br />Characters in Manga are capable of increasing the size of their head. This ability only seems to manifest, though, when the character who displays this power experiences a large amount of anger at one person in particular. Their head then grows to a size larger then their body, and they will scream angrily at the person they are angry at.</p> <p>A variant of this law is that the characters face will change shape, their teeth will begin to show gaps, their pupils disappear, and their mouth widens incredibly, giving them a cartoonish look. Also, when they are not at the anger level that they shout at the person, a vain shall appear on their head, and shall bulge menacingly for a few seconds. This vein usually appears when a character beats their comrade down for doing something stupid.</p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Magical Yell</p> <p>================</p><strong>The voice of a character or their loved ones is able to increase the power of said character</strong> <p><br />Characters in Manga, whenever they appear to transform, almost always let out a long and anguished yell. The cause of this is unknown, but it has been speculated that it is caused by excruciating pain caused from the power-up, or by the amazing pleasure caused by said power-up. Either way, this yell always seems to be optional, as later transformations will have this scream absent. </p> <p>In a similar fashion, whenever a character has been almost killed, the scream from a loved one is some how able to both heal the wounds to the point that they no longer plague the character and increase their power to the point that they can obliterate the enemy who they are facing. </p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Fourth Dimension</p> <p>====================</p><strong>Characters in Manga have discovered the ability to store different items in another dimension and to someone these items at will</strong> <p><br />The Fourth Dimension has come to be one of the most used powers in Manga. This power is usually always held by the female of the group, and she becomes capable of summoning large weapons and such from this strange rift. However, this power never seems to be used in battle situations (many believe that this is because the immense aura of evil that the enemy puts off interferes with the dimensional manipulation of the character.)</p> <p>Common Items that are stored in the Fourth dimension are Mallets, Bazookas, and baseball bats. All of these also appear to be unable to cause serious injury to the person hit with them (theorized to be do to weakening of the atoms resulting from the dimensional shift.) As fellow fans of manga, we like to dub this unknown area (generally behind the female characters back) \"Malletspace\", as in multiple manga series it is shown that these characters have access to hammers behind their backs....hmmmm.</p> <p><a></a></p> <p>The Hair Style</p> <p>==============</p><strong>The hair of a character is able to take on any color or shape, regardless of how impossible</strong> <p><br />The Hairstyle held by characters is one of the most distinct features of Manga. </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/47000/46524/68186-yu-gi-oh_400.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/47000/46524/68186-yu-gi-oh_150.jpg\" /></a><br /><strong>Need we say more?</strong> </div><br />The hair is able to take on any shape that is wished by the owner of the hair. Also, even without the use of hair products, the hair of the character is capable of standing literally straight up, and can take up the color of any wished shade, from black to white. The style of the characters hair is even able to change shape and color with a thought, a most well seen in the famous Manga series Dragon Ball Z. Then of course, characters seem to be born with blue, green, or purple hair. Nothing special about it, and an albino seems pretty normal in any anime/manga world, just as often as you find a brunette.  <p><a></a></p> <p><br /><br /><br />Indestructible Hair</p> <p>===================</p><strong>All hair can not be destroyed by means of guns, energy, or fire. The only thing capable of destroying hair is a blade</strong> <br /> <p><br />Whenever a character is caught in a large explosion, shot in the head, or blasted by energy (which, in retrospect, would kill them anyways), their clothes are left in tatters, their body id bloody and battered, but their hair still keeps shape and style, and is never destroyed in these occurrences. So far, the only possible way to destroy the hair of a manga character is to have them narrowly dodge the attack. Their hair always seems to cut for dramatic emphasis, yet is strangely never shown any shorter after being cut. </p> <p>Also, it has been commonly noted that the power of a character seems to be dependent on their hair length, and when they become stronger, their hair length seems to grow. This is often sited as the reason for the invulnerability of hair, as it is a defense mechanism to control the character\u2019s power.</p> <p><a></a></p> <h3>Main Character Physics</h3> <strong>The main character in an anime is always going to live through a fight, or be brought back after said fight</strong> <p><br />Basically, any main character that happens to get into a skirmish and get cut, can not die from poison or blood loss. It simply seems to be physically impossible, as mentioned before in the deaths section, to be killed by something normal. Should debris from a crumbling building fall on a main character, they can not die from it, ever, unless of course they come back to life within minutes (in which case you can hardly call it dying). They also are able to defy the laws of physics at any moment during their fight, without ever being shown to do so before. Also, it would seem that a main character equipped with a blade is able to defeat any manner of opponent, and, if they happen to have a charging motion towards you, and there's a sudden flashback/splitscreen/flash of light, and they end up behind you, you have immediately lost the fight, it would seem.</p> <p><a></a></p> <h3>Fighting Sequences</h3> <strong>During a fight, a character is able to display stamina that is not present at any other time</strong> <p><br />Throughout any and all shonen action manga, there is always a fight scene. In fact, we can't dare think of a series that would go without one, even in the direst of circumstances. There are tons and tons of fight scenes in manga and anime, but none are more memorable than the main character vs. his rival, or the battle that has been built upon for the entire series, ie The Sasuke/Itachi fight or the Goku/Vegeta fights. There are always the fight scenes that require little to no effort to see who's going to win, but most of these are listed under \"Pathetic Deaths\". In manga, the fight scenes are always filled with epic moments, and generally last much, much longer than a fight between any normal human would have. We'd list the stereotype count here, but let's face it guys, you can't name a single character that doesn't have an action sequence in shonen manga.</p> <p><a></a></p> <h3>Introductory Scenes</h3> <strong>Every time that someone is introduced into a series, they usually are able to instantaneously defeat an enemy, proving they do have some power.</strong> <p><br />Now, every manga character has to have an introduction,right? Well, of course they do, otherwise they aren't a character in the series. Well, this isn't exactly a stereotype that can be avoided, but some of these intros are used way too much, like the instantaneous death entrance. </p> <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49256/99616-l_400.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/50000/49256/99616-l_150.png\" /></a><br /><strong>Yes he is O_O</strong> </div><br />There are some good ways to introduce new characters that aren't done ever so often, though, like Death Note's L. All he did was say his name, but he made sure to be just as cool as any other manga anime character out there while doing it. Most main characters are introduced in a rather indifferent way, making them very boring to watch. Come on guys...Kenshin did it, not everyone else has to too...(when we say this, we are referring to the typical \"One Hit KO\" intro on the first antagonist of the series).  <h3>Four</h3> <strong>The number four, when mentioned, always has mystical proportions</strong>.<br /><em><br />Okay, how does a demon become a Saint? I'm lost here</em> <br /><br />-Yusuke Urameshi, Yuyu Hakusho <div><a href=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/47000/46045/16673-suzaku_400.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/item/47000/46045/16673-suzaku_150.png\" /></a><br /><strong>Suzaku, the Leader of the Four Saint Beasts</strong> </div><br /><br />Okay, so it is just a number, but it's still represented in manga a lot...well, maybe far too much. There are almost always a group of four characters in a single group that the main characters have to fight, every single series that I personally can account for. these characters are usually mirror opposites of the characters in the main characters group, as there are usually four in this too, counting the heroine five, but of course the writers decide that she will never participate in a major battle. The most notable and memorable of these would have to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-four-saint-beasts/65-46046/\">The Four Saint Beasts</a> of Yuyu Hakusho. It was Yusuke's (the main character) first battle where he could have actually died, and his friends (Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara) fought one of the members each, winning all of their battles. Of course, they were left behind and had to \"stop the enemies from getting in\" so yusuke could have his one on one match with their leader, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/suzaku/29-46045/\">Suzaku</a>. Similar things happen in manga with characters like this, the leader can never be taken down like he should be, treated as a true threat to humanity, but only by the main character himself<br /><br /><a></a><br /><br /><h3>Singular Fight</h3><br /><br /><br /><strong>Whenever a character begins a fight with someone else, they will be the only ones able to fight said person, despite any friends being there</strong><br /><br />This law appears to be related to the \"four\" law stated before. Whenever a group of characters come to fight a super-strong main bad guy, they will always split up, one person fighting one of the enemies they encounter, leaving a clear path for the main character to run through to new enemies, even though it would be ten times quicker if all of them were to just gang up and defeat the enemy. However, when a five on one fight does occur, it is almost always against a villain who <em>can</em> fight five enemies on equal grounds (commonly referred to as Power-Rangers Syndrome).<br /><br /><h3>Death Powerups</h3><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Whenever there is the death of a protagonist in a series, it always seems to strengthen the main protagonist. If it is the Main protagonist who dies, they then always become much more powerful and come back to life.<br /><br /></strong>Related to the Magical yell stereotype. This law states that death is in fact one of the most useful things in the series, as it will always seem to strengthen someone (usually the main protagonist.) Though this would usually be attributed to an increased resolve to take revenge, the sheer magnitude of this power increase is much more then could normally be constituted by an increased resolve. One theory attributed to this is that when a character dies, they open up a dimensional rift to the afterlife, and the power resonating from the afterlife is then enfused with the character, increasing their power. This theory also seems to give a reason for the second half of this stereotype, an increase of power after death. Since the character is directl exposed to the power in the afterlife, they are able to absorb more, and therefore become total powerhouses<br /><br /><h3>Plot Devices<br /></h3><br />Throughout manga there are many instances in which something should have happened, but didn't, due to the characters role in the story, and often times no real explanation at all, and no reason to happen, say, the female hero running into the most dangerous character in the series, or one of the more dangerous ones, for no real reason, and being held captive by them, or \"escaping\", simply with the help of plot. This is extremely prevalent in many series. such as Orihime Inoue being captured by Ulquiorra Schiffer of Bleach, or Kairi being taken hostage by Sai'X of Kingdom Hearts. Among many plot devices, there is always a way to surpass the \"ultimate\". What we mean by this, is no matter what something is said to be the most powerful form or attack (ie, Super Saiyan), it will always be surpassed if addressed by the main character. Once something is said to be impossible, it is always surpassed and not even viewed as useful by the end of the series, among many of these being the Bankai of Bleach, the \"Hyper Gundam\" of G Gundam or any type of hyper transformations.<br />",

In some cases, many team members even fight amongst themselves for no real good reason.</p><p>*<b>Death has hardly any real power in comics</b>: No matter how long or how brutal a character's death, they can brought back to life by either faking their deaths, magic, time-travel, and even broken reality.

This is usually a turn-off for many fans, seeing the favorites heroes becoming something totally different that they're known for, but there are some who accept these changes as character evolution.

Her new power is the ability to turn her body into near-indestructable diamond, but this power blocks her telepathy.</p><p><a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\"> Black Tom Cassidy</a> - Gained the power of clorokinesis (he turned into and was able to control all plant life).  He lost this power when <a href=\"/m-day/12-41003/\"> M-Day</a> struck.</p><p><a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\"> Iceman</a> - Iceman's secondary mutation was directly linked to his first: his body was completely turned to ice, and he wasn't able to change back and forth between human and ice form.  In this form, if he was destroyed he was basically immortal because he was able to reform himself from water.  He lost this power due to M-Day.</p><p><a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\"> Beast</a> - Beast has some sort of secondary mutation, that seems to keep evolving.  His beast form evolves into something new.</p><p><a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\"> Jean Grey</a> - Somehow, Jean Grey's secondary mutation allowed her original power of telekinesis to return.</p><p><a href=\"/angel/29-2112/\"> Angel</a> - Angel recently developed the power to heal others with his blood, providing they're the same blood-type. &nbsp;He may have always had this mutation but didn't realize it, because <a href=\"/icarus/29-9739/\"> Icarus</a>, a mutant with similar powers, had healing powers that derived from his wings.</p><p><a href=\"/warpath/29-2158/\"> Warpath</a> - Warpath developed the power of self-propelled flight, although for some reason it has never been stated officially that this was a second mutation.  This hasn't been exhibited in a while, but he did display some sort of ability to either jump far or fly again recently.</p><p><a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\"> Polaris</a> - After her powers were drained by her alleged half-sister,  <a href=\"/zaladane/29-21948/\"> Zaladane</a>, Polaris developed the ability of super-strength, but she generated negative emotions while doing this.

Caused by the meeting of Adam and one of his <a href=\"/angels/65-54255/\">Angels</a>, the resulting explosion of energy would then revert all of Humanity into a sea of LCL, the basic state of their soul. All of this LCL is then mixed together, resulting in all of the Human Race being linked through their thoughts, ideas, and being. Therefore, at the cost of all individual existance, the world would be eliminated of all conflicts, all arguements, and all diverging opinions. </p><h2>Origins</h2><p>The Human Instrumentality Project was first ever mentioned in the Lost Chapter of the Human Instrumentality Project in the possession of SEELE. The Scrolls told of the two coming catastrophes, the first summoning the <a href=\"/angels/65-54255/\">Angels</a>, and the second bringing about Instrumentality, the next stage of evolution for humanity. </p><p>The warning in the Dead Sea Scrolls was ignored, though, until a giant creature fitting the Sea Scrolls description of the angels was found in Antarctica. In an attempt to excavate the angel, an explosion resulted, and  the first of the two catastrophes mentioned in the Scrolls came to be. </p><p>SEELE, realizing that the scrolls were in fact telling the truth, created the GEHRIN Organization, later known as <a href=\"/nerv/65-49805/\">NERV</a>, to stop the angels from reaching the original angel found in Antarctica. To do so would then cause the Third Impact, and all of the planet would have been eliminated. </p><p>However, the Sea Scrolls also told of another possible Third Impact, one which would benefit humanity. This other project, the destruction of all of the angels, was also given to NERV, and SEELE then began creating knew defense Systems, The Evangelions.</p>",

She learned this when they were in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> and the group of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> students (consisting of Pixie, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blindfold/29-40597/\">Blindfold</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loa/29-40672/\">Loa</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolf-cub/29-40640/\">Wolf Cub</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rockslide/29-40456/\">Rockslide</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/match/29-40674/\">Match</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anole/29-40458/\">Anole</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gentle/29-41124/\">Gentle</a>) needed to get to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/belasco/29-10947/\">Belasco</a>'s castle to get to their friends.</p><p>After the formation of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/souldagger/18-55653/\">Souldagger</a>, and after Rockslide (newly <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superpowers/12-49870/\">reformed</a>) forced Darkchilde to tell them how to get to their other friends, she explains that Pixie can teleport the group there. The part of Pixie's soul that was used to form the Souldagger was replaced with Dark magic. At first, Pixie had a hard time grasping the ability. Darkchilde grew slightly impatient with Pixie as she was having a difficult time learning the spell. She would often pronounce \"Chinoth\" as \"chunoth\" due to the difficulty of the language, or her welsh Accent. Pixie notices Darkchilde's frustration with her and exclaims, \"This isn't even English! And there's a lot of words!! And you're mean!\"</p><p>According to Darkchilde, Pixie should be able to cast the spell without saying the words. Also, for some unknown reason but most probably meditation, Pixie was floating upside down, and was being held by an unknown pink energy, probably formed by Darkchilde. It is unknown what the approximate mass/the or approximate amount of people she is able to teleport with the spell. but she has been seen teleporting at least ten people with ease. The range of spell is also unknown, but she has been able to teleport from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Weschester</a> to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a>, and from The Transamerica Pyramids to the Golden Gate Bridge in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a>.</p><h2>Use</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"418466\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/418466-16173-ms-marvel_400_super.jpg\" title=\"One of her first attempts\"><img id=\"418466\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/418466-16173-ms-marvel_400_medium.jpg\" alt=\"One of her first attempts\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">One of her first attempts</div></div></div></div><p>Pixie now uses the spell regularly, as she does her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/souldagger/18-55653/\">Souldagger</a>, during combat, normally as a method of escaping. She has used it to: get to Belasco's castle, escape a base of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/purifiers/65-14915/\">Purifiers</a>, get to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a> and escape a collapsing mine, at all times taking people with her. In Infernus #1 Pixie and <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> had a race from the Transamerica Pyramid's to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.</p><p>When Nightcrawler arrived, Pixie was sitting on the bridge waiting for him. To his disbelief, Pixie revealed that she made the trip in one \"Jump.\" The trip took Nightcrawler more than one so he challenged her to another race home. They were to go from the Golden Gate Bridge, to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">X-mansion</a>. Without Giving Pixie any further warning, Nightcrawler, \"Bamfs\" out of sight. Pixie takes a minute to fan the smoke Nightcrawler leaves behind before chasing after him. Even with his head start, he still couldn't beat Pixie to the danger room. Recently when Pixie used her Teleporting spell, there was no pink aura about her. Whether this was artist error or a new development is unknown at this time.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Different Levels </h2>\n<p>In <i>Dragon Ball Z</i>, the possibility of a power greater than that of a Super Saiyan is first theorized in the episode \" Laboratory Basement\", when Krillin and Future Trunks contemplate how Vegeta plans on retaining his dominance in power among the Z Fighters. The first of these new heights in power is the Ascended Super Saiyan stage obtained by Vegeta, Future Trunks and later, Goku. This technique (as well as the Ultra Super Saiyan technique that follows) is essentially a method of enhancing the abilities of a Super Saiyan, rather than a complete departure from it in favor of newer and more unique power. It is not until the Cell Games that this uncharted level of power makes its debut, in the form of Super Saiyan 2. Saiyan characters continue pushing their limits during the series, ultimately discovering a third, and in anime incarnations, fourth level of Super Saiyan. Two exclusive Super Saiyan stages are also featured in the <i>Dragon Ball</i> films. There are nine variations of the Super Saiyan in all. The following is a summarized list of the premature and advanced levels of the Super Saiyan transformation. </p>\n<ul class=\"plain-list\">\n<li>False Super Saiyan, a pseudo-Super Saiyan form resembling a glorified <i>Kaio-ken</i>, with a yellowish surge of aura. Appeared in <i>Lord Slug</i>. \n</li><li>Ascended Super Saiyan, an advancement in the power of the original Super Saiyan state. \n</li><li>Ultra Super Saiyan, an even stronger advancement in the power of the original Super Saiyan state. \n</li><li>Full-Power Super Saiyan, the state of mental and physical perfection of the Super Saiyan transformation itself, rather than an advanced stage. \n</li><li>Super Saiyan 2, the second Super Saiyan transformation. \n</li><li>Legendary Super Saiyan, a level of Super Saiyan which magnifies its user's strength capacity, without drawbacks. Only one Saiyan capable of assuming the transformation is said to be born every thousand years. Appeared in <i>Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan</i>. \n</li><li>Super Saiyan 3, the third (and final in the manga) Super Saiyan transformation. \n</li><li>Super Saiyan 4, the last, quintessential Super Saiyan transformation. Appeared in <i>Dragon Ball GT</i>.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></li></ul>\n<h2>Dragonball Z</h2>\n<h3>False Super Sayian</h3> In this form, Goku's irises and pupils are no longer visible, mostly in turn to the power and bleak rage. His body bulks up a little, his hair straightens like that of a Super Saiyan, his skin color also appears to have a yellow hue to it, but there is no considerable change in feature other than a red tint to his hair. He gains a yellowish surge of aura, somewhat but not quite resembling that of a normal Super Saiyan's. In turn, the form somewhat resembles a glorified Kaio-ken form, but there are notable differences.<p>When he transformed into the true Super Saiyan transformation during the fight against Frieza, Goku witnessed the murder of Krillin (as well as the fact that Krillin isn't likely to be revived with the Dragon Balls, as Shenron had already granted that wish and could not resurrect the same person twice), something that drove him over the edge. This ultimate pain was not fully present during the fight against Slug, which is most likely why Goku did not transform fully. The form of False Super Saiyan was shown to be very erratic, lasting for only as long as the aura is ignited, and using up much more energy to sustain than the full Super Saiyan. </p><br /><h3>Super Saiyan</h3> This is the first stage of the legendary Super Saiyan. Not every one is able to reach this level. The original Super Saiyans are unknown and after millenia, it became a legend. Every Saiyan warrior trained to one day become a Super Saiyan, although none knew how to achieve it.<br />\n<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goku/29-19765/\"> Goku </a>was the first to become a Super Saiyan in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freeza/29-40737/\"> Freiza </a>saga. When Freiza killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/krillin/29-45683/\"> Krillin</a>, then Goku got out of control and reached this level. Goku was the first to reach this level in over a thousand years. Technically, the next Super Saiyan was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trunks/29-40747/\"> Trunks</a>, but he attended the level in the future of an alternate timeline. The next Saiyan to reach this level was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vegeta/29-40722/\"> Vegeta</a>, who had believed the transformation was his royal birthright. <br /></p>\n<p>The next Super Saiyan was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gohan/29-40743/\"> Gohan</a>, who was the youngest at the time to achieve the transformation at the age of 11. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goten/29-40745/\"> Goten </a>and Trunks were also to tranform at an even younger age.<br /><br /></p>\n<h3>Ascended Super Saiyan</h3> There are 2 types of Ascended Super Saiyan. The first was originally discovered by Vegeta and Trunks while in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber, where power was increased exponentially, but it took from their speed. Goku managed to perfect this transformation, but with more speed and less power than the original. Both Vegeta and Goku knew that this transformation was simply a slight power-up and not the next plateau.<br /><br />\n<p>\n</p><h3>Super Saiyan 2</h3> This stage is more powerful then Super Saiyan. Super Saiyan 2 is stronger in speed and strength then all previous tranformations. Gohan was the first to achieve this level, shortly after first achieving Super Saiyan. When he was fighting against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cell/29-40806/\"> Perfect Cell</a> he got out of control but soon realized how to use the power properly. Lightning forms around your body. You don\u2019t lose speed. Everything increases. Goku and Vegeta also attained this level.<br /><br />\n<p>\n</p><h3>Super Saiyan 3</h3> Super Saiyan 3 is very powerful stage but cannot be maintained for a long time. Your eyebrows disappear. Your hair falls down past your knees and muscles are buffed. First time achieved by Goku. No one else achieved it besides Trunks and Goten when they fused together as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gotenks/29-51122/\"> Gotenks</a>. Just staying in this form drains your energy until eventually the power leaves the Saiyan and makes them exhausted. This level was described by Goku as only being suitable for Other World.<br />\n<p>\n</p><h2>Non-Canon</h2>\n<p>\n</p><h3>Super Saiyan 4</h3> This is the final form of the Super Saiyan. You can only see this form in Dragonball GT. Super Saiyan 4 can only be achieved by Goku and Vegeta. The only way to become a Super Saiyan 4 is to become a golden Oozaru.&nbsp; Goku become a Super Saiyan 4 by his power and the training he does. But Vegeta used something called the brute waves that Bulma made. That helped him become a Super Saiyan 4. You hair color goes back to normal. A red fur coat grows across your chest. But Gogeta had brown fur and red hair. All of your stats increase and you can maintain that form for a long time.<br /><br /><h3>Legendary Super Saiyan</h3> Legendary Super Saiyan is a Saiyan born once every thousand years and is usually either hailed a savior or a destroyer. The only person shown as a legendary Super Saiyan was Broly, although flashbacks to the original Saiyan home planet hint at an even more powerful Legendary Super Saiyan having lost control and destroying the world, along with himself in the process. A Legendary Super Saiyan is unique from other Saiyan transformations in that the Super Saiyan in question grows to enormous sizes and has hair that glows an electric lime green. The eyes also become white with \"blind rage\" (although whether this means that the legend in question is blind or appears to be blind can be debated). Also, the strength level grows every second the user is in Legendary Super Saiyan mode, being forced to pulse out waves of energy to keep themselves from erupting.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />So far, in the case of Broly, the last of the Legendary Super Saiyans \nthus discovered, the tails have been docked to prevent him from \ntransforming into a golden great ape. It is unknown if others of his \nkind had the same procedure done, or if the power levels are diminished \nslightly as a result of the tail being amputated. <br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2355385\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/12/122549/2355385-broly_boom.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0Broly, the Legendary Super Saiyan about to release an Omega Blaster energy ball. \"><img id=\"2355385\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/12/122549/2355385-broly_boom_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0Broly, the Legendary Super Saiyan about to release an Omega Blaster energy ball. \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0Broly, the Legendary Super Saiyan about to release an Omega Blaster energy ball. </div></div></div></div>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Born at the beginning of the universe, with the first act of willpower, Ion is a cosmic entity. One the seven entities personifying the Emotional Spectrum, it is the living embodiment of the willpower in the universe. It is a passive creature, living in symbiosis with it's host as opposed to the parasitic relationship some of the other <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emotional-embodiments/12-55823/\">Emotional Embodiments</a> employ.</p><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians of the Universe</a> were made aware of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emotional-spectrum/12-49955/\">Emotional Spectrum</a>, they would be drawn to the willpower found at it's center. Seeking to put an end to the destruction caused by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/parallax/29-41293/\">Parallax</a>, the Guardians captured the fear entity. They also captured Ion, knowing that it possessed enough power to change the course of the very universe itself.</p><p>Both were placed in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/central-power-battery/18-55704/\">Central Power Battery</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oa/34-41360/\">Oa</a>, while Parallax would become responsible for the yellow impurity in the rings, Ion only lent them power. There it would stay for untold millennium, until the Guardians decided to incarcerate the rogue <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern/12-41148/\">Green Lantern</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro/29-10448/\">Sinestro</a> in the Battery, as well. In the course of his plan to set free Parallax, he also freed Ion as well, thought it's potential would remain untapped until much later.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><h4>First Contact</h4><p>The first known host of the Ion entity was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kyle-rayner/29-40431/\">Kyle Rayner</a>, following the death of Kyle's girlfriend at the hands of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/major-force/29-6941/\">Major Force</a>. Kyle then destroys the hate within him and releases the villain <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oblivion/29-2496/\">Oblivion</a>, who Kyle defeats. Then result of this is that when he left the sun to search for Hal's body, the energy he absorbed attracted the Ion entity to him, and he was also bestowed it's powers, as well as tapping into the Corps' powers. Kyle then takes the identity of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ion/29-46185/\">Ion</a>. He then revives the deceased Guardians and recharges the Central Power Battery. Kyle then loses his Ion powers after restoring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jade/29-3406/\">Jade</a>'s powers.</p><h4>Ion Once More</h4><p>Kyle then retrieves his Ion powers after Jade's death during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rann-thanagar-holy-war/39-55754/\">Rann/Thanagar War</a>. Upon her death, she gifted him with the remainder of her power, allowing the Guardians to place the entity in him once more. Kyle accepts the role of Torch Bearer for the Green Lantern Corps. Kyle then leaves Earth to find his future in space after a series of events.</p><h4><b>Sinestro Corps War</b></h4><p>The existence of the Ion entity wasn't revealed until the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps-war/39-50650/\">Sinestro Corps war</a>. Captured on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/qward/34-41619/\">Qward</a>, Kyle was surprised when Sinestro stripped him of the entity. Hoping to use it to better understand life, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anti-monitor/29-12165/\">Anti-Monitor</a> attempted to study it by running a succession of tests. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lost-lanterns/65-50652/\">Lost Lanterns</a> would arrive to free Ion, though it cost them their leader <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kehaan/29-46401/\">Ke'hann</a> in the process. Gathering the rest of their forces, they returned to Oa with the Ion entity in tow.</p><h4>A New Host</h4><p>Upon reaching Oa, Ion was returned to the Guardians. Though they wanted more time to prepare themselves, the assault on the Multiverse by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-heralds-of-the-anti-monitor/65-56346/\">Anti-Monitor's Heralds</a> forced their hand. They looked through their Corps for suitable candidates, feeling that Kyle Rayner had become tainted by his time in Parallax's thrall.</p><p>Though they considered others, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arisia/29-2046/\">Arisia</a>, they settled on young Daxamite Lantern, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ion/29-46185/\">Sodam Yat</a>, who was prophesied to be the \"Greatest of All Green Lanterns.\" Teleporting to Earth with Ion in tow, the Guardians stopped the Anti-Monitor from attacking, then merged Yat with the Ion entity, infusing him with power.</p><h4>Emerald Eclipse</h4><ul>After the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps-war/39-50650/\">Sinestro Corps War</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daxam/34-42416/\">Daxam</a> was taken over by the tyrant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mongul/29-12162/\">Mongul</a>. While trying to free Daxam from Mongul's grip, Sodam was trying to liberate his race from slavery on the Sinestro Corps. Sodam decided he had to battle Mongul, but was denied the power to tap into Ion by the corrupt guardian, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scar/29-56693/\">Scar</a>. As a last desperate act, Sodam decided he had to take his ring off so he can access the ion power, and fly into Daxam's sun, turning it yellow and empowering his race enough to rebel against Mongul and his legion.<br /><h4>Brightest Day</h4>Now being trapped in Daxam's sun, Sodam Yat was visited by the same enemy that kidnapped parallax. The Enemy reaped Sodam of Ion, which caused the sun to turn red again and for all of the Daxamites to lose their powers. Now the enemy has six entities that he seeks.</ul>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2>Organized crime broadly describes the concept of crime carried out by a unified group of criminals acting concertedly towards a goal, generally the accumulation of wealth and power. Organized crime can operate at the local, national, or international level, and examples of organized crime have existed throughout history and in most cultures. The earliest examples of organized crime include the Thugs of <a href=\"/india/34-55919/\">India</a>, as well as pirates and highwaymen or bandits who plagued early <a href=\"/europe/34-56099/\">Europe</a>, all of whom operated on a far less sophisticated level than the current incarnations of organized crime. What is currently understood to be \"organized crime\" is typically believed to have arisen in the late nineteenth century with the rise to prominence of the Sicilian Mafia in <a href=\"/italy/34-55920/\">Italy</a>&nbsp;and the Triads in <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/34-55795/\">China</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Illegal activities carried out by organizations vary across time and culture. In mid-twentieth century America, for instance, organized crime was mainly involved in the subversion of prohibition legislation, while modern Latin American organizations are involved mainly in drug trafficking.&nbsp;Modern organizations typically have some level of involvement in the trafficking of arms, drugs and other illegal or controlled products, prostitution, coercion and extortion, counterfeiting, fraud, theft, racketeering, corruption and embezzlement, among numerous other activities. Organizations also frequently employ&nbsp;hitmen who carry out anything from the honour killings typical in the highly tradition-based yakuza, to assassinations, to the elimination of competition and informants.&nbsp;Often, organizations are structured around a family-style hierarchy framework, with members recruited from within actual family units with ties to the organization, as well as outsiders who are inducted into the pseudo-family.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Organized crime is distinct from <a href=\"/terrorism/12-55686/\">terrorism</a> in motivation- terrorists are ideologically or politically motivated, while organized crime is profit-driven. It is distinct from most, but not all, <a href=\"/street-gangs/65-30590/\">street gangs</a>, in the level of discipline and the complexity of crimes committed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />There are a wide variety of types of organized crime portrayed in the media. The four criminal organization most often portrayed are:<br /><h3>The Mafia&nbsp;</h3><a href=\"/mafia/65-57321/\">The Mafia</a> is among the most commonly portrayed of all criminal organizations, especially in American crime fiction, due to the dominance of Italian American crime families. Generally, the mafia is portrayed as placing heavy emphasis on loyalty to the family and honour. Typically in media the mafia refers to Italian or Italian American crime families, however, the term can be applied to basically any crime family in any country, with the name of the country or region appended to the word mafia, such as the <a href=\"/russia/34-55706/\">Russian</a> Mafia or the <a href=\"/mexico/34-55820/\">Mexican</a> Mafia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>The Mob</h3>Similarly to the mafia, the generic term \"mob\" tends to be used to refer to any criminal organization not otherwise covered by more culturally specific terms. The first organization to use this name was the Irish Mob, which originated among the immigrant Irish population in the United States, and has or had operations in <a href=\"/australia/34-55838/\">Australia</a>, <a href=\"/canada/34-55868/\">Canada</a>, the <a href=\"/england/34-55794/\">United Kingdom</a> and, unsurprisingly, <a href=\"/ireland/34-55907/\">Ireland</a>. They are fairly prominent in American media, especially in cities, such as <a href=\"/boston-massachusetts/34-56311/\">Boston</a>, <a href=\"/chicago-illinois/34-55728/\">Chicago</a> and <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a>, where there has been a traditionally high level of Irish immigration.&nbsp;<br /><h3>The Yakuza&nbsp;</h3>The crime syndicates in <a href=\"/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a>, the <a href=\"/yakuza/65-56173/\">yakuza</a> are noted for their exceptionally strict codes of conduct and preoccupation with the concept of honour and loyalty. They are organized around a familial structure that encourages loyalty, with the head of the family being called the \"oyabun\", literally meaning \"foster parent\" The yakuza operates both within Japan and around the world; their presence is most powerfully felt in Japan, but they also have a noticeable presence in the United States, Mexico and <a href=\"/north-korea/34-55807/\">North Korea</a>.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Triads and the Tongs&nbsp;</h3>A Chinese criminal organization that is one of the largest in the world, with over 2.5 million members around the world, mainly in China and countries with large Chinese immigrant populations, such as the United States, Canada, the UK and Australia. Triads are similar to, but distinct from, the Tongs, which are similarly Chinese-centric and often actively emulate Triads, but do not necessarily engage in criminal activities (though most do) and were formed as social groups of Chinese immigrants.",

        "description":"<h2>The Metagene</h2> <p>The Metagene is what creates and denotes a&nbsp;difference&nbsp;between human and Metahuman. &nbsp;This gene has been found by multiple aliens groups, which some of them feared the human&nbsp;potential. &nbsp;The aliens found that some human beings had a DNA&nbsp;difference which they named&nbsp;the meta-gene (also spelled \"metagene\"). &nbsp;Normally&nbsp;this gene was dormant in most humans, but sometimes in a persons life whether due to&nbsp;psychological, or&nbsp;physiological stress the gene would activate resulting in a entire genetic change causing the metahuman abilities. </p> <p>In more recent years it has been seen that even certain people are born with the metagene active, even if neither parent had any \"super-powers\". &nbsp;A great example is to look at some of the new recruits in the JSA such as<a href=\"/cyclone/29-31964/\"> Cyclone</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"/tommy-bronson/29-42806/\">Wildcat II.</a></p> <p>The aliens believe the activator of the gene was near the brain but they were not&nbsp;specific. &nbsp;</p> <p> </p><h3> <u><br /></u></h3><h3>White Martians</h3>One of the alien races that saw the genetic potential for humans was the<a href=\"/white-martians/65-11285/\"> White Martians.</a> &nbsp;After discovering the possibility of a metagene in humans the the White Martians performed experiments on &nbsp;primitive humans. &nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;this changed the desitny of the human race because instead of the gene being developed over&nbsp;millennia so every human would&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;posses the gene only a percentage of humans would be able to develop the gene. &nbsp;The White Martians that caused this&nbsp;atrocity&nbsp;were banned to a prison&nbsp;very&nbsp;similar to the&nbsp;phantom&nbsp;zone. &nbsp;While this research was being developed though the White Martians invent a Meatvirus which was a process that allowed a metagene to be passed from person to person just be touching. &nbsp;This process is what gave the people who have called themselves <a href=\"/son-of-vulcan/29-30891/\">Son of Vulcan</a> their powers.<a rel=\"nofollow\"></a>&nbsp;<br /><br /><h3>Population</h3> The phrase Metahuman generally applies to all people and aliens with super powers in the DC universe which makes the population of Metahumans a bit&nbsp;debatable if people want just Metagene Metahumans. &nbsp;According to <a href=\"/countdown-to-infinite-crisis/39-40800/\">Countdown to Infinite Crisis</a>, there are roughly 1.3 million metahumans on Earth, however out of that&nbsp;number&nbsp;only &nbsp;.5% are considered dangerous or threats. &nbsp;Most Justice League members are generally considered Alpha threats and second string heros are considered beta threats which are a little lower. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<h2>&nbsp;Exo-gene</h2> <p>Due to the fact that the gene was supposed to be active for all humans, some humans felt that they should be able to create their own metahumans. &nbsp;<a href=\"/lex-luthor/29-41952/\">Lex Luthor</a> was one of these type of people, he and his company created a toxic mutagen called the Exogene which was supposed to mimic the effects that the original metagene was able to produce. &nbsp;For a normal human to get their powers though they had to go through gene therapy at<a href=\"/lexcorp/65-51472/\"> LexCorp</a>. &nbsp;The first people to go through this process were part of Luthor's Everyman Project. &nbsp;As this process was not&nbsp;natural&nbsp;there was&nbsp;controversy, on top of the fact that a lot of the people who underwent the process became unstable. &nbsp;Luthor made sure when the process was devised that he would have a way to stop &nbsp;these people or control them, this caused a couple \"accidental\" deaths.<br /><br /></p><a rel=\"nofollow\"></a> <h2>Homo Magi</h2> <p>Not all Metahumans get there powers from the metagene, some humans have inherent ability to utilize magic. &nbsp;These particular humans seem to be part of a different branch in the evolutionary tree called &nbsp;''Homo magi\". &nbsp;Now the \"Homo Magi\" can mate and breed with normal humans and have no distinct qualities other than magic use.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /></p><h2>Other MetaHuman Orgins&nbsp;</h2>As almost all super hero

        "description":"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No other fiction genre comes close to comic books when it comes to the concept of canon. The first reason is that most comic books, a 70  year genre,&nbsp; come on a monthly basis and can continue indefinitely. This raises many temporal problems in canon: Is Lois Lane actually over seventy years old? Did Captain America really fight Nazis during World War Two? <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And over time, a character can go through different changes and have different writers. As anyone who has followed a character for a length of time would know, this poses problems, especially since quality or vision of the character may vary, and sometimes the plots can become&nbsp; so bad or so outrageous, people sometimes ignore a story in regards to canon. It could just be a technical issue like a character before could lift only 500 pounds, but in the latest issue, they're lifting something heavier than that. Was it an oversight? Will it be revealed later why that character has more strength?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, in comic books, there is some consistency and coherency expected within that comic universe. This is a problem in comics: take Batman for instance, he stars in multiple ongoing and limited titles, and can guest star in various other titles. All these have different writers with different ideas. Batman is also problematic because he's been in superhero titles like JLA, yet stars in more mundane detective stories. Also, as with Wolverine, people ask \"how does he find the time to star in all his titles and do all those guest shots?\" Some aspects of \"reality\" are ignored when it comes to canon, especially time aspects.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Another relatively unique feature of comics is that they re-re-re...tell origin stories. In each retelling, they can add or take away details which can contradict previous tellings. They can even give a fresh new origin without mention of the previous origin stories, and the reader has to infer that the latest origin story is the \"correct\" one.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; A problem also lies, within the concept of canon itself, that is people have to agree what is canon, and there can always be differing opinions on what is canon or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;",
        "deck":"Basically, canon, in regards to comic books,  is what is considered to be \"real,\" \"what really happened\" or \"what that character is really like\" as opposed to events, etc., that happened in comic books, but nobody \"counts it\" as being \"real\" or \"actually happened.\"",

        "description":"<p>No stories set in the Marvel Universe features actual time travel, since that's not possible in the <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> Universe. It's explained in many stories (Earth X, Exiles, others) that any occation where time travel is believed to occur, what is actually happening is either traveling to an alternate reality/dimension or creating a new alternate reality. In <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> it is quite more common as DC has comics from many more time frames than does Marvel (for instance the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super Heroes</a>.) Even in DC though it is not as common. One character, <a href=\"/rip-hunter/29-4937/\">Rip Hunter</a>, was once portrayed as unable to travel through time in the same manner more than once.</p><p>Time travel can be used humorously as well as more scientifically with the \"Grandfather Paradox\" commonly incorporated as a point of interest.</p><p>Characters and writers have many motivations for time travel such as:</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Preventing a future disaster by travelling backwards.</li><li>Travelling forwards to gain technology not yet available.</li><li>Accidentally being trapped in more or less idyllic settlings.</li><li>Rebooting a character or bringing them up-to-date.</li></ul><p>Also there are many plot devices to achieve time travel.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Cryogenic freezing and Stasis to allow passage of time.</li><li>Time machines.</li><li>Magic.</li></ul><h2>Types of Time Travel</h2><p><b>Predestination Paradox</b></p><p>A predestination paradox is also called a closed loop. It exists when a time traveler is caught in a loop of events that forces him or her to travel back in time. Because of the possibility of influencing the past while time travelling, one way of explaining why history does not change is by saying that whatever has happened was meant to happen. A time traveller attempting to alter the past in this situation, intends to fullfill the role in the possible future. For example, Cable was destined to kill Apocalypse. So he was forced to travel forward to the future and save mankind from the immortal mutant. He also had to go back in time and stop Apocalypse and prevent other certain events in the past.</p><p><b>Divergent Timelines</b></p><p>There has also been a series of different events that have been undone or postponed due to interference from the time travellers. For example, Charles Xavier's son Legion has travelled back in time to kill Magneto. Instead, he accidentally killed his own father. Legion was ceased to exist and a divergent timeline occurred as a result. This divergent timeline came to be known as Age of Apocalypse where the immortal mutant, Apocalypse once ruled. Some other events also seem to be a predestination paradox of sorts, where time travel is required to maintain a timeline rather than altering it.</p><p><b>Alternate Futures</b></p><p>There are events capable of influencing the others simply by the fact that every additional time travel event into the past or future establishes yet another set of possibilities. Multiple reactions to these timelines have been depicted, ranging from the seamless integration of separate future participants in certain situations, to spontaneous reality shifts, erasing events and consequences from the face of the multiverse in the blink of an eye. For example, the Days of Future Past storyline of the X-Men series occurred as a result of the assassination of Senator Kelly who used to hate mutants until he learned that there can be peace. However, that peace has been affected by the Sentinels. Any action that has been made in the past would lead to a drastic future. Another example would be the creation of Skynet lead to the destruction of humanity in the Terminator franchise. For this reason, certain time travellers had to jump back into the past to prevent the creation of Skynet. But several attempts have been failed due to the wrong information such as how to find the creator of Skynet or how and when to destroy it.</p><p><b>Parallel Universes</b></p><p>The parallel universes are a multitude of universes which exists in the same physical space but have a different dimensional structure from one another. A parallel universe can also occur when a time traveller attempts to alter the past. Therefore, a separate timeline or a parallel universe has been created. For example, a divergent timeline called the Age of Apocalypse has been created due to the result of Legion's actions in the past. However, there are altered timelines which are not necessarily considered as parallel universes. The House of M storyline would be considered as an altered universe rather than a separate one. There are also parallel universes where time travel has not been used to alter the course of events.</p><p><b>Alternate History</b></p><p>An alternate history happens when a reality has already been depicted by an author's point of view. Alternate histories were also considered as parallel histories which are similar to our history. An alternate history can also occur when a time traveller changes something in the past. That past will also lead to unknown consequences in a possible future.</p><h3>Known time travelers:</h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/barnabas-collins/29-62355/\">Barnabas Collins</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/booster-gold/29-1786/\">Booster Gold</a> (friend of Rip hunter, and guardian of the Time Stream)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emmett-brown/29-62298/\">Dr. Emmett Brown</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-doctor/29-33354/\">The Doctor</a> (Doctor Who)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash/29-2354/\">Flash</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fry/29-40848/\">Phillip J Fry</a> (Fry from Futurama)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rip-hunter/29-4937/\">Rip Hunter</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/immortus/29-7215/\">Kang the Conquerer/Immortus</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-kirk/29-20078/\">Captain Kirk</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marty-mcfly/29-62299/\">Marty McFly</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/master/29-50781/\">The Master</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mister-e/29-28541/\">Mister E</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-stranger/29-3298/\">Phantom Stranger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/poizon/29-50645/\">Poizon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sSuperman/29-1807/\">Superman</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mark-swift-and-the-time-retarder/29-61679/\">Mark Swift and his Time Retarder</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terminator/29-13852/\">The Terminator</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/timewalker/29-1542/\">Timewalker</a> (Ivar Anni-Padda)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trunks/29-40747/\">Trunks</a></li><li><a href=\"/hiro-nakamura/29-47668/\">Hiro Nakamura</a></li><li><a href=\"/bonnie-baxter/29-33205/\">Bonnie Baxter</a></li></ul>",

To this end Eon saw the need for the universe to have a protector. He created the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quantum-bands/18-42361/\">Quantum Bands</a>, devices of nearly unmatched in power to act not only as tools for his protector but as symbols of the station. A Protector required the necessary attributes of Intelligence, Courage, and Resourcefulness to be a worthy of the Quantum Bands and Eon\u2019s universal protector. In many cases it is believed that Eon will appoint a Protector for a particular mission, not only to protect the universe, but to protect it (or a part of it) from a particular threat such as, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> or <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maelstrom/29-2493/\">Maelstrom</a>. Only one appointed protector should be operating at a time as appointed by Eon or her child, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/epoch/29-6143/\">Epoch</a>. For nearly as long as the universe has been in existance there has been a Protector.</p><p>It's worth noting that there is a vague connection between the Protectors of the Universe and Cosmic Awareness. Eon being a time being and an abstract entity is sometimes known as the Keeper of Cosmic Awareness. As such Eon has been known to bestow Cosmic Awareness upon his Protectors, namely Mar-Vell and Wendell Vaughn. In the case of Mar-Vell the Awareness was even passed down to two of his children <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genis-vell/29-4813/\">Genis-Vell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phyla/29-40922/\">Phyla-Vell</a> to some degree.</p><h2>Known Protectors</h2><p>Over the course of millenia, there have been presumably countless beings appointed by Eon to preotect the universe, but only a few are known to us.</p><ul><li>a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stygian-starbender/29-53560/\">Stygian</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stygian-starbender/29-53560/\">Glakandar the Stygian Starbender</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ree/29-53729/\">Archeopian</a> (<a href=\"/ree/29-53729/\">Ree</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trantra/29-53732/\">Trill</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trantra/29-53732/\">Trantra</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Kree</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Mar-Vell</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>two Humans (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Wendell Vaughn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gravity/29-40452/\">Greg Willis</a>)</li></ul><ul><li>a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a> (Identity unknown)</li></ul><ul><li>a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/space-phantom/29-7243/\">Space Phantom</a> (Identity unknown)</li></ul><ul><li>an Elan (Identity unknown)</li></ul><ul><li>a Zen Whoberi (Andwella, species in question)</li><li>a cosmically enchanced <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firelord/29-7108/\">Xandarian</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firelord/29-7108/\">Firelord</a> in an alternate future)</li><li>a cosmically enchanced <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Zenn Lavian</a> (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">The Keeper</a>)</li></ul><p>The first Protector was known to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stygian-starbender/29-53560/\">Glakandar the Stygian Starbender</a> who operated early in the universe\u2019s history most of his history and the story of his life has not be revealed.</p><p>Another early Protector was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ree/29-53729/\">Ree</a> of the Archeopians, a bird-like species that was among the first to have their homeworld consumed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>. As such it is assumed that Ree was among the very first Protectors, it is unknown if he died in defense of his homeworld or not.

Though he never wore the Quantum Bands, he succeeded in defeating Thanos. He later died due to the ravages of diesease. Mar-Vell is perhaps the best known Protector of the Universe in recent times.</p><p>Mar-Vell was succeeded by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Wendell Vaughn</a>, an earthman who had donned the Quantum Bands years before. Calling himself Marvel Boy, then Marvel-Man, then finally Quasar and acting as security chief at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/project-pegasus/34-44379/\">Project PEGASUS</a>. He was charged with protecting Eon himself from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maelstrom/29-2493/\">Cosmic Assassin</a>, Quasar failed in this; being forced to kill Eon himself in order to protect the secret of Cosmic Awareness, but he did plunge the Cosmic Assassin in to a black hole destroying him and literally saving the universe. Quasar was later slain by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilus/29-10964/\">Annihilus</a>.</p><p>The Quantum Bands were later taken from Annihilus by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phyla/29-40922/\">Phyla-Vell</a> (daughter of Mar-Vell) though she had never been an <i>appointed</i> Protector.</p><p>After Eon\u2019s death his station was taken up by its offspring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/epoch/29-6143/\">Epoch</a> and after Vaughn\u2019s death appointed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gravity/29-40452/\">Greg Willis</a> and augmented his power to protect her from Galactus. After successfully defending Epoch against Galactus, Willis declined to formally take the station of Protector of the Universe.</p><p>As of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/annihilation/39-41287/\">Annihilation War</a>, there has not been an active Protector of the Universe with the death of the Wendell Vaughn, although Greg Willis briefly accepted the role after being appointed by Epoch and for a time after Annihilation Phyla-Vell considered herself the unoffical Protector with her weilding the Quantum Bands, perhaps she was simply ignorant of Epoch's role in appointing the Protector of the Universe. Quasar is still considered the Protector of the Universe with his recent resurrection according to Phyla-Vell and Nova Prime, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova/29-2105/\">Richard Rider</a>. Whether or not this is truly the case, only time will tell.</p>",

        "description":"Exactly when the Titans came to be, no one could say. Their size and strength was tremendous all the same. One Titan was named Hyperion. He was said to be the father of the sun, moon, and dawn. Another Titan, Iptetus, had two sons - Atlas, who bore the weight of the earth on his shoulders, and Prometheus, who angered the gods of Olympus by giving men the gift of fire. But the greatest of the Titans, the one who ruled all the others, was named Cronus.<br /><br />The Titans were the first gods, taller than mountains Gaea created to serve them as thrones, and both Earth and Sky were proud of them. There were six titans, and they had six sisters, the Titanesses, whom they took for their wives. <br /><br />When Gaea again gave birth, Uranus was not proud. Their new children were also huge, but each had only one glowing eye set in the middle of his forehead. They were the three Cyclopes and they were named Lightning, Thunder, and Thunderbolt. They were not handsome gods, but tremendously strong smiths. Sparks from their heavy hammers flashed across the sky and lit up the heavens so brightly that even their father's stars faded.<br /><br />After a while, Gaea bore three more sons, whom Uranus looked at with disgust. Each of them had fifty heads and a hundred strong arms. Uranus hated seeing these ugly creatures walk on lovely Earth, so he seized them and the Cyclopes and flung them into Tartarus, the deepest, darkest pit under the Earth.<br /><br />Mother Earth loved her children and could not forgive Uranus for his cruelty to them. Out of hardest flint she made a sickle and told her sons the Titans to take the weapon and kill their father. Five of the Titans took fear and they trembled and refused. Cronus, the youngest of the Titans, dared to take the sickle and strike down his father. Uranus could not withstand the weapon so he fled, giving up his powers.<br /><br />Gaea made Pontus, the boundless seas, her second husband. From this reunion sprang the gods of the watery depths. From Gaea's rich ground grew and abundance of trees and flowers. sprites, beasts, and early man crept forth from her crevices.",

But before <a href=\"/lilandra/29-6144/\">       Empress Lilandra</a> and her soldiers could do anything, the Black Celestial arrived on the scene and teleported them into the black hole.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />While Galactus continued to carry out his captor's commands, a group of heroes (<a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">          Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">         Thor</a> and <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">        The Fantastic Four</a>) from Earth-616 along with that timeline's <a href=\"/gladiator/29-4653/\">      Gladiator</a> were already beginning to unravel the monstrous Celestial's plot. <br />&nbsp;<br />After gaining a great deal of data vital to the Black Celestial's plans as well as a major history lesson that explained his reasons for carrying out this insane crusade to annihilate the universe, the heroes of 616 confronted the Black Celestial and threatened to travel backwards in time to warn <a href=\"/arishem-the-judge/29-32857/\">            Arishem the Judge</a> and the other <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">           Celestials</a> of the catastrophe that would occur in their future. Infuriated, the Black Celestial chased after the 616 heroes across all of history while Gladiator sacrificed his life to destroy the facility that was slowly restoring the Celestial's power back to its former levels. <br />&nbsp;<br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2060097\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2060097-dreamer002.jpg\" title=\"\u00a0Tyranny's End.\"><img id=\"2060097\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/2060097-dreamer002_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\u00a0Tyranny's End.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\u00a0Tyranny's End.</div></div></div></div> \nBecause he was filled with so much rage, hatred and desperation the Black Celestial did not realize what had happened and that he was quickly draining all of his remaining power. When the 616 heroes returned to the present, they dove straight towards the black hole and quickly teleported themselves out of the way thanks to the power of Mjolnir. Due to his major loss of power, the Black Celestial was unable to do the same and plunged head first into the black hole.<br />&nbsp;<br />After absorbing the Black Celestial's life essence into himself, Galactus momentarily regained control of his own mind but was unable to free himself of the Celestial's contraption. With no other options available, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">   Mr. Fantastic </a>handed the Ultimate Nullifier, which he had taken from the devourer's worldship sometime prior to the Black Celestial's defeat over to Galactus, who then proceeded to destroy himself and all of existence.<br /><br /><h2>The Second Engine </h2> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"624966\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/624966-burning_super.jpg\" title=\"Falling into a trap.\"><img id=\"624966\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/624966-burning_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Falling into a trap.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Falling into a trap.</div></div></div></div>     Five Hundred Years after the end of The Marvel Age, Earth began to die and without the technology required to build any starships that could ferry the eight billion inhabitants off-world Humanity's survival looked bleak.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />However, <a href=\"/hulk-jr/29-58485/\">                                                        Robert Bruce Banner Jr.</a>, the adoptive son of <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">                                                       Wolverine</a>, immediately devised a plan to create a time machine that would allow them to transport the entire human population back in time to Earth-616. &nbsp;Many were skeptical of his plans success rate but in the end they agreed to help execute it for the sake of the eight billion lives they had sworn to protect.<br />&nbsp;<br />Robert's plan was to lure <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">                                                      Galactus</a>, the Devourer of Worlds, into a trap he could not resist by putting out enough energy to make their dying Earth seem a very appealing source of food for the cosmic glutton.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />When Galactus arrived to consume the world that had eluded him for so long, he came under attack from Earth's heroes, and responded in kind by systematically killing off as many heroes as he could.&nbsp;Though he managed to kill nearly all of the super-humans, seven heroes survived and were finally able to bring Galactus down after a long, arduous final battle.<br />&nbsp;<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"617585\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/617585-power_abused_super.jpg\" title=\"Beyond agony.\"><img id=\"617585\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/617585-power_abused_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Beyond agony.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Beyond agony.</div></div></div></div>     After lobotomizing him, Robert used all of their technological resources to tap into Galactus' power and send both him and his group, <a href=\"/fantastic-force/65-18869/\">                                       The Nu-Defenders</a>, into the past where they would have access to the technology required to create a time machine powerful enough to transport eight billion people across the time-stream. <br />&nbsp;<br />After having gained the technology required to build what would soon become known as \"The Galactus Engine\", The Nu-Defenders set out on an endeavor to capture <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">                                                     Doctor Doom</a> and <a href=\"/human-torch/29-2120/\">                                                    The Human Torch</a>, which they did and then turned them into \"batteries/power conduits\" for the Engine by fusing them with the ex-Devourer.<br />&nbsp;<br />The Engine was soon activated and delivered untold pain to all three living parts of The Galactus Engine, though only Doom managed to keep calm and refrain from screaming in unison with the agony-ridden Galactus and Johnny Storm, a feat which greatly impressed The Nu-Defenders. <br /><br />&nbsp;When the rest of                         The Fantastic Four arrived to save Doom and The Human Torch, they found that The Galactus Engine could not be turned off nor could they free the two captives whose lives were in danger the most without causing the Engine to explode and tear the Universe asunder.&nbsp;Nevertheless, they could not allow eight billion inhabitants of another Earth to be transported to the already near-overpopulated Earth-616 and so, Mr. Fantastic rerouted the coordinates they had been sent and teleported the refugees to Nu-Earth.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1112749\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39876/1112749-ff_575_016_super.jpg\" title=\"R.I.P.

It was not long before her allies as well as the mortal armies of 616 began to drop like flies. <br />&nbsp;<br />Though it was not seen firsthand, Quasar remarked that The Galactus Engine had actually begun forcing the cosmic entities and their mortal allies into retreating, though because of all the confusion and chaos going on at the front lines it was impossible to tell just how many of the cosmic beings had actually fled from the front lines. <br />&nbsp;<br />Following the return of Nova's strike-force from their mission to rescue <a href=\"/major-victory/29-2166/\">                             Major Victory</a> and <a href=\"/namorita/29-2113/\">                            Namorita</a>, Queen Medusa explained to them that The Galactus Engine had proved to be the most powerful and monstrous threat on the battlefield so far, which had wiped out or forced into retreating all but five of the High Abstracts that had come to assist the lesser beings in fending off the Cancerverse's assault vanguard earlier on.<br />&nbsp;<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1459385\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1459385-the_engine_super.jpg\" title=\"Galactus and his crew struggle holding his counterpart at bay.\"><img id=\"1459385\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1459385-the_engine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Galactus and his crew struggle holding his counterpart at bay.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Galactus and his crew struggle holding his counterpart at bay.</div></div></div></div>     The five remaining High Abstracts; Galactus,             Arishem the Judge and three nameless Celestials who, despite focusing every iota of their vast power into combating The Galactus Engine, were noted in the reports Medusa received from the front lines as being barely able to hold The Galactus Engine back.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />To make things even worse, other reports had confirmed that there were larger, more powerful creatures (possibly The Many-Angled Ones themselves) coming through The Fault from behind The Galactus Engine and the two parsec-wide assault vanguard flanking it. <br />&nbsp;<br />Eventually, Arishem and the other three Celestials were overwhelmed and possibly destroyed by The Galactus Engine, leaving only Galactus to fight back against his monstrous counterpart. But as their fight progressed, The Galactus Engine unleashed hundreds of robotic tendrils from its mouth and began wrapping them around Galactus' arms. <br />&nbsp;<br />As it began to pull him downward, Galactus found himself being assisted by the lesser beings fighting in this war, who had all decided that The Galactus Engine should be everyone's priority now that the other High Abstracts had been killed. But even with the promise of what little aid they could provide, the outcome of this fight still looked grim.<br />&nbsp;<br />Then, when all hope seemed lost, <a href=\"/death/29-12620/\">                      Mistress Death</a> obliterated The Cancerverse and caused The Fault to collapse in on itself, creating a back-rip that pulled The Galactus Engine and any portions of the assault vanguard that hadn't turned to dust down into oblivion.

After the end of World War II, however, super heroes fell out of favor with readers. As quickly as they had arrived, the majority of these heroes and their publishers disappeared. Copyrights were not protected as adamantly in those days, and many of these characters and their adventures have since fallen into the <a href=\"/in-the-public-domain/57-2526/\">Public Domain</a>.</p><p>This allows any publisher or creator to use the characters and the original Golden Age material any way they wish. <a href=\"/ac/57-335/\">AC Comics</a> was one of the first publishers to capitalize on this, by both reprinting Golden Age classics and incorporating these \"forgotten\" heroes into their new material as well. Other publishers have also taken to the idea and have created new universes featuring these characters, sometimes focusing on the characters of only one company, and other times picking the best characters from several companies.</p><p><b><i><u>Publishers represented in this list Include:</u></i></b></p><p><b><a href=\"/ace-magazines/57-32/\"><i>Ace</i></a></b></p><p><b><i>American Comic Group/ACG</i></b></p><p><b><i>Ajax-Farrell</i></b></p><p><b><i>Avon Comics/Realistic</i></b></p><p><b><i>Better/Nedor/Standard/Pines Publications</i></b></p><p><b><i>Biro Publishing/Lev Gleason/Comic House</i></b></p><p><b><i>Centaur Publishing</i></b></p><p><b><i>Charlton Comics (some titles are not PD)</i></b></p><p><b><i>Columbia Comics</i></b></p><p><b><i>Comic Media</i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Comics Magazine Company Inc</u></i></b></p><p><b><i>Croydon Publishing/Rural Home/Enwil Associates/REWL Publications</i></b></p><p><b><i>D.S.

Our universe is but one amongst an infinite number within the multiverse.<br /><br /><div>The cosmic squish principle is the theory that one can compress several universes into one with devastating effect. While appearing much earlier in the comics, the cosmic squish was first named as such in issues of the Sensational She-Hulk when Dr. Angst created a \"cosmic blowhole\" of sorts to draw forth a number of encroaching realities (called encroachiverses). These encroachiverses were, essentially, failed dimensions which had been compacted into receptacles to prevent interdimensional intermingling. The idea was to establish five stable points in the universe and let the rest of our universe \"squish\" with the encroachiverses. The resulting destruction would leave a new universe, one which Doctor Angst could control and shape at his own whim.</div><br /><div>Strangely, this wasn't the first or only time something like this has been put into effect in the comics. Howard the Duck's first appearance in the Marvel Universe could be best described as a result of &nbsp;a \"Cosmic Squish\" enacted by Thog, Overlord of Sominus.

Through his journeys he will come face to face with both his fears and weaknesses. This man will also once again feel the freedom that has always been what drives him onward and in the end he will be something greater than even he could have anticipated while still retaining his rebellious charm. That is the story of The Fool and as John Constantine is the man of many adventures who fights authorities even as mighty as the supreme rulers of both Heaven and Hell, it is his story too. Of course, the most important factor representing The Fool is his number, zero, signifying his way of being outside of others way of doing things, being his own person, not tied by others. This is reflected in Constantine who is without position of power or followers, who has lost many a lover by his refusing to settle down and like the Fool gets into trouble just for the experience.</p><p>As for the image itself, the stereotypical \"Fool card\" is a man about to step off a cliff with an animal dancing behind him and a flower in his hand, basking in the sun's rays. That is not what we see in the Vertigo card, here the sun has become a nuclear explosion, the flowers are devoid of life, the animal is reduced to a skeleton, for this is seeing The Fool through the eyes of Vertigo, reflecting the price of making freedom the thing you value most above all else.</p><p>It should also be mentioned that in the fourth issue of the original <a href=\"/the-books-of-magic/49-4354/\">Books of Magic</a> series, Tim Hunter and <a href=\"/mister-e/29-28541/\">Mr. E</a> arrive at a time in the future where only the Tarot exist as they are the combined identities of all who fit their characteristics and Tim says The Fool reminds him a lot of John Constantine in appearance.</p><h3>I -The Magician</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"692806\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/692806-01_the_magician_super.jpg\" title=\"The Magician\"><img id=\"692806\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/692806-01_the_magician_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Magician\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Magician</div></div></div></div><p><b>Vertigo Counterpart</b>: <a href=\"/tim-hunter/29-23215/\">Tim Hunter</a></p><p><b>Astrological Symbol</b>: Mercury</p><p><b>Card's Meaning</b>: Power and Knowledge</p><p><b>Reversed</b>: Weakness and Suppressed Energy</p><p>Traditionally, in a Tarot deck, The Fool is meant to be the youth while The Magician is the experienced, wise one, but in the Tarot deck, things are rather the opposite. In this deck, The Fool is one of the most powerful beings in the field of magic, and The Magician is one who has the potential to be the greatest but is still merely learning. The Magician represents the act of taking on great responsibility, as in the original Books of Magic series, Tim Hunter was forced to take on the responsibility of his destiny, not even given a choice in the matter, though he was deceived in to thinking he had one.</p><p>The first of the numbered cards, The Magician is the first thing The Fool encounters on his journey and usually represents the \"active principle\", things such as creativity, will and masculinity (not men specifically, however). In the picture we see Tim's glasses, the light reflecting off of them, displaying the typical nerd, while the book insinuates the study and effort it requires to become a great mage. In the traditional image of the card, The Magician is usually pointing his wand to the heavens with another pointing to the earth to represent we are not the power, but the ones who channel creative power. In this picture Tim is also channeling the energy but almost reluctantly, not too quick to seize the power he shall channel. What differs between John Constantine and Tim Hunter in this role is that while both possess the power to be The Magician, only Tim has the responsibility, meaning he can become a far greater danger than John will ever be.</p><h3>II -The High Priestess</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"692807\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/692807-02_the_high_priestess_super.jpg\" title=\"The High Priestess\"><img id=\"692807\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/692807-02_the_high_priestess_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The High Priestess\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The High Priestess</div></div></div></div><p><b>Vertigo Counterpart</b>: <a href=\"/mad-hettie/29-21059/\">Mad Hettie</a></p><p><b>Astrological Symbol</b>: The Moon</p><p><b>Card's Meaning</b>: Being Still and Wise, Knowing Things that Can't Be Explained</p><p><b>Reversed</b>: Becoming Active, Seeking Out What is Yours By Right</p><h3>III -The Empress</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"692808\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/692808-03_the_empress_super.jpg\" title=\"The Empress\"><img id=\"692808\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/692808-03_the_empress_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Empress\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Empress</div></div></div></div><p><b>Vertigo Counterpart</b>: <a href=\"/titania/29-21031/\">Titania</a></p><p><b>Astrological Symbol</b>: Venus</p><p><b>Card's Meaning</b>: Passion, Desire and Motherhood</p><p><b>Reversed</b>: Emotional Detachment and Thinking Through Things</p><h2>Minor Arcana</h2><h3>Wands</h3><h3>Cups</h3><h3>Swords</h3><h3>Pentacles</h3><h2>Court Cards</h2><h3>Pages</h3><h3>Knights</h3><h3>Queens</h3><h3>Kings</h3>",

        "description":"<h2>Comic Synopsis </h2>Magic is a supernatural force. It can be channeled into something fantastic like the creation of a dragon out of thin air, or something relatively mundane like making small objects levitate. In order to harness the raw power of magic, an individual requires certain skills and/or attributes (such as training, innate ability via heredity or something else, etc), and even then the amount of magical power any one person can control is usually limited. Manifesting in a variety of ways, the methods used to channel magic are diverse; incantations, artifacts, complex rituals, potions, the list goes on and on.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />While magic itself is merely raw power, therefore incapable of possessing any innate morality, it is sometimes seen as purely 'good' or 'evil'. As previously stated, this is not only illogical but impossible, and it falls upon the user to decide whether to use the powers they wield honorably or not (just as it falls upon any individual with power). That being said, there are many individuals within the world of comics that utilize magic, both villains and heroes.<br /><h2>DC Comics </h2>Characters like <a href=\"/doctor-fate/29-5898/\">                  Dr. Fate</a>, <a href=\"/zatanna/29-5691/\">                 Zatanna</a>, and <a href=\"/zatara/29-19190/\">                Zatara </a>have used magic to fight crime.&nbsp; Zatanna casts her magic by reciting the desired action backwards (though as has been stated this is a mental exercise for her to focus on the complex magics.) &nbsp;In <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">           DC Comics</a>, magic has been considered entirely separate from science.&nbsp; It has also been established that magic always has it's price. &nbsp;Many of the DC heroes which use magic are dependent on magical items such as the <a href=\"/helmet-of-fate/18-56063/\">Helmet of Fate</a> or the <a href=\"/ruby-of-life/18-43295/\">Ruby of Life</a>, though the same characters that use these items may display some magic abilities without them. &nbsp;Of course these magical items all have their value due to their rareness and power.&nbsp; Magic is also one of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">               Superman</a>'s few weaknesses.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><h2>Marvel Comics&nbsp; <br /></h2>In Marvel, some characters that employ magic are <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">         Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"/witchfire/29-26481/\">        Witchfire</a>, <a href=\"/magik/29-8303/\">       Magik</a>, <a href=\"/ashake/29-42895/\">      Ashake</a>, <a href=\"../../brother-voodoo/29-10280/\" rel=\"nofollow\">     Brother Voodoo</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">    Doctor Doom</a>, <a href=\"/forge/29-4279/\">   Forge</a>, <a href=\"../../nico-minoru/29-1940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">  Nico Minoru</a>,(though the <a href=\"/staff-of-one/18-40449/\">Staff of One </a>is the only way she is able to use magic) and <a href=\"/enchantress/29-7225/\"> Enchantress</a>.<br /><h2>Newspaper Comics <br /></h2> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1507389\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1507389-55_1_super.jpg\" title=\"Capturing a full size plane\"><img id=\"1507389\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1507389-55_1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Capturing a full size plane\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Capturing a full size plane</div></div></div></div>     In the 1940's newspaper's who were concerned with superhero comics cutting into their profits started publishing full sized comic books in the weekly newspaper.&nbsp; For a while a character known as <a href=\"/mr-mystic/29-24751/\">             Mr. Mystic</a> was feature in every issue.&nbsp; Mr. Mystic seemingly had the power to do anything and was made invulnerable due to an amulet he wore.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Mr. Mystic was able to enlarge himself to a size where he was able to capture planes with his bare hands.&nbsp; He could transform himself or anyone else into different objects.&nbsp; He could even melt a person into a puddle.&nbsp; Mr. Mystic is also able to transport himself into another place by his magic.",

        "description":"<p><b>Project Rebirth</b> was a project assigned to the <a href=\"/us-army/65-44415/\">US Army</a> by the US Government. This was so the Army could have a line of Supersoldiers to assist them in <a href=\"/world-war-i/12-56026/\">World War I</a>. The project was part of a large operation called <a href=\"/weapon-plus/65-40591/\">Weapon Plus</a>. The operation was a collaboration between US, British and German scientists and it was lead by <a href=\"/abraham-erskine/29-43681/\">Dr. Abraham Erskine</a> and Koch. When <a href=\"/world-war-ii/12-56025/\">World War II</a> started, the Geman part split from the original experiment and Koch took over that portion. Dr. Erksine became the primary leader of the USA program and created the chemical formula and the specific experiment which could create Supersoldiers. This formula has not been reproduced by any other scientist. Many people were intent on recovering Erksine's work since it was believed that the serum would work on any type of person although, the chemical and Vita Ray process was shown to work in 1 out of 4 patients.</p><p>Two other subjects were tested before this, Queen and Clinton McIntyre. McIntyre a.k.a. <a href=\"/protocide/29-53163/\">Protocide</a> was a failed experiment which left him suspended in animation until he was revived by AIM in the modern day. <a href=\"/queen/29-41418/\">Queen</a> was the very first testing of the experiment and was tested on before Steve Rogers.</p><p>Before testing on Rogers, Erksine had to refine the process multiple times but eventually converted the frail Rogers into <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>. Since the process had to be refined multiple times, it is suggested that other failed participants may be found. Original history makes the claim that Captain America was the only test subject.</p><p>All of the changes Erskine made to the process which made the experiment successful with Rogers, including the Vita Ray portion, were lost when he died as he never documented his research. The German spy who killed Dr. Erskine found some of his research, and that was the basis of Rogers II using this process to become Captain America again in the 1950's.</p><p>After Erksine's tragic murder, a man named Wilfred Nagel took over the project. Nagel's attempt to recreate the project on mass amounts of people did not succeed. But he did succeed in creating African-American Supersoldiers (the most widely known one was Isaiah Bradley). Three hundred soldiers were sacrificed and taken from Camp Cathcart to recreate Erksine's original experiment. Of those three hundred African-American soldiers, only five men survived and the rest either died or were executed. Nagel claimed to the families that they died in battle.</p><p>Nagel did make a few successful samples like Colonel Walker Price. Price was kept young and muscular into his 90's.</p><p>Weapon Plus believes Steven Rogers I is its most successful creation.</p>",

        "description":"Stargate universe is the universe in which the events of Stargate: SG1, Atlantis and the newest serie Universe, take place.<br /><br /> <h2>Premise</h2><br />The events of the Stargate Universe revolve around the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stargate/18-48480/\">Stargate</a>, a device made by a race known as the Ancients long ago. Stargate allow instantaneous travel between any to any other Stargate in the network, connecting wast regions of space. Naturally, this makes them a point of conflict between many races who wish to control them for their own purposes. <br /><br />The humans of Earth have recently discovered a Stargate and learned to use it, bringing them in conflict with races such as Goa'uld, Ori and the Wraith. Through conflict with these race, and the guidance of older races, humans, or Tau'ri, as they are known, have become major players on the galactic stage. There are other humans living throughout the universe, having been seeded by the Goa'uld, the Ancients and the Ori long ago.<br /><br /> <br /> <h2>Setting</h2><br />Events of the series mainly take place in the Milky way and Pegasus galaxies. Milky way has until recently been under the dominion of the Goa'uld, bit they have been overthrown recently, and the Tau'ri are now the most powerful race in the galaxy. Pegasus was recently discovered by the Tau'ri which have since then been fighting a war with the Wraith, the dominant force in Pegasus.<br />Also known are the Ida galaxy, which is the home of the Asgard, and the Ori home Galaxy, from which the Ori launched attack on the Milky way, though they have been defeated by the Tau'ri.<br /><br /> <h2>Species</h2><br />The Stargate universe is filled with many species on various stages of development, ranging from relative cavemen, to grand cosmic races. This is a list of Stargate species:<br /><br /> <h3>The Four Great Races</h3><br />An alliance of the oldest and most advanced races in the known universe.<br /> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ancients/65-56313/\">Ancients </a>- Arguably the most advanced species in Stargate. They are the original builders of Stargates, and their technology is far more sophisticated than even that of the other members of the alliance. Due to a plague thousands of years ago, the Ancients have left this plane of the universe and now exist as beings of pure energy.  </li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/65-56316/\">Asgard </a>- A benevolent race resembling the Roswell greys. They have acted as Norse Gods on Earth thousands of years ago, and have protected many planets throughout the galaxy from the Goa'uld. Their latest technology is nearly on par with the Ancients, though they have even surpassed them in several fields. They are extinct as of the last episode of SG-1.  </li><li><a href=\"/nox/65-56838/\">Nox</a> - a pacifist race which will not engage in conflict under any circumstances. As such, they have developed technology for hiding and escape. They have the technology to become invisible, they can make&nbsp;them selfs invisible and other things.&nbsp;</li><li>Furlings - Fourth members of the alliance, next to nothing is known about them.</li></ul><br /> <h3>Humans</h3><br />Tau'ri - \"The First ones\", Humans of Earth. The present day humans who have rose to become a dominant player in the galaxy.<br /><br /> <h3>Other</h3><br /> <ul class=\"plain-list\"> <li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goauld/65-56372/\">Goa'uld</a> - a parasite race which takes humans as host and scavenges the technology of other races. They have dominated Milky way for thousands of years, though they have recently been destroyed as a faction.  </li><li>Ori - Same race as the ancients, and like them they exist on another plane. They force lesser races to worship them as gods. Recently destroyed by the Tau'ri.  </li><li>Replicators - machine entities, enemies of the Asgard, destroyed. Also another version created by the Ancients in the Pegasus galaxy, known as the Asurans,&nbsp;enimies of the Wraith and&nbsp;the humans in Pegasus.&nbsp; </li><li><a href=\"/jaffa/65-56836/\">Jaffa</a> - Genetically engineered humans created by the Goa'uld to serve them. With the fall of the Goa'uld they have recently formed their own nation and are growing stronger.  </li><li><a href=\"/wraith/65-56837/\">Wraith</a> - A race in control of the Pegasus galaxy. They feed on humans, and have been fighting a war with the Tau'ri for several years now. The race that defeated the ancients in war 10,000 years ago. </li><li>Unas - Original hosts of the Goa'uld. They are on a stone age level of development.</li></ul>",

His <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinestro-corps/65-42352/\">Sinestro Corps</a> waged a bloody war against the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\">Green Lantern Corps</a>, killing hundreds of Green Lanterns. These actions provoked the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-universe/65-9057/\">Guardians of the Universe</a> to enact ten new laws to prevent the War of Light from happening, and they began with authorizing the use of lethal force. The Sinestro Corps lost the war which culminated in an enormous battle on the planet Earth, and Sinestro was captured along with many of members of his Corps. The rest of his Corps scattered throughout the universe. But the damage had already been done. Sinestro's war was the spark needed to ignite the War of Light.</p><h3>Sins of the Star Sapphires</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759110\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35011/759110-starsapphirecorps_super.png\" title=\"\"><img id=\"759110\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35011/759110-starsapphirecorps_medium.png\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Inspired by the efficacy of the Guardians' Green Lantern Corps, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zamarons/65-39176/\">Zamarons</a> reforged their Star Sapphire alien gems into rings and constructed a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-sapphire-corps-central-battery/18-56013/\">Central Power Battery</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zamaron/34-55959/\">Zamaron</a> fueled with the violet light of love. The Zamarons philosophically disagreed with the Guardians' methods of imprisonment and punishment. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/star-sapphire-corps/65-49913/\">Star Sapphires</a> began soaring through the universe, hunting down members of the Sinestro Corps to subject them to a forced conversion process that would turn them towards the ways of love and the ways of the Star Sapphire. The Guardians attempted to negotiate with the Star Sapphires' leader, Queen Aga'po, but she refused their demands that she pull back her Corps. The Star Sapphires would continue their advance on the universe, as well as their campaign against the Sinestro Corps.</p><h3>Rage of the Red Lanterns</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"725617\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/725617-welcome_to_my_corps_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"725617\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/725617-welcome_to_my_corps_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Yet another corps lit its light in the universe. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atrocitus/29-51905/\">Atrocitus</a> discovered how to burn the red light of hate and founded his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-lantern-corps/65-50747/\">Red Lantern Corps</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ysmault/34-55871/\">Ysmault</a>, the prison planet he had been sentenced to by the Guardians. He populated his Corps with beings who had suffered terrible wrongs at the hands of the Sinestro Corps and had an overwhelming desire for vengeance, as he personally did for Sinestro. The Red Lanterns made their debut by tearing through Sinestro Corps and Green Lantern alike to abduct Sinestro from his imprisoned transport to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/korugar/34-55818/\">Korugar</a>. Before Sinestro could to tortured to death on Ysmault, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hal-jordan/29-11202/\">Hal Jordan</a> of the Green Lanterns, a unit from the Sinestro Corps and two members of the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-lantern-corps/65-50163/\">Blue Lantern Corps</a> descended upon the planet to rescue him. Atrocitus plotted revenge against the Blue Lanterns, casting blood magic rituals to locate their homeworld, and the Guardians also plotted retaliation against him, making preparations to dispatch their <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-lanterns/65-49719/\">Alpha Lanterns</a> to Ysmault.</p><h3>Raid on the Vega System</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"773635\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/773635-11300_400x600_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"773635\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/773635-11300_400x600_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-controllers/65-22708/\">Controllers</a> sought out the orange light of avarice on the planet <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/okaara/34-53799/\">Okaara</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vega-system/34-55817/\">Vega System</a> and were unprepared to discovered it had already been harnessed into an <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/orange-lantern-corps/65-50745/\">Orange Lantern Corps</a> by a being named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agent-orange/29-58504/\">Larfleeze</a>. This was the final straw for him, as already both the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps were trespassing on his territory. The Vega System was promised to him by the Guardians if he kept his Orange Lanterns buried there, and he threatened that he would no longer do so if they did not meet his demands. The Guardians responded by calling off their pact with Larfleeze completely and launched an all out assault on the Vega System to take what was his. On Okaara, Larfleeze retaliated by releasing his own Orange Lanterns against the Guardians and their Green Lanterns. The two forces clashed and wound down to a draw, with the Guardians negotiating an end of hostilities with Larfleeze. He wanted only one thing to end the conflict. He wanted to know where one could get a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blue-power-ring/18-55735/\">blue ring</a> like the one Hal Jordan had worn.</p><h3>The War of Light Explodes</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"851079\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/851079-blue_vs._orange_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"851079\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/851079-blue_vs._orange_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>After all of these individual skirmishes, the War of Light began raging across the universe.

Elsewhere, the Yellow and Violet clashed as Sinestro led his forces to Zamaron to reclaim his captured people from the Star Sapphires. More war wages on Ysmault, where the <a href=\"/lost-lanterns/65-50652/\">Lost Lanterns</a> and Alpha Lanterns of the Green Lantern Corps came to lay siege upon Atrocitus and his Red Lantern Corps. Only the Indigo Tribe remained uninvolved thus far, but the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-blackest-night/39-55766/\">Blackest Night</a> had come.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Kaiju</h2><p>Kaiju is the <a href=\"/japan/34-55746/\">Japanese</a> name for Giant Monsters. Unlike American Giant Monsters who have generic names like the 50-foot woman, kaiju are given specific name like <a href=\"/rodan/29-56719/\">Rodan</a> and Gigan. There are many famous kaiju. The most famous is <a href=\"/godzilla/29-21599/\">Godzilla</a>, who first appeared in the 1954 film <i>Gojira</i>. Other famous kaiju include <a href=\"/gamera/29-41556/\">Gamera</a> and <a href=\"/mothra/29-41648/\">Mothra</a>. Kaiju usually appear in Japan but can be other places like small islands that are usually uninhabited. Kaiju are usually portrayed as a force of destruction being neither good nor evil but some like <a href=\"/mothra/29-41648/\">Mothra</a> and <a href=\"/gamera/29-41556/\">Gamera</a> are always portrayed as good monsters who defend Earth from evil alien invaders. Others like <a href=\"/king-ghidorah/29-41557/\">King Ghidorah</a> and Gigan are always portrayed as evil aliens who have come to destroy Earth.</p><h2>List Of Giant Monsters</h2><h3>Godzilla

He first asked where the survivor of the crash was, and was answered truthfully. He next asked how he would die, and was answered truthfully, albeit prophetically. Lastly, he asked what would become of the Green Lantern Corps. This was Qull's answer:<br />&nbsp;<br />\"After untold millennia, the enemies of the Green Lantern Corps will rise united against them. The Corps shall be destroyed to the last life form. The planet <a href=\"/oa/34-41360/\">              Oa</a> shall be as dust.

He was never able to perform the dance with anyone because none were compatible with him.<br /><br /><h3>The Dance</h3>Two beings of equal size and power must perform the dance in order for it to work. Their power levels must be identical. <br /><br />The dance must be performed in perfect symmetry. Movements and breathing must be exact or the fusion will fail. A failure usually results in a failed fusion, a powerless or sickly version of a proper fusion.<br /><br /><h3>Time Limits</h3>The fusion will only last 30 minutes, sometimes less depending on how much energy is used. Once the fusion is over, the beings cannot fuse again for one hour.<br /><br /><h3>Fused beings</h3>The only ones to do the fusion in the manga were <a href=\"/goten/29-40745/\">  Goten </a>and <a href=\"/trunks/29-40747/\">  Trunks</a>. Their fusion resulted in the being known as <a href=\"/gotenks/29-51122/\">  Gotenks</a>.<br /><br />In non-canon appearances (movies and Dragonball GT), Goku and <a href=\"/vegeta/29-40722/\">  Vegeta </a>performed the dance to become  Gogeta.<br /><br /><h2>Potara Fusion</h2>This fusion requires no technique. It is the secret of the Supreme Kai's. Their earrings can be taken and one put on the right ear of one person and on the left of another. This will draw the two together to create an incredibly powerful being. Once this is done it is permanent and cannot be undone.<br /><br /><h3>Known Potara Fusions</h3> <ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><a href=\"/elder-kai/29-65018/\">Old Kai</a>- Old Kai was tricked by a witch and forced to combine with her forever.
