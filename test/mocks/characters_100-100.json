He started training in the martial arts at an early age, deeming to become Takuma's successor. Ryo was instilled by his father with the hard principle of self-reliance where one's strength can form their own worth in the world. He eventually got a sparring partner and friend in Robert Garcia when Robert was admitted into the dojo.</p><p>Ryo's mother died in a tragic car accident on Ryo's 10th birthday. Takuma left their home and left Ryo to take care of Yuri. In order to do so, he worked in construction and tirelessly strived to defend his family's dojo. He also started street fighting, remembering his father's words. He didn't do well at first, but after a lot of years of persistence, he eventually became a famous and feared fighter.</p><h2>Art of Fighting</h2><p>In the first game, Yuri gets kidnapped by Mr. Big, a local crime leader of the dangerous city, Southtown. During his journey on saving Yuri, he met a bouncer named King, who leads him and Robert to Mr. Big's location. With Robert and King's aids, Ryo confronts and defeats the kingpin. Chasing Mr. Big lead him to a karate dojo where a mysterious man in a tengu mask challenges him. When Ryo prevailed, he threatens to finish Mr. Karate if he doesn't give any information regarding Yuri's safety. Before he deals the final blow, Yuri reveals the man's identity as Takuma, their father. After eleven years of separation, the whole family is reunited.</p><p>Before the events of the second game, Ryo went into the mountains for training. He received an invitation to the King of Fighters tournament, which he accepted in order to test his strength. He was able to reach the finals and then the tournament's host, Geese Howard, wanted to hire Ryo into his services. Ryo refuses however and subsequently defeats him. Unfortunately, Geese manages to escape and later reenacts the beginning of the Fatal Fury story.</p><p>Ryo's role in the third game was reduced to being a supporting character for Robert. In his ending for the game, he hands over a ticket to Yuri for Robert's flight back home and wishes the best for both of them. He also gains another rival called Kasumi Todoh, who is later mentioned in The King of Fighters series.</p><p>It is assumed that after the Art of Fighting series ended, Takuma retired from fighting and entrusts the Kyokugenryu dojos to Ryo. At least two dojos are still active, one near Southtown and one is later entrusted to Ryo's student, Marco Rodriguez. This is supported by the fact that Ryo uses the Mr. Karate mantle that his father once held in Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition and Buriki One.</p><h2>The King of Fighters</h2><p>The King of Fighters series was inspired by the fact that Ryo appeared in Fatal Fury Special as a secret final boss. Much of the appeal for the first game, KOF 94, was so that characters from both Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting can fight together and against one another. The story was retconned to make the characters from both FF and AOF appear around the same age, although KOF is separate from their respective series. Despite both protagonists having only support roles in the series, Ryo and Terry are friendly rivals. This is shown through special intros, official art and game openings.</p><p>Throughout KOF, The Kyoukugenryu is portrayed as a struggling family business, being funded by the prize money earned from KOF tournaments and Robert's vast wealth. Every year, after the conclusion of each KOF tournament, because of their strong performance, the Kyokugen dojo would have many applicants. However, because of the harsh training program or mysterious people who appear and trash the dojo, most of the applicants would quit, despite their hard fought success. The family is still running two dojos. One in South town and another in Mexico.</p><p>Ryo teams up with Robert, Yuri or Takuma to spread the fame of the Kyokugen style. He tries to keep his sister away from entering the KOF tournaments and gives in to his father's demands. He invited King to the team in KOF 2000, despite Robert's protests. Takuma observed (and sort of mistaken) the respect the young fighters had for one another and wants King to join the team whenever the time calls for it. In KOF XI, Ryo points out that his student, Marco is right now a green belt.</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Ryo is both serious when it comes to fighting and loyal to his family and friends. Thanks to the martial arts training that he earned from his father, he has been given discipline. Although they're best friends, Ryo treats Robert as his rival. He is a little old fashioned and less intense, which separates him from his trendy sister, Yuri and his stylish rival, Robert. He admits to not being very intelligent and well talented, however, he believes that theses are the two obstacles for him to overcome. Ryo thinks he can achieve excellence in his art by hard work and experience compared to Yuri and Robert's training ideologies. Because he raised both himself and Yuri, he is struggling by his wish to protect his sister and his other wish to see her grow up. He accepts her growing maturity without being against it.</p><p>It is suggested that there is a romantic tension between Ryo and King. He suddenly thinks of her as a good friend, despite King thinking more of Ryo since he provided helping in her brother's recovery in AOF2. Their relationship is referred to many times throughout the KOF series.</p><h2>Profile</h2><p>Full name: Ryo Sakazaki</p><p>Birth date: August 2nd</p><p>Birthplace: <a href=\"/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a></p><p>Height: 179 cm (5'10.5\")</p><p>Weight: 75 kg (165 lbs)</p><p>Blood type: O</p><p>Family/Relatives:</p><ul><li>Takuma Sakazaki (father)</li><li>Ronnet Sakazaki (mother, deceased)</li><li><a href=\"/yuri-sakazaki/29-62621/\">Yuri Sakazaki</a> (sister)</li><li>King (love interest)</li></ul><p>Job/Occupation: Dojo owner and master</p><p>Likes: The motorcycle he rebuilt himself, Tatsumaki (the horse he received)</p><p>Dislikes: Pickles, bugs with a lot of legs</p><p>Hobbies: DIY carpentry, growing vegetables at home</p><p>Favorite food: Rice cakes, fermented soybeans</p><p>Forte in sports: Sumo wrestling</p><p>Favorite music: Country music</p><h2>Powers</h2><ul><li><b>Chi Gathering</b> - Ryo can gather ki from Gaia, the mother-earth.</li><li><b>Energy Projectile</b> - Ryo can fire the Kouken and Haoh Shou Kouken blast normally.</li><li><b>Multiple Attacks</b> - Ryo can channel his ki energy into his arms to deliver multiple punches at a very fast ratio.</li></ul><h2>Fighting Style</h2><p>Kyokugenryu Karate</p><h2>Video game appearances</h2><p><b>Art of Fighting</b></p><li><b>Art of Fighting 2</b></li><li><b>Art of Fighting 3: The Path of The Warrior</b></li><li><b>Art of Fighting Anthology</b></li><li><b>Fatal Fury Special</b></li><li><b>Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 94</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 94: Re-bout</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 95</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 96</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 97</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 98</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 99</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters: The Dream Match 1999</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters: Evolution</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters EX: Neo Blood</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters EX2: Howling Blood</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters R-1</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters R-2</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2000</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2001</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2002: Challenge to Ultimate Battle</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2002: Unlimited Match</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2003</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters 2006</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters XI</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters XII</b></li><li><b>King of Fighters XIII</b></li><li>King of Fighters Kyo</li><li>King of Fighters: Maximum Impact</li><li>King of Fighters: Neowave</li><li>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000</li><li>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</li><li>Capcom vs SNK2: Mark of Millennium</li>", "deck": "The Master of Kyokugenryu Karate, Ryo Sakazaki is the protagonist of Art of Fighting and one of the main characters of the King of Fighters, with both fighting game series belonging to SNK.

He was close friends with a Franciscan monk, Brother Francis Martier, who was himself a keen flyer. Martier invented a revolutionary new plane, but died during its testing. The plane was left to Davy, as was a uniform that had allegedly been in Martier's family for over a century. Wearing the costume and flying the plane left to him, Davy became Airboy. &nbsp;<br /><h2>Creation</h2>Airboy was created by <a href=\"/charles-biro/26-1351/\">Charles Biro</a>, <a href=\"/dick-wood/26-59911/\">Dick Wood</a> and <a href=\"/al-camy/26-48497/\">Al Camy</a>. He was updated for the Modern Age by <a href=\"/timothy-truman/26-15861/\">Timothy Truman</a>, <a href=\"/chuck-dixon/26-41486/\">Chuck Dixon</a> and <a href=\"/stan-woch/26-25603/\">Stan Woch</a>. &nbsp;<br /><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age&nbsp;</h3>In the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age</a>, Davy was a young boy who fought in the Second World War. The Golden Age also witnessed the introduction of most of his major supporting characters and villains, including <a href=\"/valkyrie/29-47056/\">Valkyrie</a>, a <a href=\"/germany/34-55777/\">German</a> pilot and later ally and love interest. Unusually for a comic book character, Davy aged more or less in real time.&nbsp;<br /><h3>Modern Age</h3>In the <a href=\"/modern-age-of-comics/12-56028/\">Modern Age</a>, the role of Airboy is played by David Nelson III, the son of the original Airboy. Many members of his supporting cast were brought forward in time.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>World War II&nbsp;</h3>Airboy fights as an independent operator on the side of the Allies during the Second World War. During this time he fights numerous supervillains, including Misery, <a href=\"/the-heap/29-30639/\">Heap</a> and Valkyrie<br /><h3>After the War&nbsp;</h3>Following the conclusion of the war, Davy spends some time acting as a pilot and mercenary. Eventually he retires to <a href=\"/california/34-55716/\">California</a>, where he raises his son, David Nelson III, and runs an aircraft manufacturing company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><h3>The New Airboy &nbsp;</h3>Davy is assassinated by South American mercenaries, which prompts his son to investigate. His son discovers his father's history as Airboy, as well as locating his plane and costume. The boy takes up the mantle of Airboy and continues his father's tradition of adventuring and crime fighting.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2>Davy is a very talented pilot, capable of flying most aircraft. He possesses a semi-sentient plane with a revolutionary flapping wing design, referred to affectionately as \"Birdie\". He is a competent hand-to-hand fighter and capable with some weaponry.

The second and sickly child to <a href=\"../../elizabeth-howlett/29-44325/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Elizabeth</a> and <a href=\"../../howlett-senior/29-44326/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> John Howlett Sr.</a> His mother was ill and, in the early 1900s, a young Irish girl named <a href=\"../../rose/29-44342/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Rose O'Hara</a> was brought to the Howlett estate to be a friend and a caretaker to young James. Together they befriended a young boy named <a href=\"../../dog-logan/29-44327/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Dog</a>, son of the grounds keeper, <a href=\"../../thomas-logan/29-44323/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Thomas Logan</a>. Dog tried to form a normal bond between the two, but due to his father\u2019s drunken abuse, he grew to resent the pair and plotted with his father against them. After a botched robbery turns into a successful murder, young James\u2019 powers suddenly manifest and he stabs Thomas with his newly drawn claws, also slashing Dog across the face before fainting. He and Rose flee the house and make their way through the harsh Canadian wilderness with James near-catatonic and Rose having to facilitate their transportation.</p><p>They arrive at a mine where Rose gives false names, calling James \u201cLogan.\u201d The other workers dub the revived Logan \u201cthe wolverine\u201d because of his penchant for tenaciously digging and begin to accept him as one of their own due to his incredible work ethic. What they don\u2019t know is that by night, he runs in the wild with a pack of wolves that he is cowed the alpha of. Dog arrives one day, having survived his encounter years ago, still holding a massive grudge against Logan. Logan recognizes his erstwhile friend and accepts his challenge to a brawl to the death. Before Logan can kill Dog, however, Rose tries to pull him away and is inadvertently stabbed through the chest, killing her and leaving Logan to mourn alone.</p><h2><b>Creation</b></h2><p>At the time of his creation comics were becoming increasingly popular in Canada and <a href=\"/roy-thomas/26-42067/\"> Roy Thomas,</a> Marvel's then Editor-in-Chief, suggested to <a href=\"/len-wein/26-41457/\"> Len Wein</a> to create a Canadian character to put in the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\"> Hulk</a> comic he was working on. The two of them ironed out details such as the name (which came down to two options--1. The Badger and 2. The Wolverine) and based details of their new character around the characteristics of the Wolverine. <a href=\"/john-romita/26-7499/\"> John Romita, Sr.</a> was then brought on to design the character, once again using the animal as the basis for the character, making him short and stocky and introducing claws to both the character and in the motif of his costume. Wolverine was first drawn for publication by <a href=\"/herb-trimpe/26-3439/\"> Herb Trimpe</a>. Wolverine's mask was drawn incorrectly by <a href=\"/gil-kane/26-1764/\"> Gil Kane</a> for the cover of Giant-Size X-Men #1, but <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\"> Dave Cockrum</a>, who penciled the comic, liked it so much that he incorporated it into his own artwork for the actual story.</p><h2><b>Character Evolution</b></h2><h3><b>Early Years of Wolverine</b>\n</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"809397\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/809397-silver_fox1.jpg\" title=\"Silver Fox died \"><img id=\"809397\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/809397-silver_fox1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Silver Fox died \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Silver Fox died </div></div></div></div>\n<p>In 1910, Logan traveled to another frontier community in the Canadian Rockies and met a young Blackfoot woman named <a href=\"../../silver-fox/29-15696/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Silver Fox</a>, with whom he falls in love. She reciprocates, and the two share a cabin together in the woods and live happily for a time. In late May, when Logan believed his birthday to be, <a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sabretooth</a> tracks and murders Silver Fox after seeing her and Wolverine together, envious that Logan had found a measure of peace. Upon discovering the gruesome scene, Wolverine flew into a rage and battles Sabretooth, but couldn\u2019t best his counterpart, who was able to keep his cool.</p><p>Sabretooth and a mysterious cloaked figure then manipulated the feral, mindless Logan to slaughter the inhabitants of the town he had been living in at the time.</p><p>Later, employed by The Hudson's Bay Company as a fur trader to the Blackfoot Indians, he defeated the demonic snake-worm known as Uncegila, a feat which earned him the Blackfoot warrior name of \"Skunk-Bear.\" A broad, largely unseen conspiracy then began to shape Logan, robbed of his conscience and free will, into the perfect killer. Wherever Logan went, <a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sabretooth</a> or one of his handlers, was not far behind.</p><h3><b>World War I</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1863610\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1863610-logan_wwi_super.jpg\" title=\"Logan in the Great War\"><img id=\"1863610\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1863610-logan_wwi_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Logan in the Great War\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Logan in the Great War</div></div></div></div><p>In 1914, Logan joined the Canadian Army to fight during The Great War. During a battle in Belgium on April 22, 1915, Logan encountered <a href=\"../../lazaer/29-45746/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Lazaer</a> (anagram of Azrael, the Angel of Death) for the first time and a fight ensued. Lazaer got the upper hand and impaled Wolverine with his sword, but Logan pulled the sword from his body, and impaled Lazaer to defeat him. Since then, every time Logan has had a near death experience, he has had to battle Lazaer so that he is able to return back to the realm of the living and use his advanced healing factor to return to health.</p><p>When the authorities became aware of Logan's abilities, he was assigned to a special unit of the Canadian military, The Devil's Brigade, tasked with the most suicidal missions in the war under the command of the super-humanly strong Silas Burr (who later became the mercenary Cyber). After a falling out, Cyber murdered Logan's girlfriend and during the confrontation Logan was severely beaten and one of his eyes was removed, but he was able to escape. Cyber and Sabretooth tracked him at the bidding of Romulus and returned him to the squad where he was assigned to Madripoor.</p><h3>Post-World War I</h3><p>After a stint in the small nation, Logan traveled to China where he turned down an offer from the warlord Ogun to instruct him in the Art of War. But Logan was a man ever on the move, this time finding himself in South America where he ran across Mystique for the first time. The two of them were going to be executed by firing squad, but escaped using their abilities and formed a small criminal syndicate. Wolverine and Mystique became romantically involved, but the relationship was short lived as Logan reported on their criminal doings to the police, thus sending the syndicate to prison and returning to Canada to take part in the Weapon X program.</p><h3><b>World War II</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872411\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872411-wolverine16_super.jpg\" title=\"Fighting against the Nazis\"><img id=\"1872411\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872411-wolverine16_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting against the Nazis\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fighting against the Nazis</div></div></div></div><p>During World War II, Logan teamed up with <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Captain America</a> and <a href=\"../../bucky-barnes/29-40470/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bucky</a> Barnes in <a href=\"../../madripoor/34-42665/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Madripoor</a>. The two were unaware of his mutation, believing him to merely be extraordinarily lucky, and dubbed him \u201cLucky James.\u201d One of their first significant missions was to rescue <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Natasha Romanova</a>, a young child at the time, from being brainwashed into an assassin by <a href=\"../../the-hand/65-1800/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> The Hand</a>. Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker was also implicated, causing Cap and Bucky\u2019s attention to shift to the fascist HYDRA organization. During this time, Seraph, guardian of Madripoor and another ex-lover of Wolverine, was killed by <a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sabretooth</a>, presumably under the orders of a strange entity called Romulus. But whom he was would not be revealed until years later. Logan decided to officially get involved in the war and enlisted in the Armed Forces, joining the First Canadian Parachute Battalion. It was with this battalion that he first encountered <a href=\"../../bloodscream/29-15734/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Bloodscream</a>, an immortal being with vampire-like qualities and powers. He fought in various missions, already soon making a name for himself as one of the best soldiers in the division. He ended his stint living in Japan.</p><h3><b>After the War</b></h3><p>After WWII, Logan returned to Japan, having remembered Ogun's offer to train him. Logan would soon develop a deep love of Japan, particularly samurai culture and code of Bushido, that would stand the test of time. His training complete, he journeyed across the nation until he met the beautiful Itsu, with whom he started a family. But Logan\u2019s destiny was never one of peace, and after he accidentally killed a man during a disaster, he returned home to find Itsu dead and the child they conceived stolen by Romulus. Logan had nothing left in Japan and returned to Canada to once again join with Weapon X. It was then that he gained his trademark adamantium skeleton, but also lost his memory due to the trauma of the experiment before joining Alpha Flight and taking on the Hulk for the first time.</p><h3>Team X</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872413\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872413-509659_logan_team_x_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1872413\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872413-509659_logan_team_x_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>After his military duty and his return from Japan and his training there, Logan applied for the job of Special Agent for an American underground government organization. With extreme coincidence, Logan's mortal enemy Sabretooth turned out to have applied for the same 'job'. A fight erupted in the offices of the organization, but both were subdued. At this time it turned out, it was not just a normal organization where the two had come to. They were both given a memory wipe and had false memories implanted. All except for Logan's time in Japan was a complete mystery to him, and Logan had no recollection of his former feud with Sabretooth. He fought on various missions together with teammates <a href=\"../../maverick/29-8307/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Maverick</a> and <a href=\"../../john-wraith/29-3205/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> John Wraith</a>. It was during one of these missions that Logan first met and fought <a href=\"../../omega-red/29-9729/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Omega Red</a>.</p><p>False memories were given to Logan and his teammates after most missions, so they would not, or only partly remember what they had done or what their objective had been. After some time, Sabretooth's brutal ways became an eyesore to the other team members and it was not before long that the team had an internal conflict, resulting in a breakup of the team and Sabretooth leaving. Logan's missions for Team X seemed done, but his long road of suffering would just be at the beginning.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3><u><b>Weapon X</b></u></h3><p>After Logan's missions with Team X, a few heads turned with interest to Logan. During some point in his career as a special operative, Logan was kidnapped by agents of the Weapon X (or Plus) Program, a joint U.S./Canadian program. He was taken to a facility in the Canadian woods where he was examined by Professor Thorton, <a href=\"../../dr-cornelius/29-9393/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Dr. Abraham Cornelius</a>, and Carol Hines. The Professor learned that Logan possessed a mutant healing factor and would be able to sustain the installation of <a href=\"../../adamantium/18-40759/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Adamantium</a> onto his bones, as the procedure would kill any other person. In this, they attempted to build the perfect living weapon.</p><p>The procedure was performed, and Logan now had a skeleton completely laced with the hard metal. This included his claws, which were now razor sharp claws that could cut through anything. During his time with Weapon X, Logan was heavily sedated and controlled through a helmet, giving him false memories and turned him into sort of a puppet for the Program. He was even forced to kill an entire town, wanting to test if Logan would do any assignment. His abilities were put to the test. Eventually, Logan was able to resist the mind-control and broke free from the facility (with help from the <a href=\"../../bucky-barnes/29-40470/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Winter Soldier</a>). Enraged and more beast then man, he killed nearly anyone who stood in his way. That was except for <a href=\"../../dr-cornelius/29-9393/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Professor Cornelius</a>, <a href=\"../../hines/29-15697/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hines</a>, and <a href=\"../../the-director/29-15621/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Malcolm Colcord</a>. These persons would all spell more trouble for Logan while the years went by.</p><h3>Department H</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872418\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872418-529944_wolverine161_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine vs. Hulk\"><img id=\"1872418\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872418-529944_wolverine161_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine vs. Hulk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine vs. Hulk</div></div></div></div><p>After his escape from the Weapon X program, Logan spent months in the Canadian wilderness until he was found by James Hudson (aka <a href=\"../../guardian/29-5047/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Guardian</a>) and Heather Hudson (aka <a href=\"../../vindicator/29-5009/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Vindicator</a>). The two of them were scientist and super-powered humans who worked for a division of the Canadian Government named Department H. Logan was soon brought back to good mental health, and also started working for the government (not remembering much of his time in Weapon X or what happened before that period). He participated in a few missions for Department H and was even given a costume and secret identity; the Wolverine. Logan's most prominent mission was when he was asked to locate, and subdue the incredible Hulk. The Hulk was spotted in a Canadian forest, and Wolverine seemed to be the best operative to engage the \"Green Goliath\". He was dropped into the mission zone by Department H and soon found the Hulk, who at the time was fighting the Wendigo.</p><p>Wolverine, knowing it would be difficult to fight against both of them, first pretended to team up with the Hulk against the Wendigo, but turned on him the moment they defeated the creature. Logan started a brutal fight against the Green giant, and fought for a long period of time, but the two seemed evenly matched. When it took too long, Wolverine was told to abort the mission and return to the helicopter, his ride back to Department H. During this time, Professor Charles Xavier found out about Wolverine being a mutant and started to watch him more closely.</p><h3><b>Wolverine in the X-Men</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872419\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872419-wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Meeting Jean Grey\"><img id=\"1872419\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872419-wolverine_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Jean Grey\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Meeting Jean Grey</div></div></div></div><p>Wolverine first came into contact with the X-men when Professor Xavier contacted the Canadian government to arrange a personal introduction. Knowing full well that Department H was exploiting Logan for their own purposes and that there was friction between Wolverine and his superiors, Professor X offered Wolverine a position with the X-Men on the spot. The Department official objected but Logan lashed out at him and accepted Xavier's offer to join his school and team. Unbeknownst to Logan, he had been released from the Department intentionally with implanted subliminal orders to assassinate Professor Xavier. Xavier was fully aware of this, however, and simply removed the implanted suggestion from Logan's mind. He promised to help Logan with his memory loss in exchange for his enrollment on the X-Men roster.</p><p>Logan joined simultaneously with a number of new X-Men from across the globe, including <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Nightcrawler</a>, <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Banshee</a>, <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Storm</a>, <a href=\"../../sunfire/29-3175/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Sunfire</a>, <a href=\"../../thunderbird/29-2174/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Thunderbird</a>, and <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Colossus</a>. Scott Summers (aka <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cyclops</a>) was already established as the leader of the team, but Logan caused immediate problems in their working relationship by bucking his authority and questioning his leadership of the team. The mission for which Logan and his fellow team members were recruited was an attempt to save the original X-Men team from the living island of <a href=\"../../krakoa/29-26409/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Krakoa</a>. Following the successful mission, Logan (as well as many of the other new X-men) clashed with the original X-Men. In one such instance, Warren Worthington III (aka <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\"> Angel</a>) noticed Logan flirting with X-Man <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\"> Jean Grey</a> out in the yard. Feeling that Logan was out of line, a fight between the two X-Men almost ensued but Jean intervened. This was the beginning of a longstanding romantic tension between Logan and Jean Grey, although she remained in a committed relationship with Cyclops until her untimely death. Despite this tension with Logan, Jean and Cyclops were the only two original X-Men to remain with the team immediately after.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><p>In a later mission, Wolverine and the other X-Men were taken captive by the newly returned <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\"> Sentinels</a>, giant robots whose main objective was to capture or kill mutants. The captives were taken into outer space to be imprisoned on a space station but managed to escape and return to earth via stolen space-shuttle. This proved catastrophic when the shuttle began to break up and Jean volunteered to fly the space-jet back to earth, risking exposure to cosmic rays. The shuttle reached Earth safely and crash landed in the Hudson river. Wolverine and the other X-Men managed to get off the sinking space shuttle, but feared for Jean's life. She burst from the water in a fantastic display of telekinetic power, seemingly born anew.</p><p>At the time the X-Men accepted this person as their own Jean Grey, but in reality it was a cosmic entity known as the <a href=\"../../phoenix-force/29-2164/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Phoenix</a> who had taken her place, copying Jean's body, personality, and memories and leaving the real Jean comatose in a cocoon on the bottom of the Hudson river. After the incident, the X-Men and the ersatz Jean performed various missions together, including facing down the mad Emperor <a href=\"../../dken/29-40902/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> D'Ken</a> of the <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\"> Shi'ar</a> <a href=\"/shiar-empire/34-23199/\"> Empire</a> who sought to rule or destroy the entire universe. During this mission the X-Men fought the Shi'ar <a href=\"/imperial-guard/65-6097/\"> Imperial Guard</a> on the surface of Earth's moon. In this fight, Logan faced and defeated a member of the Guard named <a href=\"../../fang/29-6090/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Fang</a>, briefly wearing the guardsman's costume after his own was torn. The X-men defeated the Shi'ar, deposed D'ken, and put the fallen Emperor's sister, <a href=\"../../lilandra/29-6144/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Lilandra</a>, on the throne in his place.</p><p>After the team returned home, Logan's former friend and Alpha Flight teammate the Guardian turned up unannounced and attacked the team in an attempt to bring Logan back to Canada, no matter the cost. He was defeated and sent back to Canada empty handed. The Guardian would try to recapture Logan again, this time with the help of Alpha Flight, but once again Wolverine evaded capture and remained with the X-Men, seemingly unconcerned that he was wanted by the Canadian government. During this time Logan began to develop close personal connections with his teammates that were uncommon for him. He grew especially close with Colossus, Storm, and Nightcrawler.</p><p>Logan even seemed to develop a friendly relationship with Xavier whereas before he'd repeatedly rebelled against authority figures, although Logan still annoyed Xavier by insisting on referring to him with nicknames such as \"Chuck\" and \"Charlie\" rather than as \"Professor Xavier\" or even the more casual \"Charles.\" However, his relationship with \"Jean\" remained at an impasse as she continued to be devoted to Cyclops. Logan and the X-Men faced numerous threats during this time, and on one of these missions they traveled to Japan where Logan met and fell in love with a young Japanese woman named <a href=\"../../mariko-yashida/29-3196/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Mariko Yashida</a>, abandoning his pursuit of the unresponsive Jean. After this mission, Logan often returned to Japan to visit Mariko and continue their courtship.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872673\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine meeting Mariko\"><img id=\"1872673\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872673-mariko_yashida__earth_616__super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine meeting Mariko\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine meeting Mariko</div></div></div></div><p>Some missions later, disaster struck when the being posing as Jean, now openly calling herself the Phoenix, was manipulated by the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\"> Hellfire Club</a>, a mutant organization bent on world domination. She was taken hostage and subjected to mental manipulation by <a href=\"/mastermind/29-8306/\"> Mastermind</a>, transforming her into the Dark Phoenix, an entity with no remorse who fought with the Hellfire Club instead of against them. The X-men tried to rescue her, but all were captured save Wolverine. Working alone, Logan fought his way through Hellfire Club soldiers, injuring many. Just as he successfully rescued the X-Men, the Dark Phoenix suddenly became extremely unstable. Now out of the control of even the Hellfire Club, she flew out of the Club's building in a rage and traveled to deep space, where she consumed an entire populated planet in her primal hunger.</p><p>After this horrific event, the Phoenix regained her normal \"Jean\" personality but remained highly unstable. This atrocity convinced the rulers of the Shi'ar Empire that the Phoenix, an entity that had been previously known to them, had to be destroyed, which meant killing Jean. The X-men refused to surrender their teammate and fought for her life against the Shi'ar Imperial Guard once more on the dark side of Earth's moon. The Guard was winning the battle until the Phoenix fought back with her full might and in a burst of power knocked out almost the entire Guard, nearly killing them. After that, the \"Jean\" persona took control of the Phoenix and decided she was too far out of control and too dangerous to be left alive. She intentionally walked into the path of an automated laser cannon, allowing herself to be vaporized. The X-men were devastated by her death, especially Cyclops and Logan, who had not moved past his desire for Jean as much as he'd let on. Cyclops decided to quit the team immediately after, leaving Storm to lead, but Wolverine stayed with the X-Men.</p><h3>Further Adventures</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2158133\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108904/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Do not mess with him\"><img id=\"2158133\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108904/2158133-1872431_20134_3157_22463_1_wolverine_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Do not mess with him\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Do not mess with him</div></div></div></div><p>After Jean had died, hope came back to the X-men and Wolverine in the form of young Kitty Pryde. An uptown girl with the mutant ability to face through any solid matter. As time went on, Wolverine became somewhat of a mentor to her, although she first found him to be scary. Cyclops returned during this time, with a new girlfriend named <a href=\"../../madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Madelyne Pryor</a> and took leadership of the X-men once again. Logan and the X-men soon found themselves in more trouble when space-pirates named the Starjammers (whom they had encountered during their mission against the Shi'ar) asked for their help. The team went into outer space to help, but where captured by the alien race known as the Brood. Some of the X-men, including Wolverine, where implanted by a Brood egg, which would change it's host into another Brood. Logan managed to break free from captivity and his healing factor prevented the egg from hatching and killed the creature inside him.</p><p>After the X-men defeated the Brood, they managed to return home once again. Only problem was that they had remained in space for a long time. During this time, Xavier thought the X-men to be dead. Xavier, (whom himself also got infected with a Brood egg by a Brood whom had traveled to earth) assembled a new team of mutants calling them 'the New Mutants'. When the X-men returned, the found strange people living inside their home, and a fight erupted until they found out that it where the New Mutants and that they where no longer the youngest team of X-men. The Brood Xavier had however hatched by this time, and though the X-men and the New Mutants. They did defeat it, but the transformation to Brood and back took its toll on Xavier, he became very sick. For Logan however, things looked brighter than it had been in a long time. He had recently proposed to Mariko, his girlfriend from Japan and she agreed to wed him.</p><p>Wolverine had invited all his X-men friends on the day of the wedding, but just before they wanted to say the 'I do', Mariko walked up to Logan and told him she did not love him. Logan was stunned, and above all, heartbroken. It turned out that this was not Mariko's own decision, but Mastermind's manipulating her, he was an old enemy to the X-men. Wolverine fell into a deep angry mood. He however found some new excitement when ex-criminal and former enemy Rogue joined the X-men. He had fought her once before in which she nearly killed him, but now she came to the X-men in search of help to control her powers, and wanting to change her life. Almost nobody believed her, but Wolverine felt less mistrustful towards her and he took Rogue on a trip to Japan. There the two strangely enough soon become friends. She returned as a fully respected X-woman. Around the same time, the spirit of Wolverine's old Martial Arts trainer Ogun had taken an interest in Kitty Pryde. Kitty had gone to Japan in search of her father, but soon found herself mind-controlled by Ogun, whom trained and manipulated her from beyond the grave.</p><p>Eventually, Wolverine managed to bring Kitty out of her trance and together they managed to stop Ogun, after which they returned to America. Wolverine and the other X-men then entered the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Secret Wars</a>. Upon their return they where teleported to Japan and opposed a huge green dragon who ravaged the city. A building came down and a woman was mortally wounded. Wolverine rushed to her, hoping to save her, but it was already to late. With her dying breath she asked Logan to look after her daughter <a href=\"../../amiko/29-4992/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Amiko</a>, to which Logan gave her his promise. He became the foster-father to Amiko, and visits her as often as he can, but Logan gave her a home in Japan with his good friend and former lover <a href=\"../../yukio/29-9843/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Yukio</a>. Back in the United States, things went downhill for Charles Xavier. With a body that had to get back to health, Xavier remained very fragile. During a court-session in which former arch enemy Magneto stood trail, Xavier collapsed during a fight and could only be saved if given medical care from the Shi'ar. Xavier left and Magneto became mentor to the New Mutants, and teammate to Wolverine and the X-men at the same time. Many team-members did not trust Magneto, including Logan. Cyclops even left the team with his wife <a href=\"../../madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Madelyne Pryor</a> and his newborn son, started X-factor and left Storm in charge. However, they soon began trusting Magneto, becoming allies and even friends.</p><h3>Mutant Massacre</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872464\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872464-2605_4_0207_super.jpg\" title=\"Classic Wolverine\"><img id=\"1872464\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872464-2605_4_0207_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Classic Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Classic Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p>Wolverine and the X-men soon met their greatest threat yet, in the form of the mutant hunting <a href=\"../../marauders/65-40480/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Marauders</a>. Under the tunnels of Manhattan lived the Morlocks, an underground civilization of mutants. Storm had become their leader after she had bested their former leader Callisto. The X-men where alerted by a giant \"mole like' Morlock whom stormed into the yard of Xavier' school. With his dying breath he told them of a slaughter going on in the tunnels by a group of hunters. The X-men soon went underground and into the tunnels. What they found was a large number of dead Morlocks. It was not soon before they found the Marauders and fought them, with heavy casualties. Colossus could not change back to his human form, Kitty stayed in her facing form (becoming much like a ghost) and Kurt was injured as well.</p><p>The X-men found out that they were not alone in the tunnels, Cyclops' team, X-factor was also fighting the Marauders with their own dramatic consequences (the former X-men Angel lost his wings). The X-men returned to the school with their casualties, but Wolverine went back in to the tunnels to fight. There he first encountered the child super-team <a href=\"../../power-pack/65-40498/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Power Pack</a>. He was just about to tell them to leave the tunnels when he came eye in eye with Sabretooth. He noticed that Sabretooth had been slaughtering many more Morlocks, and was about to kill and old Morlock man with the gift to heal almost any injury, named the <a href=\"../../healer/29-13365/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Healer</a>. Logan knew how valuable the Healer could be in treating all the wounded Morlocks and got Sabretooth to let him go by saying \"your fighting old men now, is that the best you can do or wanna try fighting against a real challenge\" namely, himself. His plan worked and a brutal fight erupted with Wolverine coming out victorious.</p><p>The Morlocks seemed to be saved from more harm, but not a few days later, Sabretooth re-emerged. He fought against Elizabeth Braddock, known as Psylocke, a new recruit to the X-men. She managed to hold him off long enough for Wolverine to arrive and finally making an end to the thread, pushing him of a cliff and into the water. For now, the mutants where saved. But the threat was far from over. While Cyclops seemed to have vanished, he left his wife <a href=\"../../madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Madelyne Pryor</a> and his son unprotected for the Marauders who where now attacking here. The X-men luckily where hot on their trail and saved Madelyne from certain death and they managed to defeat the Marauders at the same time. Madelyne then joined the team, she and Wolverine soon became good friends, with Logan calling her \"Maddy\". The X-men's next mission was in Dallas, Texas. It ended with the X-men giving their lives up in order to defeat an incredible thread called the Advisory. All the X-men (except for the still injured and absent Kitty Pryde and Nightcrawler) seemingly sacrificed their lives. However, nothing was further from the truth. Gaia, the Goddess of Earth saved the lives of the X-men, because they still had great things to do. The X-men however decided to keep a low profile, letting everybody think they had died, even to their own teammates Kitty and Nightcrawler.</p><h3>Wolverine in Australia</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872810\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872810-1868167_uncanny_x_men__1963__251_super_super.jpeg\" title=\"Crossed\"><img id=\"1872810\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872810-1868167_uncanny_x_men__1963__251_super_thumb.jpeg\" alt=\"Crossed\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Crossed</div></div></div></div><p>Right after Wolverine's mission in Texas, they fought a criminal group of cyborgs called the Reavers out of their base, a deserted Australian desert town and made it their own headquarters. On top of a mountain near the village was an Aboriginal mutant named Gateway, whom teleported the X-men to where ever they wanted to go. They had various missions, including a second encounter against the Brood and they the team uncovered the horrible truth about mutants that were used as slaves on the island nation of Genosha. After this the events of Inferno took place. The leader behind the Marauders, Mister Sinister made himself known. He turned out be to be the creator of Madelyne, who was a clone of Jean Grey. Through mind-control and Madelyne's sincere anger towards Cyclops for leaving her and her baby, she became the evil <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\"> Goblin Queen</a>.</p><p>Although Logan tried to reason with Madelyne, the battle that followed left Madelyne dead, and the X-men feeling defeated. Logan however did find out that Jean Grey, whom was believed dead for many years, was alive and working with X-factor from the beginning. Upon completion of a mission the X-Men teleported to their headquarters but unbeknownst to everybody, a girl named <a href=\"../../jubilee/29-4562/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Jubilee</a> followed Wolverine into the portal and remained hidden in their headquarters for some time. Feeling lost and wanting to quit the lives they once led, the X-men all went through a portal that erased their memories and scattered them around the earth. All except for Wolverine. He was attacked by the returned <a href=\"/reavers/65-9726/\"> Reavers</a> group whom tried to reclaim their base. Being the only X-Men member left, Logan was defeated, nailed to a cross and left for dead. It was not until then that Jubilee made herself known. She rescued Logan by helping him off the iron X-shaped cross and they fled.</p><h3>Patch</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872428\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Patch\"><img id=\"1872428\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872428-135767_193299_wolverine_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Patch\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Patch</div></div></div></div><p>With Jubilee as his only companion, Logan set out to search for the other X-Men. He did so with his undercover identity and alias known as \"Patch\". The first X-(wo)man he found was <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\"> Psylocke</a>. But not the British Psylocke Logan knew, now she was transformed into an Asian ninja by the cult known as the <a href=\"/the-hand/65-1800/\"> Hand.</a> Logan helped her to get rid of the Hand influence, and although she did regain her own consciousness, she remained more aggressive then before and kept her Asian looks. They soon found other X-Men such as <a href=\"/dazzler/29-1498/\"> Dazzler</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\"> Colossus</a> and <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\"> Storm</a> (whom had been reduced to a child and was under the guidance of a new mutant named Gambit), but many didn't return and so the team remained scattered for a longer period of time. The first real mission with a hand full of X-Men led by Wolverine, combined with <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\"> X-Factor</a> and the <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\"> New Mutants,</a> was against the Genoshian Government, which they then over-through.</p><p>During this fight, Logan was reunited with Jean in a holding cell and shared an intimate moment. The remaining X-Men were shocked when Professor Charles Xavier seemed to have returned to Earth after being away for many years with the <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\"> Shi'ar.</a> It however turned out to be an imposter and the real Xavier was being held prisoner by some rogue Shi'ar agents. Wolverine found out about this, but shocked teammates and enemies by stabbing the Xavier imposter in the chest. After the rogue Shi'ar had been defeated, the team went back home but encountered an evil entity known as the Shadow King fairly soon. He turned members of the X-Men against each other, resulting in a fight between Wolverine and <a href=\"/gambit/29-1499/\"> Gambit</a>. The situation resulted in the Shadow King being defeated, Xavier returning to the X-Men, as well as the X-Factor team of <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\"> Beast</a>, <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\"> Cyclops</a>, Jean, <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\"> Iceman</a> and <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\"> Archangel</a> returning to the fault. Although not credited, Wolverine had been the one main reason that the team survived this very difficult time.</p><h3>Return of the Team</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872460\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872460-76390_43694_x_men_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The X-Men: Blue Team\"><img id=\"1872460\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872460-76390_43694_x_men_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The X-Men: Blue Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The X-Men: Blue Team</div></div></div></div><p>After Logan joined the newly reformed X-Men, things finally seemed to calm down. However, nothing was further from the truth. Old ally and friend, Magneto had gone back to his old ways, and when he brought up nuclear weapons from a submariner he once sunk, claiming to only use them for defensive purposes, the X-Men lost all trust in Magneto's good intentions. Magneto was furious that the X-Men did not understand that they were still his allies. A fight broke loose and Magneto was defeated. After his defeat, he told his former team-mates that next time, they would meet as enemies. Sometime after these events, Wolverine's past finally came back to haunt him.</p><p>During a day off, Wolverine, Gambit and Rogue where attacked and captured by an old enemy of Logan's; <a href=\"../../omega-red/29-9729/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Omega Red</a>. He had met Omega Red during his a mission as a secret agent with Team X (which included Sabretooth, John Wraith and <a href=\"../../maverick/29-8307/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Maverick</a>). Logan, however had no recollection of his past, and even when his former teammate Maverick came to help him and the X-Men break free, he still had trouble remembering who he was. This event however triggered Logan into looking into his past. He went back to the Weapon X labs with his X-Men friends. There, Logan started getting flashes of memories, re-living some of his most horrible memories. Logan was fully aware that not all of these memories where real, but he could not yet determine which was true, and which was false. During his visit at the laboratory, he even met a strange operative claiming to be <a href=\"../../silver-fox/29-15696/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Silver Fox</a>, his former lover. She told him that she had not died when Sabretooth attacked her, but joined the Weapon X program years later. Whether this claim was true or not remains to be seen. Logan finally started making some sense out of the wasteland that was his memory and was now happy to let the past rest. However, more trouble rose on the horizon.</p><h3>Losing the Adamantium</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1872420\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine_super.gif\" title=\"Bone Claws\"><img id=\"1872420\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/81501/1872420-357553_70338_wolverine_medium.gif\" alt=\"Bone Claws\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Bone Claws</div></div></div></div><p>During an encounter with <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\"> Magneto</a> on the space station <a href=\"/avalon/34-41283/\"> Avalon</a>, Wolverine cut Magneto with his claws. In retaliation, Magneto used the power of the magnetic field in space to tear the adamantium that laced Wolverine's skeleton out of his body. This cause extensive injuries, which shortened out Wolverine's healing factor for a while, and also revealed that Wolverine's claws, which he believed was a result of the Weapon X program, where in fact part of his actual bone structure. During this period, <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\"> Professor Xavier</a>, <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\"> Beast</a> and <a href=\"/heather-hudson/29-9846/\"> Heather Hudson</a> were conducting experiments on Wolverine. They discovered that Wolverine's mutation was actually ongoing and that whilst his healing factor and senses accelerated it would eventually cost him his humanity, for it would eventually change him into a feral, wild animal- like creature. It as also discovered that the presence of the adamantium slowed down his mutation as his healing factor was constantly trying to expel it.</p><h3><b>Phalanx Covenant</b></h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/phalanx-covenant/39-42176/\"> Phalanx Covenant</a></p><p>Because of the injuries he received, Wolverine left the X-Men team for a while and was asked by <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kitty</a> to make a visit to <a href=\"../../muir-island/34-43505/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Muir Island</a>, where he was attacked by <a href=\"../../cyber/29-7597/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cyber</a>. During the invasion of the Phalanx, Wolverine and <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cable</a> were requested by Professor Xavier to find and rescue the captured X-Men team. They joined up with Cyclops and Jean Grey, who had just come back from their honeymoon (and secretly the future) and with their help managed to free the X-Men in Tibet. After freeing the X-Men, Wolverine was kidnapped by <a href=\"/genesis/29-25193/\"> Tyler Dayspring</a>, who was going by the name Genesis. Tyler wanted to make Wolverine one of his new Horsemen so he acquired adamantium by destroying the body of the mercenary, Cyber and tried to recreate the bonding process used on Wolverine years ago. However, this time around Wolverine's body rejected the adamantium and he became feral. Wolverine managed to regain himself however, and he made his way back to the X-Men.</p><h3>Wolverine as Death, Horseman of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1895278\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1895278-death_wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine as Death\"><img id=\"1895278\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1895278-death_wolverine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine as Death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine as Death</div></div></div></div><p>After re-joining the X-Men team, Wolverine was kidnapped by the mutant <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\"> Apocalypse</a> and was forced to participate in a fight against Sabretooth for the place as one of Apocalypse's Horsemen, Death. With the knowledge that he may be able to resist the Apocalypse's programming and that with Sabretooth on his side, he would become very dangerous, Wolverine fought and defeated his nemesis. As a result of the fight, Wolverine's skeleton was laced with adamantium again and he fell under Apocalypse's control and became the third incarnation of the Horseman Death. While under the spell of Apocalypse, Wolverine attacked his X-Men team-mates and fought ferociously under his Death persona. However, Wolverine eventually regained himself after his team-mates helped him regain control of his personality and he broke free of Apocalypse's control.</p><h3><b>New X-Men and the Weapon Plus Program</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2027930\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/107470/2027930-newxmen_wolverine_super.jpg\" title=\"New X-Men Wolverine\"><img id=\"2027930\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/107470/2027930-newxmen_wolverine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"New X-Men Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">New X-Men Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p>Wolverine rejoined the X-Men as a faculty member of Professor Xavier's newly reconstituted School for Gifted Youngsters, settling into his role as the tough-but-fair mentor to a younger generation of mutants. This era was punctuated with intense conflict between the X-Men and a number of new threats, including the <a href=\"/u-men/65-47994/\"> U-Men</a>, a group of zealots who graft mutant body parts to themselves, and <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\"> Cassandra Nova</a>, a being of chaotic psychic energy and Charles Xavier's evil twin sister. The greatest of these conflicts for Wolverine came when he was contacted by <a href=\"/fantomex/29-4281/\"> Fantomex</a>, also known as Weapon XIII, a later iteration from the same program that gave Wolverine his adamantium skeleton and false memory implants. Unwittingly aided in his earlier escape by Professor Xavier and Jean Grey, Fantomex had tracked the <a href=\"/weapon-plus/65-40591/\"> Weapon Plus</a> program back to the place where he was created; a domed habitat known as the World. The World was an experimental structure where the program operators could control the flow of time, allowing them to create a new breed of superhumans in the blink of an eye by introducing evolutionary factors into the environment and speeding up time within to reap the results. Seeking answers about their respective pasts, Wolverine and Fantomex set out for The World with Cyclops in tow.</p><p>As the came across the structure, it was in the midst of a siege from without by <a href=\"/aim/65-13497/\"> AIM</a>, and from within by <a href=\"/ultimaton/29-41077/\"> Ultimaton</a> (Weapon XV), the latest product of the Weapon Plus super sentinel program. The trio found themselves at odds with both the AIM remnants and the bizarre machinations of the World itself. Following Ultimaton as he broke free from the World and headed into space, the team discovered the base of operations for the Weapon Plus program: an orbital station. It was here that Wolverine discovered how and why he was turned into a guinea pig all those years ago, as well as the lineage of the program going all the way back to the Super Soldier project that created Captain America. Faced with the truth of what he is, Wolverine set the station to blow up, taking the tragic legacy of the Weapon Plus project with it.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1903813\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1903813-jean_dies6_super.jpg\" title=\"The death of Jean Grey\"><img id=\"1903813\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1903813-jean_dies6_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The death of Jean Grey\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The death of Jean Grey</div></div></div></div><p>As the orbital station exploded, Jean Grey attempted to rescue Wolverine in a shuttle. Unfortunately for them, it was a trap sprung by the mutant known as <a href=\"/xorn/29-3183/\"> Xorn</a>, who was really Magneto in disguise. He had lured them to the Weapon Plus satellite, which turned out to be built using remnants of <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\"> Asteroid M</a>. With Wolverine and Jean trapped on board, Magneto flung the deteriorating station on a collision course with the sun. Wolverine was able to withstand the heat due to his healing factor, but Jean could not withstand the pain and asked Wolverine to kill her. In order to stop his love's pain Wolverine killed Jean with his claws. Jean's death unlocked the power of the Phoenix Force, which created a oxygen bubble around Wolverine, which helped him heal.</p><p>Wolverine and Jean returned to Earth and confronted Xorn, alongside the other members of the X-Men. However, when Jean confronted Xorn, he injected her with a lethal electromagnetic pulse and she died in Cyclops' arms. Wolverine mourned Jean's loss greatly and was displeased about Cyclops' new relationship with <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\"> Emma Frost</a> but still remained within the team, serving in many missions and even indulging in the occasional solo missions.</p><h3>Agent of Hydra and S.H.I.E.L.D.</h3><p>Wolverine is ambushed and attacked by the triumvirate comprising: the ninja group the <a href=\"/the-hand/65-1800/\"> Hand</a>, the criminal organization <a href=\"/hydra/65-3480/\"> Hydra</a>, and a mutant cult called \"Dawn of the White Light\"(then led by <a href=\"/gorgon/29-3777/\"> Gorgon</a>).

While in Japan, Wolverine seeks out the <a href=\"/silver-samurai/29-3174/\"> Silver Samurai</a>, who is the bodyguard of Japan's prime minister. After they battle each other and Wolverine beats Silver Samurai by cutting off his hand, he explains that Wolverine did not escape the Weapon X program by himself as Bucky, Captain America's partner known as the <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\"> Winter Soldier</a>, helped him break free. Wolverine travels to Serbia to find and confront Bucky, where he comes across the site of the original Weapon X program.

Suburo's village was surrounded by mountains which belonged to the demon sword-smith named <a href=\"/muramasa/29-50428/\"> Muramasa</a>. When Bucky murdered Itsu, Wolverine believed that the people of the village were responsible for her death. To get revenge against the people, Wolverine joined forces with Muramasa who then made the <a href=\"/muramasa-blades/18-54935/\"> Muramasa Blade</a>, the only weapon capable of killing Wolverine.</p><p>After remembering what transpired, Wolverine returns to Muramasa's mountains to find and reclaim the Muramasa Blade to excite vengeance on those who were responsible for manipulating him nearly his whole life. While Wolverine is searching for those responsible for the horrors in his past, he encounters <a href=\"/nuke/29-41866/\"> Nuke</a>, who has been sent to stop Wolverine. Wolverine feels guilty for taking down Nuke as her remembers that he is partially responsible for Nuke's creation as he was part of the reason he was created in the first place.

The Black Panther tells Logan of a theory that many animal-like mutants may have evolved from canine roots and not primates. He also told of a graveyard of these canine-descended beings Eventually, Sabretooth broke free and butchered Feral. Logan returned to the Xavier school to seek the <a href=\"../../muramasa-blades/18-54935/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Muramasa Blade</a> from Cyclops, retrieved it. Logan then tracked Sabretooth to the cabin that Logan had shared with Silver Fox. Sabretooth felt himself losing control and returning a wild state.

X-Force was relieved to find that he had been unable to make off with the sample.

Wolverines new school is located on a Krakoa which is an actual living island. The school itself is formed from Shi'ar technology and even has some parts of it that are floating in mid air. In the beginning of this series Wolverine and Kitty Pryde or attempting to get it as ready as possible for an inspection that will determine whether or not the school can remain open. Professor Xavier makes his first appearance after Schism and tells Logan that even though he never would have imagined that he would open his own school for mutants he could not think of anyone else better suited for the job and gives him his blessing. The master architect of Wolverines new school is none other than Beast himself. The major staff of the school includes Wolverine, Kitty Pryde, Rachel Grey, Iceman, Beast, Wolverine, Rogue, Chamber, Husk. The main goals of Wolverines new school is to keep the children away from the fighting at all costs and not turn them into living weapons but unfortunately a number of things occur that gets the children directly involved in a number of problems. Apparently, The new Hellfire Club was fully aware of the fact that Wolverine had built his school on top of a Krakoa. The new leader of the Hellfire club told Wolverine that he was the cause of the Sentinel attacking Utopia and driving the final wedge between his relationship with Cyclops. He also tells Wolverine that he will make it his personal mission to destroy the school. At that very moment the Krakoa begins to attack the students and to destroy a major part of the school. Fortunately, Wolverine and his team were able to put it down after a great showing of ability by Iceman's part who created ice clones of himself in order to combat the monstrous living land. Reconstruction of the school beings soon after as Wolverine and his staff are able to come to an agreement with it. Wolverine also decides to employ the services of Matt Murdock in order to sue the Hellfire Club for 879 million dollars worth of damages that they inflicted on the school during the attack. As things begin to go back to normal the school receives another instructor; Deathlok. Deathlok foresees that Apocalypse (the child version who is currently attending Wolverines school for gifted youngsters) is going to be the cause of his own death as well as the death of many others. He tells Wolverine that his capacity for good is immeasurable and that he will either be their greatest savior or he will be their undoing.</p><h3><a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/39-56674/\"> Avengers vs X-Men</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2335746\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117443/2335746-xmenleg267.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Legacy #267\"><img id=\"2335746\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117443/2335746-xmenleg267_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Legacy #267\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Legacy #267</div></div></div></div><p>With the Phoenix Force on its way to Earth, Cap asks Wolverine for assistance.

This blade has the ability to reduce his healing factor many times and when he received a very minor cut from the blade it took days for it to heal when in normal circumstances it would have healed within a matter of moments.</p><p><b>Sensory Overload-</b> Wolverine's senses can be overloaded as seen in one instance when Hulk used his thunderclap to overload Wolverine's hearing sense. This Hulk instance is however inconsistent as Wolverine has been hit with a thunderclap from quite a few times without any ill effects.</p><p><b>Decapitation-</b> Decapitating Wolverine would be a direct way in killing him but due to the fact that the adamantium that is laced around his body would prevent him healing, however this end is a high improbability. It is unknown however what would occur if Wolverine were to be decapitated and his head would be reattached to his body. <i>(In the Ultimate Universe in <a href=\"/ultimate-wolverine-vs-hulk/49-18408/\"> </a></i><i>Ultimate Wolverine vs. Hulk</i>, Wolverine had his body split in pieces by Nick Fury, leaving only his head and he was later reassembled. It is unknown if this holds true on Earth-616)</p><p><b>Adamantium Poisoning-</b> Wolverine is vulnerable to certain amounts of adamantium poisoning which has the ability to stun his healing factor to a very minor degree. If Wolverines healing factor were to be completely shutdown it is possible that over a large amount of time that the adamantium poisoning would kill him. If the adamantium that is laced throughout Wolverine's body were to every be removed it is believed that his healing factor would be increased exponentially though it is unclear how powerful it could become seeing its current possibilities.</p><p><b>Adamantium Allotropes</b>- The element of adamantium has been seen to have thirteen different allotropes because of the different molecular configurations. Wolverine has been seen to experience a type of dizziness when he comes into contact with the different elements of adamantium.</p><p><b>Carbonadium-</b> Carbonadium is a poisonous substance to Wolverine and could be potentially lethal.</p><h3><b>Equipment</b></h3><p><b>Adamantium Laced Skeleton-</b> Wolverine's entire skeleton is laced in adamantium. This makes his bones virtually indestructible. Wolverine's adamantium is a unique type to him.

Weapon X is recruited by Magneto\u2019s X-Men, though he\u2019s reticent to at first. Jean Grey convinces him, however, as their legendary romance begins. When Mr. Sinister abducts Jean, Weapon X is furious to learn that Magneto and the X-men find it too dangerous to rescue her. Angered, Logan leaves the X-men and goes after Sinister and Jean all by himself. He is however stopped by Cyclops, one of Sinister's most loyal soldiers. Cyclops and Weapon X start a brutal fight, in witch one of Logan\u2019s hands is obliterated by Cyclops' force-beam. Logan however manages to gouges out one of Cyclops\u2019 eyes. After the fight, Wolverine managed to rescue Jean from Sinister and the two made their escape. They however did not return to the X-men, still angry about not coming to Jean's rescue. Weapon X and Jean become somewhat of a fighting due, still fighting against the hordes of Apocalypse, but more stealth and only on some occasions working together with the X-men.</p><p>Weapon X and Jean came into contact with the Human Council, located in a war torn London. There they where thinking about the possibilities of nuking New York City, the strong hold of Apocalypse. A mayor fleet of airships eventually set out to New York. The Human Council however knew that this would not go unnoticed and they asked Weapon X and Jean to accompany the fleet. Weapon X and Jean however got separated during an evacuation. They promised each other to meet again, back in New York. Logan went his way and accompanied the fleet. This was not for no reason, as the ships where soon attacked by some of Apocalypse's soldiers. One of them was Carol Danvers, a former close friend to Weapon X, but she was changed into something less then human. Weapon X killed her, the fleet went on and he managed to return to New York City, right at the moment when the final battle against Apocalypse went on. During this time, Jean and former archenemy Cyclops, whom had changed sides and was now pro-human, had found each other and had become uneasy allies.</p><p>They tried to help humans escape the city, until Havok, Cyclops brother, seemingly first killed Jean, and then Cyclops. Weapon X was just about to meet Jean on the rendezvous point when he saw this scene happening. Weapon X lashed out at Havok, killing him instantly. He then ran up towards Jean, telling each other how much they loved one another. At that point, the reality known as the Age of Apocalypse seemingly dissolved, right at the moment that the nukes where about to be dropped. A great big white flash was seen and the reality seemed to vanish. This, however turned out not be the end. The reality remained and Jean had somehow managed to stop the bombs from going off. She even revived and turned into a strange Phoenix like entity. Weapon X recently is seen when the 616 Uncanny X-force team travels to the Age of Apocalypse reality. He had taken the place of Apocalypse, wearing similar armor and replacing his missing hand with an energy canon.</p><h4><b>Earth-1610 - Ultimate Universe</b></h4><p>In this reality, much similar to Earth-616, Wolverine suffered from amnesia, so little was known about his life other than he had a wife and child that were supposedly murdered by Sabretooth. As both Wolverine's and Sabretooth's memories had been tampered with by Weapon X, it is unknown whether this was true a true memory or not. However, Wolverine did posses a wedding ring that was the only link to his past. Wolverine knew Captain America, who recognized him as James Howlett who was a paratrooper in the World War 2. He was known as 'Lucky Jim' during this time as no matter how far he jumped, he always survived.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"107521\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/107521-119514-wolverine.jpg\" title=\"Earth-1610\"><img id=\"107521\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1494/107521-119514-wolverine_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-1610\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-1610</div></div></div></div><p>Wolverine was brought into the Weapon X programme by John Wraith, who kidnapped him, erased his memory and gave his the fake name 'Logan'. It was around this time that his Adamantium skeleton was fitted. Wolverine managed to escape Weapon X a couple of years later, with the help of Nick Fury and joined Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutant Supremacy and became his elite assassin. Eighteen months later, Wolverine was assigned to infiltrate the X-Mansion and assassinate Professor Xavier. He was accepted into their ranks and seduced Jean Grey in order to get himself deeper into the X-Men's ranks. However, he ended up falling in love with Jean, but she left him when she found out about his connections with the Brotherhood. Wolverine eventually betrayed Magneto and abandoned his mission to truly join the X-Men as he grew to believe in Xavier's vision.</p><p>The team travelled to the site of the Weapon X Project to find answers on Wolverine's past. While there, they encountered Wraith and Sabretooth, who burned Wolverine files containing the only link to his past to the ground. Wolverine attacked Sabretooth and threw him off a cliff and dismantled the Weapon X Project. However, by this time Jean had started a new relationship with Cyclops, which caused a rift between the two. Their rivalry grew when Xavier sent the two of them on a mission to the Savage Lands, hoping for them to resolve their rivalry. Wolverine allowed Cyclops to fall down a cliff, hoping to then start a relationship with Jean. However, Cyclops survived and revealed Wolverine's hand in his disappearance and shocked everyone when he let him remain on the team. This experience changed Wolverine's ruthlessness and he realized how he betrayed his friends. He gained a sense of responsibly and eventually formed a friendship with Cyclops.Later, Sabretooth joined Magneto as his assassin in replace of Wolverine and attacked him.</p><p>However, Wolverine managed to defeat him once and for all by cutting off his head. Wolverine then began a half-hearted relationship with Storm, which finished quickly, However, the pair still had feelings for each other and while on a date, the couple were attacked by a revived Sabretooth Storm tried to separate the two, but ended up being kept hostage. Sabretooth explained that he did not come here to fight and that his memories had returned. While on a mission to the Savage Land to find Jamie Madrox and stop his duplicates sending bombers world-wide, and vowed to do the same to Magneto. Wolverine charged at his enemy, but Magneto destroyed all of his cells by ripping the adamantium from his body, killing him.</p><h4><b>Earth-2107 - Cable (Ultimate) future</b></h4><p>The Ultimate version of <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Cable</a> is a future version of that universe\u2019s Wolverine.

His father, <a href=\"/jakob-eisenhardt/29-58084/\">Jakob Eisenhardt</a>, was a <a href=\"/world-war-i/12-56026/\">World War I</a> veteran and a proud German. The family struggled against discrimination and hardship during the <a href=\"/third-reich/65-49867/\">Nazi</a>'s rise to power, the Nuremberg laws, and Kristallnacht. In the early 1930's, the family fled to Poland, where they were captured during the Nazi invasion and sent to the Warsaw Ghetto. They managed to escape the ghetto, but were captured again. Max's <a href=\"/edie-eisenhardt/29-70787/\">mother</a>, father, and <a href=\"/ruth-eisenhardt/29-58086/\">sister</a> were executed, but Max survived (potentially thanks to an early manifestation of his powers) and was sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. There, Max became a Sonderkommando, forced to dispose of gas chamber victims. While at the camp, Max was reunited with a girl he had fallen in love with during his school days named <a href=\"../../magda/29-45372/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magda</a>. Max and and Magda escaped when Auschwitz was liberated and were soon married.</p><p>They moved to the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsia, where they started their new lives together. Max adopted the name \"Magnus\" and Magda gave birth to their daughter who they named <a href=\"/anya/29-45373/\">Anya</a>. Magnus worked as a carpenter to support the family and for a time they lived happily. One night Magnus was attacked and instinctively lashed out with his <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">mutant</a> powers of magnetism (which had never surfaced before due to a bout of scarlet fever as a child), killing the attackers. Later that evening, he returned home to find his house on fire, with Anya trapped inside. Magnus rushed inside to rescue her but he was too late.</p><p>Enraged at the death of his beloved daughter, he used his new powers to kill the surrounding mob that started the fire. Magda, terrified of her husband's strange abilities, fled to the forest and never saw her husband again. Magda made her way to <a href=\"/wundagore-mountain-transia/34-41286/\">Wundagore Mountain</a>, where she gave birth to twins Pietro and Wanda (who would grew up to be <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a> and <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch</a>, respectively). Magda later disappeared, presumed deceased. During the next few years Magnus had an identity forger named Greg Odekirk create him a new identity, reinventing himself as a gypsy named \"Erik Magnus Lehnsherr\".</p><p>It was while using this identity that he went to <a href=\"/israel/34-55950/\">Israel</a> to help at a psychiatric hospital. There, he met <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Charles Xavier</a>. The two became fast friends, playing chess and having intellectual debates about mutation and the future of mankind. When <a href=\"../../baron-von-strucker/29-4662/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker</a> attacked a young patient named <a href=\"/gabrielle-haller/29-15049/\">Gabrielle Haller</a>, Xavier and Magnus used their powers in order to save her. Following the battle, Charles and Magnus realized they had very differing ideologies. Magnus disappeared and the two friends would not meet again for many years. During the next few years, Magnus worked for the <a href=\"/cia/65-55745/\">CIA</a> hunting Nazis, but this association ended when they murdered a girl he was becoming close to. Magnus would not be seen again until he became the mutant known as Magneto.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Magneto was created by writer <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1963. He made his first appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-x-men/37-6694/\">X-Men #1</a>, becoming the very first foe of the iconic mutant team. Creator Stan Lee stated that he \"did not think of Magneto as a bad guy. He was just trying to strike back at the people who were so bigoted and racist. He was trying to defend mutants, and because society was not treating them fairly, he decided to teach society a lesson. He was a danger of course, but I never thought of him as a villain.\" Lee also explained that he originally planned for Magneto to be Professor Xavier's brother rather than simply an old friend.</p><h2><b>Character Evolution</b></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"75994\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75994-20209-magneto.jpg\" title=\"The Master of Magnetism\"><img id=\"75994\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75994-20209-magneto_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Master of Magnetism\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Master of Magnetism</div></div></div></div><p>In his initial appearances, Magneto was portrayed as a would-be tyrant who would often abuse his subjects (he physical abused his lackey <a href=\"/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a>, while Scarlet Witch was psychologically tormented into obedience). Eventually, (as Marvel did with many of their long-lasting villains over the years) Magneto was given a more humanized portrayal as a Holocaust survivor who wanted to ensure that mutants would not suffer the same fate his family did for being born different.</p><p>Magneto has long been the face of mutant separatism, in opposition to Charles Xavier's ideal of coexistence with humanity. Believing that mutants are the next stage in human evolution, he sought to assert their dominance over the planet. This was Magneto's means of assuring the survival of his people in a world that hates and fears them for there very existence. Though not a hero, Magneto is charismatic, noble, and wise. His long and turbulent friendship with Charles Xavier has been a cornerstone for both men's lives, as a rivalry that has lasted decades.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3><b>War on Humanity</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2404436\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108904/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super.jpg\" title=\"The Brotherhood\"><img id=\"2404436\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108904/2404436-284968_38922_brotherhood_of_evil_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Brotherhood\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Brotherhood</div></div></div></div><p>After years of lying low, Magnus eventually resurfaced, now using the identity of \"Magneto\" bursting into the public eye. He attacked <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cape-citadel/34-41284/\">Cape Citadel</a>, but was stopped by the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, a confrontation that would spark a decades long rivalry. Some months later, Magneto was seen leading a team of mutants witch he mockinly named the <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brotherhood of \"Evil\" Mutants</a>. This group consisted of a few mutants including, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. These young mutants where actually his daughter and son, but none of them knew at the time. Demanding not merely equal rights, the Brotherhood sought supremacy for mutant-kind. Their vicious attacks against humans led them to attract the attention of Professor Xavier and his X-Men, whom where often able to repel the group. Magneto did however not just fight against the X-men but many other superhero groups such as the Avengers and the Fantastic Four. During one of Magneto's plans, Professor Xavier sought the help of the superheroes team known as the Defenders. Magneto had made a new mutant-like entity named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-the-ultimate-mutant/29-25737/\">Alpha the Ultimate Mutant</a>. This mutant was made by Magneto to help further his cause. The creature however turned on him and returned Magneto to the age of an infant. The child was brought into the care of Charles Xavier, whom brought it over to his former lover Moria McTaggert. She took care of the infant Magneto for some months before he was restored to his prime age as a young man. Although chaken by the events and perhaps changed for good, Magneto still sought out to win his war against humanity.</p><h3><b>Reformation Period</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"307955\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/307955-75109-magneto_super.jpg\" title=\"Headmaster Magneto\"><img id=\"307955\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/307955-75109-magneto_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Headmaster Magneto\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Headmaster Magneto</div></div></div></div><p>During a particularly heated battle with the X-Men, Magneto wounds and nearly kills <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitty Pryde</a> (then only fourteen). Stricken with the revelation that he\u2019s become a horrific extremist, willing to murder even children to achieve his goals, Magneto renounces his terrorist ways. He seeks out his former wife <a href=\"/magda/29-45372/\">Magda</a> and learns of her death, but also the truth about <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> and <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a>: that they are his children. While the pair accept that he\u2019s their father, they reject Magneto's leadership for his abusive treatment of them over their years in the Brotherhood. Time would eventually heal their wounds, and they would come to a grudging acceptance of him. Magneto joins the X-Men after being persuaded to give human/mutant co-existence a chance by Professor Xavier. This comes at a time when Charles is badly injured in battle and Magneto takes over the reing of his school, teaching young mutants to control their powers and use them for the betterment of both humans and mutants. He started teaching the New Mutants and fought alongside the X-men. This, at first was very difficult for many of the teammembers, since they had done battle against Magneto more then once. However, Magneto proved to be a valiable ally and the X-men started to trust him. Even <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, previously extremely wary of the mutant leader, grew to accept him. <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> even started to have romantic feelings towards Magneto, despite their age difference. It appeared Magneto was truly a changed man. He even went before a court of law to stand trial for his past misdeeds. Although they came into confilct with the Avengers at the time, Magneto was eventually cleared of his past misdeeds. A largely suprised Magneto now feld like a free man once more whom had made a change for the good.</p><p>However, certain events would reverse a great many of those feelings soon.

Some months later, during the events of the Fall of the Mutants, Magneto's star pupils, <a href=\"/cypher/29-14559/\">Cypher</a>, was killed by a human. This incident and the fact that he could not have protected an inoccent young mutant under his care, started breaking Magneto up. At this time, he also lost contact with the X-men when the team went to Australia. In finding security for his New Mutant students, Magneto went as far as joining longtime X-Men rivals the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> in hope of providing the security for them that he could not give. The New Mutants however wanted nothing to do with Magneto anymore, feeling he had betrayed them. Magneto angerly left the New Mutants and, after this, many of his human-hating ways resurfaced. Ultimately, Magneto would view his role as leader of the X-men and teacher of the New Mutants as a failure on his part and he retired to <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Asteroid M</a> to live in seclusion.</p><h3><b>Mutant Separatism</b></h3><p>While living in isolation, a group of mutants led by <a href=\"../../fabian-cortez/29-9728/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabian Cortez</a> calling themselves the <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a> approached Magneto asking for his leadership. Magneto decided that his best course of action would be to create a nation for mutants unto themselves and goes so far as declaring <a href=\"../../asteroid-m/34-41752/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asteroid M</a> such a nation. Magneto even made the move to defend himself against further attacks of the human race by taking up the armed missiles of a Russian submarine he sunk years ago. The X-Men responded akkordingly by assaulting Magneto and his group of mutants. While the X-man Rogue tried to bring peace between the former allies, it ultimately had no effect. Magneto turned his back on the X-men for good, feeling they had not only betrayed him in not trusting his judgement, but also betraying their friendship. The X-men then assauled the asteroid, with Cortez\u2019 betrayal leading to Magneto\u2019s ultimate defeat. Magneto retreated to his back-up space station <a href=\"/avalon/34-41283/\">Avalon</a> where he grew even more bitter then before. Erik however soon encountered the X-men once again, during the X-Men\u2019s siege on Avalon. With this conflict, Magneto still held back against his former allies, until the X-man Wolverine attacked him and almost gutted him. He then used his powers to rip the adamantium from Wolverine's skeleton, almost killing him. An angered and furious Xavier lashed out, wiping Magneto's mind and leaving him in a catatonic state. The X-man Colossus turned sides on the X-men and helped Magneto out of Avalon and returned him to a rebuild Astroid M.</p><h3>Joseph</h3><p>For months, the catatonic Magneto sat on his thrown on Astroid M, being served by his Acolytes, but not being able to even utter a word. This all changed when the Age of Apocalypse refugee named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/holocaust/29-15071/\">Holocaust</a> entered the base and brought it down around them. Magneto was however saved and found himself alone again back on earth. It was then that the mutant teleporter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/astra/29-46525/\">Astra</a>, as a way of revenge, restored Magneto's memories (by an unknown method), and created a clone named Joseph from his DNA. It was her plan to kill Magneto off after that, but the clone went out of control and during this scene, Magneto managed to escape. For some months, it was thought that Jospeh was acutally Magneto. The clone even became an ally to the X-men.</p><p>It took a few more months before Magneto finally made himself known to the world once again. Disguised, Magneto placed the fate of humanity in the hands of an average man name William Jones. William was investigating the freakish building collapse of the Center for Humanitarian Excellence in Los Angeles, which was suspected to be the work of mutants. Magneto, posing as a board member, engaged William in conversation. The two had a pleasent conversation until Magneto showed him his powers and told him who he really was. William became affraid and told him in all honesty that he would like him to be gone from this world, not because he hated him, but because of his overwhelming power and what he did with it. Having perverted his supposedly objective experiment in human nature to his own ends, Magneto thanked William and left him to meet his cadre of robots at the magnetic north pole, where he began to manipulate the Polar magnetic fields. Only if the United Nations would mett his demands, he would stop destroying the Polar magnetic fields. Luckily, the X-men interveaned and managed to defeat Magneto, with Magneto's clone Joseph dying in the proces. His defeat was however not before the United Nations mett his demands, giving Magneto his only island to rule, the nation of Genosha.</p><h3>Leader of Genosha</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1895827\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38741/1895827-ucx_0010.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1895827\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38741/1895827-ucx_0010_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Magneto was given full authority by the United Nation to become the leader of the Island nation of Genosha. A difficult task lay before him since the country was wrecked during the civil war between humans and mutants after the uprising of the former mutant slaves. Magneto however soon managed to establish a government and tried to bring order to the nation. Despite some difficulties, Magneto managed to pull it of. He even got help from his son and daughter, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, as well as Polaris, during this time. Genosha became a utopian nation for mutants where they could live in peace and freedom. Some months later however, Magneto kidnapped Charles Xavier in order to show him what he had achieved. A newly formed team of X-men managed to free Xavier, while Wolverine gutted Magneto badly and was left with serious injurys. Magneto however had full right to defend his nation from foreign diplomacy (being the X-men) and while Magneto was defeated in battle, he won the war when the X-men left the nation.</p><h3>Destruction of a Nation</h3><p>Some weeks went by and Erik was healing from his last battle against the X-men. It was at this time that a full frontal Sentinel attack was undertaken on Genosha by the mencae known as Cassandra Nova. Magneto was seemingly one of the first to fall in battle. A giant airplane with the appearance of an iron fist entered the tower in witch Magneto was located. After this first attack, a huge Sentinel destroyed the entire city, leaving almost everyone dead. When the X-men came to investigate they saw the slaughter of countless mutants. A true new dark age for the mutants had begun. While investigating, the X-men found a tape that was made by Magneto a few minutes prior to his seeming death. He told his nation to never give up and be strong, even in the darkest of times. It seemed that Erik Lenhsherr, Magneto, had finally perished in battle.</p><h3><b>Xorn</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"78429\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/78429-161566-xorn.jpg\" title=\"Xorn\"><img id=\"78429\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/78429-161566-xorn_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Xorn\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Xorn</div></div></div></div><p>After believing Magneto gone for good, the newest teacher at the Xavier Institute, the enigmatic, masked mutant known as <a href=\"/xorn/29-3183/\">Xorn</a>, revealed himself as Magneto in disguise to Professor Xavier. This \"Magneto\" told Charles he had been living under their nouses the whole time and now, along with several mutants he had been teaching there, staged an attack on the island of <a href=\"/manhattan/34-57225/\">Manhattan</a>. This included murdering numerous humans in crematoriums, mirroring his Holocaust persecution. The X-Men however doubted his legitimacy as the real \"Master of Magnetism\". However, his addiction to the power-enhacing drug named \u201c <a href=\"/kick/12-42307/\">Kick</a>\u201d allowed him to assault and kill <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> by giving her a planetary-scale stroke. An enraged Wolverine decapitated the alleged Magneto, who was later revealed to be an imposter under the influence of X-men enemy <a href=\"/sublime/29-11330/\">Sublime</a>. The real Magneto had never left the island of Genosha after the attacks on it by Cassandra Nova. Eventually, Charles Xavier contacted Magneto and went to Genosha to figur out what Erik's next move should be. He was now the world's most hated man, even though it had not been him that attacked humankind this time. Magneto was furious to think that people would actually think him able to do those horrible acts. Magneto and Xavier remained on the island for a longer period of time, in the meantime finding other survivors of the Sentinels attacks. The two became close friends once more over the period of time and Magneto finally seemed to have forsaken his more violant ways. Things all changed when Charles and Erik saw a news-broughtcast that showed images of Erik's daughter, Wanda Maximoff, to have suffered a nervous breakdown and hurt and killed many of her former Avengers teammates in the proces. She had been taken into custody. Magneto donned his uniform once more and went straight to New York City, leaving Charles and his more peacefull life behind.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a></b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"93988\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/93988-159329-magneto_super.jpg\" title=\"House of Magnus\"><img id=\"93988\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/93988-159329-magneto_medium.jpg\" alt=\"House of Magnus\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">House of Magnus</div></div></div></div><p>After <a href=\"/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Wanda</a> devastatingly, but accidentally, disbanded the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and was rendered unconscious, Magneto appeared and demanded to have his daughter remanded to his care. The Avengers and the X-men at this point found out that Magneto was still alive and that he was not the one responsible for the attacks on New York City, witch where actually Xorn's. The Avengers accepted a grieving father's demands and gave Wanda, somewhat relunctant, over to Magneto. Magneto then returened back with Wanda to the island of Genosha where he and Charles Xavier had spent their last months. Magneto watched over his sleeping daughter, kept unconscious by Xavier. However, both the X-men and the newly formed Avengers saw Wanda as a threat and where planing to bring Wanda in, or even have her killed should that be neccesary. Magneto's son, <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Pietro</a> (Quicksilver) demanded that Magneto saved her. Magneto retorted that it was out of his hands and there was nothing he could do. On the one hand Wanda was indeed his flesh and blood and he would give his life for her, but on the other hand, she clearly had a mental breakdown and was dangerous. It was then that the combined forces of the X-Men and the <a href=\"/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a> arrived on Magneto's doorstep. Before they could act however, the world flashed white and when it returned it had been remade as a world where mutants where the dominant species and humanity was on the decline. Magneto was now ruler over the sovereign nation of Genosha, the dominant superpower in the world, and mutants held almost all worldwide positions of power.</p><p>The world has been reversed: mutants now subjugate and legislate against humans, waiting for them to die out over the natural course of their existence. When Wolverine and a mysterious girl named <a href=\"/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a> begin restoring the memories of the heroes, they staged a daring coup against Magneto\u2019s headquarters where Wanda was kept. The revelation came out that it was actually Pietro, not Erik, who convinced Wanda to remake the world in this image. As the world crumbled around them, Wanda utters three simple words: No more mutants. When everything returns to normal, 99% of the world\u2019s mutant population has been depowered, including Magneto. This day would be known as M-Day</p><h3>X-men Legacy</h3><p>For the months after, Magneto wondered the earth, even contacting his old friend Xavier again, whom both got in trouble when Magneto's old soldiers, the Accolytes, wanted to kill Xavier and no longer lissened to Magneto, because he no longer was a mutant. Magneto and Xavier teamed up and managed to break free of the Accolytes and stopped them from further persuid. The two then again went their seperate ways. Some months later again, Magneto contacted the High Evolutionary whom managed to return Magneto's lost mutant powers once again. This all hapenned during a ruse where he attacked the X-men once again. He was now the only mutant to regain his powers after losing them on M-Day.</p><h3><a href=\"/nation-x/39-55961/\">Nation X</a></h3><p>Magneto, with his powers back, stood for a choice, returning to his old ways or now join the X-men on their homebase known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Utopia</a>. Since no more then 200 mutants remained after M-Day, Magneto thought the few that where still there should stand strong together. He embarked on a journey to Utopia where he was met with anger by the X-men. When he arrives, Xavier demands he leave, but Cyclops overrules him and allows Magneto to state his business. Magneto then fell down on his knies and praised Cyclops' leadership and asked him if he could join them. Xavier refused to accept Magneto\u2019s suspicous acts and change of heart and telepathically attacks him, but Cyclops stops the attack and orders Xavier to leave. Magneto laments the future of their race, but Cyclops assures him that <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope Summers</a>, the Mutant Messiah is alive and well. Magneto swears fealty to the X-Men and is made a senior member of Cyclops\u2019 cabinet.</p><p>He\u2019s still not fully accepted, however, as Cyclops reprimands him for taking what he believed to be too much initiative by constructing a giant support column to not only support Utopia, but house the Atlantean refugees, calling the structure New Atlantis. To finally atone for his past sins, he journeys to the top of a mountain to reflect and finally realizes what he can do: bring Kitty Pryde back to Earth. He saw the massive bullet she was trapped in when he was in the High Evolutionary\u2019s space station and uses his abilities to bring her back, but he lapses into a coma.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/second-coming/39-55971/\">Second Coming</a></b></h3><p>Magneto comes out of his coma right after Hope was teleported into Utopia by a dying <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>. With the <a href=\"/nimrod/29-13314/\">Nimrod</a> Sentinels laying siege to Utopia, Magneto stopped <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Hank McCoy</a> from leaving his patients as he stated that he had made certain promises to himself, which precluded him from laying in bed while his people were in danger of genocide. Magneto prepares for battle and manage to hold off a squad of Nimrods by attacking them with electrical blasts before finally dismembering the robots by pulling shards of iron from the core of Utopia through them. The wounded but victorious Magneto then gave a speech to the awed young mutants that surrounded him that it was their destiny to inherit the world. On one day, Magneto receives a lead from X-men teammate <a href=\"/doctor-nemesis/29-29259/\">Dr. Nemesis</a> on one of his old Nazi tormentors. Erik reveals to Wolverine's <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> that he is aware of their existence, and trades his silence for the murder of the Nazi officer. <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> takes the task on alone and completes it.</p><h3><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/schism/39-56404/\">Schism</a></b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1820611\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1820611-xmenschism3a.jpg\" title=\"Facing the Hellfire Club\"><img id=\"1820611\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1820611-xmenschism3a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Facing the Hellfire Club\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Facing the Hellfire Club</div></div></div></div><p>Magneto appears alongside <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>, and <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> at the unveiling of a mutant museum in <a href=\"/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a> under orders from <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>. The highly publicized event is attacked by the new <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>. Each of the X-Men present are taken down one by one through technology specifically designed to defeat each of them. Magneto is shot with a miniaturized neutron star. The Hellfire Club then attaches brain slugs to the X-Men to keep them unconscious. <a href=\"/oya/29-73388/\">Idie</a>, the only mutant left in the museum unscathed, kills the remaining Hellfire members to save everyone.</p><p>The Hellfire Club unleashes a giant <a href=\"/sentinel/29-5281/\">Sentinel</a>, charged with destroying <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Utopia</a>. Cyclops and some of the younger mutants prepare to stand their ground, while <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> demands that the children run and save themselves. The Sentinel winds up being defeated. However, the X-Men are split between Cyclops and Wolverine. Magneto remains loyal to Cyclops and stays on Utopia.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/regenesis/39-56644/\">Regenesis</a></b></h3><p>Magneto is later assigned to Cyclops' new \"Extinction Team\", which also consists of Namor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger/29-40862/\">Danger</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magik/29-8303/\">Magik</a>, Colossus, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope</a>, and Emma Frost. In a training exercise between the Extinction Team and Hope's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/five-lights/65-57893/\">Lights</a>, Magneto is attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zero/29-73182/\">Zero</a> and reacts by brutally by ripping him in half with his magnetic powers. Zero is able to pull himself back together (which Magneto knew he was capable of doing), but Magneto is harshly reprimanded by Hope and Cyclops for attacking so harshly during a training exercise. After the apparent death of <a href=\"/jocasta/29-3318/\">Jocasta</a>, <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> calls for <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> and Magneto to aid him in his investigation. Upon their arrival to the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast-compound/34-57042/\">West Coast Academy</a>, Magneto agrees to assist so long as <a href=\"/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> refrains from involving himself in any mutant affairs. He claims that Pietro coerced his sister into the events that led to her breakdown and cites his misuse of the <a href=\"/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">Terrigen Mists</a> and the war that was caused due to it.</p><p>Magneto is also faced with a ghost from his past in the form of his clone, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joseph/29-15063/\">Joseph</a>. Disguised as Magneto, Joseph kills a group of anti-mutant protesters witch causes a conflict between Magneto and the authorities and the Avengers. The Avengers claim Magneto to be the purpitraitor. However, Magneto soon found out that the mutant teleporter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/astra/29-46525/\">Astra</a>, an old nemesis to Magneto as well as the person whom created the original Joseph, was to blame for the new Joseph and the murders. Eventually Magneto managed to clear his name and defeated Astra while Joseph was brought over to Cyclops where he was imprisonned.</p><h3><a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/39-56674/\">Avengers vs. X-Men</a></h3><p>When Captain America arrives on <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Utopia</a> to discuss <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope</a> and the returning <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>, Magneto stands in the background along with the Extinction Team. Once <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> blasts Captain America, Magneto lifts <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> into a magnetic fastball special and launches him into the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Magneto then saves <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> from Iron Man but Quicksilver jumps in to stop him. Magneto takes on Iron Man who is wearing a carbon nano fiber suit. Unable to control his suit, Magneto drops a tower of Utopia on Iron Man, crushing him. Tony comes through the rubble and fires 2 million neodymium high grade magnets to counter Erik's powers. Magneto blasts through them but Tony activates satellites around Jupiter and siphons the planets magnetic field unleashing it in a uni-beam and firing back at Erik. Erik destroys the satellites and creates his own suit of armor and begins to punch it out with Iron Man. During the fight he begins to realize that the Phoenix is most likely going to destroy them and winds up getting distracted and punched out by Iron Man.

He can perceive the magnetic forces of the Earth as well as the bio-electrical patterns of all living beings. He can draw on and use the magnetosphere of the planet, which extends far into space. Magneto can use his vast power to reshape even the most indestructible metals, including the <a href=\"../../adamantium/18-40759/\" rel=\"nofollow\">adamantium</a> in <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>'s skeleton. He been shown controlling the most insignificant magnetic particles in the both atmosphere and in living beings, reversing their blood flow or ripping out any ferrous elements through their tissues. Magneto can also create fields of magnetism strong enough to manipulate non-ferrous items, though he may be using anti-gravity fields to do this. He has demonstrated the ability to lift thousands of tons with his magnetic powers, although the greater he exerts himself the greater the physical and mental stress. Magneto also has the ability to increase his physical attributes by directing his magnetic powers inward. He has been seeing increasing his physical strength, durability as well as speed and reaction time.</p><p>Magneto can create powerful magnetic force fields for personal protection, project blasts of electricity or magnetic energy, and generate powerful electromagnetic pulses. He can also assemble complicated machines within seconds through the use of his powers. Although Magneto's primary power is the control over magnetism, he can also manipulate any form of energy from the electromagnetic spectrum. This includes visible light, radio waves, ultraviolet light, gamma rays, and x-rays. It is more difficult for Magneto to manipulate other forms of energy, so he predominately only uses magnetism.</p><h3><u>Abilities</u></h3><h4>Genius-level Intellect</h4><p>Magneto is a genius with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially genetic mutation, particle physics, engineering, and robotics. His intellect has allowed him to create many advanced and complex machines, most of which are well beyond the scope contemporary science. He has engineered advanced robots, space stations, devices capable of nullifying mutant powers except for his own, devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, and devices that block telepathy. He can create artificial living beings (such as <a href=\"/alpha-the-ultimate-mutant/29-25737/\">Alpha the Ultimate Mutant</a>) and fully-grown adult clones, as well as mutate humans in order to give them superhuman powers.</p><h4>Master Combatant</h4><p>Magneto has some military training in hand-to-combat, and is capable of holding his own in a fight, but prefers the use of his powers in most combat situations.

In truth, he was taken away from this reality by the Timebreakers and was placed in the new Exiles team. Magneto was sure that his son had just left home to start his own life until his burned corpse was sent back.

What the church did not know was the Enrique, assisted by his children Petros and Wanda (though they were not aware he was their father), was smuggling mutants who could pass for human out of Europe while burning only those that could not, such as Angel, at the stake. When his secret activities were discovered by the church, he, along with Wanda and Petros, were forced to flee to the New World to the colony of mutants he had secreted out of Europe. After he assisted in helping return Steve Rogers to the proper time stream, he left Wanda and Petros in Carlos Javier's care with the instruction that Carlos was not to tell them he was their father.

Here he was born Erik Lensherr. Erik killed his mother (his father's fate is unknown) when he found out that his mother was a project manager of the Weapon X program and had kept and tortured Wolverine, Erik freed Logan and then fought his way out. Magneto's mother had wanted to \"cure\" mutants, and her son. However, it has also been alluded to that he is from a very wealthy and well-connected family that he has parted ways with. His wife's name was Isabelle, and he is aware from the beginning of his familial relationship with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. It is also noted that he verbally mistreats them, hinting that he regards them as a living reminder of having an inter-species relationship. This version of Magneto is significantly darker and more cynical than the mainstream version, regarding all humans with utter and unwavering disdain and likening them to \"insects\".</p><p>An arrogant fantasist who gradually sank deeper and deeper into his self-proclaimed role as Mutant Messiah, Eric Lensherr eventually reinvented himself as Magneto, the leader of the Brotherhood Of Mutants and a ruthless terrorist who is willing to kill hundreds in the name of mutant supremacy. On several occasions Magneto has attempted to implement unflinchingly genocidal plans on humanity. He commands a noticeably larger Brotherhood than his mainstream counterpart and has displayed enough power to defeat the Ultimates.</p><p>Additionally, he was the one to cripple Professor X. Before the end of their association, Xavier and Magneto shared a very intense intellectual friendship. Using his knowledge of technology and genetics, Magneto helped Xavier to create the Savage Land as a mutant utopia. He also created an artificial language called Epsilon-Omega, based on Esperanto and featuring its own script, for mutants to use in the Savage Land, as a rejection of human languages. They even have plays, poetry, and songs in this language.</p><p><b>Major Story Arc:</b></p><p>Ultimate Magneto originally recruits Wolverine to infiltrate the X-Men and kill Professor X. While with the X-Men, Wolverine joins them for an attack on the Brotherhood. Magneto appeals to them with his own ideals of mutant superiority. He dismisses the X-Men however Cyclops returns later after a fight with Professor X. Magneto asks Cyclops to address him as father when in front of Quicksilver. When the Sentinels attack all mutants in major cities, Magneto takes control of them and rewires them to hunt humans. Cyclops reveals to have been spying on the Brotherhood and calls the X-Men for help. Magneto is about to crush the President between two cars but is stopped in time by Professor X. Wolverine stabs him in the chest from behind and Quicksilver takes off his helmet. Professor X is able to take control of Erik's mind and turns him into a super magnet, crushing him in front of everyone.</p><h3><b>Marvel Zombieverse (Earth-2149)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"700461\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/700461-magneto_super.jpg\" title=\"Zombieverse Magneto\"><img id=\"700461\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/700461-magneto_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Zombieverse Magneto\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zombieverse Magneto</div></div></div></div><p>When turning an asteroid away from the Earth, the Sentry had come in contact with a disease that turned normal people into flesh craving zombies.

Though it was rare for any character, let alone a new one, to get a self-named title in those days, he debuted in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america-comics-meet-captain-america/37-107870/\">Captain America Comics #1</a> (March,1941). He was depicted fighting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adolf-hitler/29-9671/\">Adolph Hitler</a> himself on the cover even though the United States had not yet entered World War II and wouldn't for another 9 months. Debuting along with Captain America in this comic was his teenage partner Bucky, and his arch-enemy the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a>. This issue sold nearly one million copies and Captain America soon became <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel's</a> best-selling character.</p><p>\"Cap\" (as he came to affectionately be called) spent World War II punching, kicking and defeating Nazis, Japanese, and other Axis members. In addition to help from Bucky, he battled the Axis forces alongside other Marvel (Timely) stalwarts: the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Sub-Mariner</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jim-hammond/29-12605/\">Human Torch</a>. Simon and Kirby did ten issues before leaving Timely to work for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC</a>. When the war eventually ended, superheroes fell out of favor and comics sales declined. Captain America Comics was printed up to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america-comics-hoofprints-of-doom/37-140225/\">issue #75</a>, but by then it had become a horror book and soon ended.</p><p>Captain America was revived by one of his original co-creators Jack Kirby and Stan Lee during 1964 in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-avengers-captain-america-joins-the-avengers/37-7025/\">issue #4</a> of the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>. This was the start of Cap as we know him. He became an instant hit and was soon leading the Avengers. A short time later he shared and co-headlined a comic called <a href=\"/tales-of-suspense/49-2007/\">\"Tales of Suspense\"</a> along with fellow Avenger <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>. He has since become one of the cornerstones of the Marvel Universe and even transcended comics becoming a true American icon. Additionally, Captain America has been recreated many times over the years in comics featuring stories that take place in alternate universes. One of the most well-known alternate universe versions of Captain America is in the Ultimate Universe.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><h3><b>The War</b></h3><p>On July 4, 1920, Steven Rogers was born to a pair of Irish immigrants. Steve was always a courageous kid as well as a diligent student, but he wasn't very athletic and he was quiet and introverted. Although he would eventually grow to 6'2, he was scrawny and weak, always last in athletic games (much like one <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a>, that would be born much later). A target for bullies as he grew up, he was protected by his best friend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arnie-roth/29-32774/\">Arnie Roth</a>, and, on at least one occasion, by neighborhood tough-guy <a href=\"/dominic-fortune/29-28466/\">Duvid Fortunov</a>. Though it wasn't apparent at the time, he possessed fierce loyalty, a courageous fighting spirit and a noble heart. Knowing he had no future in athletics, Steve majored in fine arts and was an exceptionally talented artist specializing in illustration.</p><p>His life changed, though, when the Axis forces sweep across <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/europe/34-56099/\">Europe</a> starting World War II. Seeing their atrocities on newsreels, Rogers becomes convinced they need to be fought and that the European war would soon pull America into the conflict, inspiring him to enlist in the U.S. armed forces to fight against the Axis forces.</p><h3>Becoming Captain America</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1871197\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><img id=\"1871197\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1871197-captainamerica1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America punches Adolph Hitler!\" /><div class=\"item-caption\">Captain America punches Adolph Hitler!</div></div></div></div><p>Steve was immediately rejected due to his physically frailty and classified as \"4-F.\" Steve was puny and didn't even come close to passing the mandatory physical exam for induction, although he wanted with all his heart to serve his country, he was rejected. It seemed there was nothing he could do. He eventually makes an impression on the Army recruiters and trainers. He'd shown them just how desperately he wanted to do his part, and how it is his dream to fight for America. Steve catches the attention of an officer whom is looking for men to volunteer as test subjects for an experimental program which was part of a top-secret defense plan known only to less than a dozen men. The experimental program was Operation: Rebirth. The plan was to create physically superior soldiers with a new serum dubbed the Super-Soldier Formula. If it worked, it would make ordinary men into super soldiers. They would become perfect physical beings; possessing strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and recuperative powers that bordered near the upper limits of human evolutionary potential.</p><p>After a rigorous process to choose a suitable candidate, Steve Rogers was chosen to be the first man whom the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/18-55976/\">Super Soldier Serum</a> would be administered to. It was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abraham-erskine/29-43681/\">Dr. Abraham Erskine</a> who had developed the process, and it was he who administered it to Rogers. Rogers was injected with the Super Soldier Serum and was then bathed in Vita-Rays which activated and stabilized the serum's chemicals in his system.</p><p>The process worked perfectly; Steve Rogers' entire physical being was boosted to the maximum of human potential and efficiency. In addition, he virtually doubled in size as millions of new cells were created almost instantaneously. His muscle strength, flexibility and reflexes improved to the peak of human potential. Steve marveled, he had become the ultimate specimen of human physical power and ability as all weakness and deficiencies drained from his body. Just then, a Nazi spy burst in with a gun. He cried \"Hail Hitler\" and shot Erskine through the head. In order to keep Nazi spies from obtaining it, Erskine hadn't written down the serum's ingredients, along with much of the procedure, having instead committed it to memory. Therefore the secret of the Super Soldier Serum died with him. Steve Rogers would be the only Super-Soldier. He chased after and caught the Nazi spy who'd assassinated Erskine and broke his neck, killing him. He then vowed to use his power to fight the enemies of America and become a symbol of freedom.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"78555\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/54/78555-95275-captain-america_super.jpg\" title=\"Captain America - The Sentinel of Liberty\"><img id=\"78555\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/54/78555-95275-captain-america_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America - The Sentinel of Liberty\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Captain America - The Sentinel of Liberty</div></div></div></div><p>The U.S government, disappointed at the loss of their planned super soldier army was determined to use Rogers to his fullest potential. To this end, they decided to use him as a superhero to fight the Nazis; to become a symbol of freedom and hope against Nazi forces as well as a counter-intelligence agent. He also would be their answer to and main weapon against the leader of the Nazi terrorist operations - the <a href=\"/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a>. The U.S. Government gave him a costume based on the American flag, an unbreakable shield (given to him by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-d-roosevelt/29-31595/\">President Franklin Roosevelt</a>), a sidearm, and the name Captain America. From that point on, Steve Rogers was Captain America. A short time later he was stationed on an army base in Virginia serving as private Steve Rogers.</p><p>While there he continued his extensive training and was deployed several times both domestically and abroad on covert missions. When on base as private, Steve purposely develops a persona and reputation as a clumsy soon-to-be soldier. It was also during this period that he meets Bucky Barnes - a young teenager who accidentally found out that Steve Rogers was secretly Captain America. With the U.S. Federal Governments permission, Steve trains Bucky and makes him his sidekick. Captain America and Bucky became a formidable fighting duo during World War II.</p><h3>Invaders</h3><p>The two fight crime and Nazis on their own and, after Pearl Harbor, help found the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invaders/65-25865/\">Invaders</a>, an Allied superhero team that fought against the Axis and their super-powered agents. The Invaders were featured in a comic book of their own in the 1970s. Recently, it has been stated that Bucky was already being trained when Steve/Captain America met him at the military base, hence, his being able to fight side-by-side with Cap almost immediately despite not having any super-powers.</p><p>A few years passed, and, in part due to Captain America and the Invaders' contributions, by 1945 the war was drawing to an end in Europe with the Allies driving the Germans out of the countries they had occupied. With the Nazi's retreating, Cap and Bucky were on a routine mission-they are trying to stop the evil <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baron-heinrich-zemo/29-3708/\">Baron Heinrich Zemo</a> from destroying a drone plane. The patriotic duo engaged Zemo and his troops but before he was could be stopped, Zemo managed to launch the plane up into the air towards allied forces armed with a huge bomb. Racing towards the plane as it's about to launch, Captain America and Bucky managed to jump onto it so they could try to defuse the bomb. Cap realized they couldn't defuse it in time and tried to get Bucky, who was closer to the bomb, to jump off but it exploded and seemingly killed Bucky while throwing Captain America into the freezing waters of the north <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atlantic-ocean/34-56201/\">Atlantic Ocean</a>. All searches to rescue or recover him fail and he is eventually presumed dead. Steve Rogers was believed to be dead for many years, and efforts to replace him failed.</p><h3><b>Replacing A Legend</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"152173\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/152173-60077-spirit-of-76_super.jpg\" title=\"The Spirit of '76\"><img id=\"152173\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/152173-60077-spirit-of-76_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Spirit of '76\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Spirit of '76</div></div></div></div><p>With Captain America frozen in a block of ice, the government decided that Captain America is still needed. Even though the war was won, they figured if the American public found out Cap was dead, their morale would be severely diminished, something that could not be risked while <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a> continued to fight Allied forces in the Pacific. As it would turn out several replacements were needed to try to carry the mantle of \"Captain America.\"</p><p>The first replacement they hire is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spirit-of-76/29-44573/\">Spirit of '76</a>, a patriotic hero whose abilities were similar to Captain America. His \u201cBucky\u201d is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fred-davis/29-22647/\">Fred Davis</a>, a relatively normal young man. Cap and Bucky operate very well (working with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/all-winners-squad/65-44808/\">All-Winners Squad</a>), but Adam II (an android) killed Cap in 1946. He was replaced by The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patriot/29-44588/\">Patriot</a>, another Golden Age hero, but two years later, \"Bucky\" was shot in the legs. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/golden-girl/29-34752/\">Golden Girl</a> then became Cap's partner, until they both quit to marry each other. Seeing that replacing Cap was hard, the government let the idea fade and there was no Captain America and no Bucky.</p><h3><b>1950s Commie-Bustin' Cap</b></h3><p>In the 1950s, there was a brief run of the Captain America comic where, in keeping with the spirit of the times and the newly started 'Cold War' with communist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/russia/34-55706/\">Russia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/peoples-republic-of-china/34-55795/\">China</a>, Captain America becomes a more aggressive, conservative, communist-fighting character. When the real Captain America made his return in the '60s, the appearance of the '50s Cap was left unexplained, until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steve-englehart/26-42211/\">Steve Englehart</a> started on the book.</p><p>In 1953, a man named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/grand-director/29-14492/\">William Burnside</a> found the lost formula for the Super-Soldier Serum in Nazi files in a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/germany/34-55777/\">German</a> warehouse. This man idolized and almost worshiped Captain America. He had a Ph.D. in American History and he had done his thesis on Captain America. He immediately tells the government about the formula in exchange for becoming the next Captain America. He underwent plastic surgery to look like Steve Rogers and was set to be the symbol for the Korean War. However, the project was never finished, so \"Steve Rogers\" became a teacher.</p><p>While teaching, he finds a young student named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-monroe/29-7618/\">Jack Monroe</a> (eventually known as <a href=\"/jack-monroe/29-7618/\">Nomad</a>) who also is a huge Captain America fan. They use the formula on themselves and became the new Captain America and Bucky. They fight Communism, but they didn't know of the Vita-Ray process that was required to stabilize the recipient after taking the super soldier formula. Since they don't take it, it affected their minds and they became overly paranoid, attacking anyone they even have the slightest suspicion of being a Communist, seeing threats to America where none existed. The government quickly realized they were out of control, and shut them down, placing them in suspended animation. Years later they are freed by a disgruntled government employee. Newly awakened in the 1970's, they confront the real Captain America and his new partner, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a>.</p><p>Regarding the differences that underpinned this confrontation, Steve says, \"In this case, the comics mirrored their eras; the late '30s-early '40s Cap was a liberal and the early '50s Cap was a conservative. The first one looked up to Roosevelt; the second looked up to McCarthy. That's about as fundamental as it gets.\" Thus, it was not only a physical battle, but a battle of ideologies in which Cap confronted the impostor with just how out of touch and extreme he has become, and in doing so, manages to defeat him.</p><h3><b>Out of the Ice, the Modern Age</b></h3><p>Ironically, it was Cap's former Invaders teammate, <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>, who finds an Inuit tribe worshiping a frozen figure in a block of ice near the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Namor, seemingly enraged that they are worshiping an inanimate object, lifts the block of ice and hurls it into the sea. Apparently damaged by the impact of hitting the water, the ice began breaking apart revealing the frozen figure within as a man. The Avengers, who are still in the area, after battling the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> and Namor, spot this man floating in the water and pull him aboard their craft. They soon recognized the iconic uniform the man wore beneath his torn and tattered clothing and identified him. He was Steve Rogers, Captain America! The Avengers determined he was still alive and they revived him. Upon becoming conscious, Captain America didn't recognize any of the Avengers so he assumed they were Nazis and immediately sprung into action battling the entire team alone. Fortunately, the battle and misunderstanding ended quickly.</p><h3>Joining the Avengers</h3><p>From his impossibly youthful appearance and actions after his revival the Avengers determined he had been preserved in a state of suspended animation while frozen in the ice. Though he was out of his own time and unfamiliar with the modern world he is still at his. Recognizing his value as skilled fighter in combat, a great tactician, and a natural leader; the Avengers invite Captain America to join their team. The Living Legend of World War II accepted, and soon became team leader, a position he has held more times than anybody else. This was quickly followed by his own monthly gig in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tales-of-suspense/49-2007/\">Tales of Suspense</a> anthology, wherein he shared equal billing with Iron Man.</p><p>Cap appears in an extended run by Stan and Jack in which Captain America leads the Avengers for a long time, fighting their enemies and some of his old enemies-such as Baron Zemo. He finds out what had happened to Bucky, his young World War II partner, and is devastated. He was grief-stricken for many years. Shortly after Captain America's revival, honorary Avenger <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rick-jones/29-2248/\">Rick Jones</a> convinces Cap to let him become the new Bucky and partners with him for a short time. Captain America doesn't want to be responsible for another young partner's death. Just as he relents, and allows Rick to assume the Bucky identity, the Red Skull (Cap's arch-enemy from World War II) uses the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a> to drive Bucky away. Afterwards, the title's creative reins transferred over to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jim-steranko/26-31994/\">Jim Steranko</a>. A Silver Age stylist who helped redefine comic art expectations. One of his greatest Marvel triumphs was in the pages of Captain America! The issues of Cap #110, 111, 113 were packed with high drama, proportion expanding page layouts, and Steranko's sultry, spy-oriented action.</p><p>While acclimating to modern times Captain America became reacquainted with old friends and met with people with whom he became friends and allies. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Colonel Nick Fury</a> was a fellow veteran whom Cap had met and served with during World War II when Fury lead the Howling Commandos as a sergeant. They reunited, becoming friends and allies again. Fury now leads the intelligence agency <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a> and when situations beyond the capabilities of his agents cropped up, Fury would frequently ask Cap to undertake and complete these missions for S.H.I.E.L.D. Later, he meets Sam Wilson, an African-American social worker from Harlem whom Captain America met on Exile Island. Captain America trains Sam to become the Falcon and Captain America's new partner renaming his series Captain America and The Falcon. Throughout their partnership they combat numerous foes including the Grey Gargoyle, Scorpion, Mr. Hyde, The Serpent Gang and even the Red Skull.</p><h3>Nomad</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2120593\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100395/2120593-steve_rogers_the_nomad.png\" title=\"Steve Rogers as Nomad\"><img id=\"2120593\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100395/2120593-steve_rogers_the_nomad_medium.png\" alt=\"Steve Rogers as Nomad\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Steve Rogers as Nomad</div></div></div></div><p>A bit disillusioned, Captain America retired his mantle due to the Watergate scandal. Later he was convinced by Hawkeye to continue fighting evil leading him to adopt a new superhero persona; the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america-and-the-falcon-nomad/49-27518/\">Nomad</a>. However, after the death of the new Captain America, Roscoe, at the hands of the Red Skull, Steve realized that the costume is a powerful symbol of American ideals and not a tool for the government; he became Captain America once again. Relishing his return to his Captain America role, Steve nonetheless promises to never forget what he learned during his time as Nomad. Nest he fought the Red Skull once more and it was revealed that Red Skull had been a burned out youth in Germany before a chance meeting with Adolf Hitler himself. Seeing the inner anger and sensing his potential for evil, Hitler trained the boy to be his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and he eventually became the Red Skull. Captain America defeated the Red Skull again, preventing him from using his Dust of Death to first decimate the population and then to attempt the restart of the Third Reich with which to take over the world.</p><h3>U.S.Agent</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2271274\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/104050/2271274-the_many_looks_of_captain_america_20080129031638543_000.jpg\" title=\"Steve Rogers as The Captain\"><img id=\"2271274\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/104050/2271274-the_many_looks_of_captain_america_20080129031638543_000_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Rogers as The Captain\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Steve Rogers as The Captain</div></div></div></div><p>New enemies came, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flag-smasher/29-23138/\">Flag-Smasher</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scourge/29-14461/\">Scourge of the Underworld</a>. Captain America also resigns his role when the government tries to force him to work solely for them. They hired <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/usagent/29-14992/\">John Walker</a> to do his job when Rogers refused, taking the name of \u201cThe Captain.\u201d During this time Steve has some questionable run-ins with the law that made him realize how much credibility he had as Captain America. Sometimes he even had to resort to working outside the law as much as it pained him. Cap and Walker tussled a few times, until Walker was driven insane. He later became U. S. Agent and Steve Rogers once again became Captain America.</p><p>Later, it had been revealed that the chemicals that allowed the Red Skull to retain his youth had worn off, and now the Red Skull was in his 80's. The Red Skull had kidnapped several of Cap's closest allies including the Falcon, and forced Captain America to revert to his natural age by subjecting him to the same artificial aging process that he used to advance his own daughters age. The two had one final battle where they would battle as equals. Cap came out the victor but refused to kill the Red Skull, who died right after the battle of a heart attack. Cap's youth was one again restored by the Avengers.</p><h3>Cap Armor</h3><p>During the Streets of Poison story arc, Captain America had discovered that Avengers staff member Fabian Stankowicz had been on a new street drug called Ice. After suspending Fabian and sending him to rehab, Captain America had taken it upon himself to clean the streets of drug dealers. During a raid on a warehouse, a drug dealer blows the building up and Captain America finds himself caught in the fumes of Ice. Captain America finds himself hooked on the drug which makes him prone to violence and causes outburst of rage. Caught in a the middle of a turf war between The Kingpin and The Red Skull, Captain America's condition worsens until he subdued by Diamondback and The Black Widow. Captain America undergoes a blood transfusion to cleanse his blood of the drug; he is however temporarily stripped of the super soldier serum. Vowing to break the drug circle, Captain America heads to Yankee stadium where a final confrontation between the Red Skull and Kingpin occurs to determine who would control drug trafficking in New York. At the stadium Captain America is confronted by Crossbones, after a brutal fight Steve Rogers prevailed proving that even without the super soldier serum, he could still be Captain America.</p><p>However disaster strikes when Captain America avoids an explosion at a drug lab full of a chemical that causes a reaction with the Super-Soldier serum in his system. It alters his biochemistry, and he begins to deteriorate. He turns to Iron Man, who helps him by making a powered exoskeleton for him in the vein of the Iron Man armor. Eventually, he is cured by a transfusion of blood from none other then Red Skull, who had transferred his mind into a cloned body of Captain America.</p><h3>The Expatriate</h3><p>During the \u201cMan Without a Country\u201d story arc, Steve Rogers briefly dons the costume of The Expatriate. After The Red Skull brings Cap back to life he is filmed storming a military base alongside both the Red Skull and Sharon Carter. Bill Clinton temporarily exiles Rogers to the UK until the matter is sorted out and his name can be cleared. As not to associate himself with the United States, Steve wears an all-blue costume, similar to Isaiah Bradley\u2019s uniform, but with no stars or stripes. It is also at this time when Steve first receives the Plasma Shield, although it only forms a yellow buckler, as opposed to his later, more spangled Plasma Shield.</p><h3>The first Super Soldier: Red, White and Black</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"80185\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/80185-159074-isaiah-bradley_super.jpg\" title=\"One of Captain America's predecessors: Isaiah Bradley\"><img id=\"80185\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/80185-159074-isaiah-bradley_medium.jpg\" alt=\"One of Captain America's predecessors: Isaiah Bradley\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">One of Captain America's predecessors: Isaiah Bradley</div></div></div></div><p>Before Steve Rogers' participation in Project: Rebirth, the U.S. Army tested the early version of the Super Soldier Serum on 300 black soldiers. Black Americans were infected with syphilis, without their knowledge, and left untreated to study the effects of the disease on the human body. A married man and father to a newborn girl, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/isaiah-bradley/29-40607/\">Isaiah Bradley</a> was a infantryman at Camp Cathcart, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mississippi/34-56246/\">Mississippi</a> in 1942, during the first year of the United States involvement in World War II. Bradley's platoon is among the 300 test subjects that were randomly chosen from the two of the all black battalions are Cathcart which were murdered after the 300 left for Project Super Soldier. Barbaric medical practices are performed on the subjects. The surviving seven were sent forward to Europe, one of their number dying on the boat ride to complications with the serum. The remaining six entered the war in July 1942.</p><p>Bradley's only known costumed mission involved the destruction of the Nazi Super Soldier Project at Schwarzebitte, Germany in October 1942. Bradley steals a spare Captain America costume that had been set aside for Steve Rogers who was to lead the mission. He completed his mission, however he is captured and later interrogated by Hitler himself before being shipped off to Auschwitz. Bradley escaped and is taken in by the German and Belgian Underground Resistance. He is eventually able to sneak back to behind Allied lines in 1943, but receives a court-martial from the Army and a sentence to life imprisonment for stealing Captain America's costume. Bradley served seventeen years and was released by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the day of President <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-f-kennedy/29-33077/\">John F. Kennedy's</a> inauguration. Bradley was the only test subject to survive the war.</p><p>He became an underground legend among the Marvel African-American community - he was their Captain America. Eventually, however, the serum's long-term effects damaged Isaiah Bradley, in his body and mind. He became childlike and began to disappear as a hero. It was then that he is discovered by Steve Rogers, who tracks him down and acknowledges his sacrifices and heroism. Isaiah Bradley remains as one of Cap's greatest allies - the black Captain America. He is the grandfather of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patriot/29-2258/\">Elijah Bradley</a>, Patriot from the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a>.</p><h3>The New Avengers</h3><p>Eventually, the Avengers broke up, in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a> after the Scarlett Witch had a nervous breakdown and killed a few teammembers. For a few months there where no Avengers. Captain America however soon found himself in a situation that brought together many of New York's superheroes once again. Finding destiny to have struck twice, Captain America formed the New Avengers, together with Iron Man, Luke Cage, newcomers Sentry and Ronin and known superheroes such as Wolverine and Spider-man. Iron Man soon found a headquarters for the team and so the New Avengers where born.</p><h3>The Winter Soldier</h3><p>Rogers revealed his secret identity, but then a new villain, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Winter Soldier</a>, had shown himself. The Winter Soldier's secret identity turns out to be Bucky Barnes. Bucky had been saved by the Soviet Union, who brainwashed him and made him their super soldier and assassin. Eventually, Bucky's memory was returned to him and he once again became Cap's sidekick.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"159489\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7019/159489-20900-civil-war_super.jpg\" title=\"Cap and Iron Man: At odds during the superhero Civil War\"><img id=\"159489\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7019/159489-20900-civil-war_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cap and Iron Man: At odds during the superhero Civil War\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cap and Iron Man: At odds during the superhero Civil War</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a></p><p>A super-human battle in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stamford-ct/34-45571/\">Stamford</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/connecticut/34-56118/\">Connecticut</a> causes the deaths of hundreds of school children and leads directly to the superhero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a> when the public called out for super-humans to register their powers, abilities, and identities, and hang up the costumes. In the wake of this horrible tragedy, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-human Registration Act</a> is quickly passed. This new law requires everyone in the United States to register with the federal government, submit to evaluation, training and even become a government operative. Some heroes are for it while some were against it. Captain America is the most highly-respected hero against it. He believes it infringes on the rights and personal freedoms of super-humans.</p><p>He elects to lead the anti-registration faction of heroes against the pro-registration people, who are led by none other than his friend and fellow Avenger; Iron Man. Cap and the other heroes refusal to register immediately makes them all technically criminals and fugitives to be hunted down by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, police, their former friends, and even enemies/villains who'd registered and agreed to work as government operatives. The two factions clash several times with Iron Man beating Cap savagely in their first fight. However, as the War goes on, Cap's side grows by recruiting and attracting mostly street-level heroes like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, and later <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> (after he defects from Iron Man's pro-registration side). Captain America's faction even recruits one true powerhouse; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a>.</p><p>Eventually, Cap's anti-registration faction gained enough strength to match Iron Man's pro-registration forces. Captain's morals were sorely tested too, when he enlisted the help of many figures he would normally apprehend and turn over to the authorities. The most notable of these questionable allies were Frank Castle, a.k.a. the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> and Wilson Fisk, a.k.a. the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a>.</p><p>Eventually events lead to the final confrontation between the opposing factions where Captain America confronted and batters Iron Man. The tide of the battle was turning in favor of Captain America's forces and victory was at hand when a group of ordinary civilians intervene and attempt to restrain Cap. It was at this moment that Captain America realizes he was endangering the very people he had sworn to protect. \"We're not fighting for the people anymore. We're just...fighting.\" he said tearfully, surrendering even as he was about to win. Captain America then removed his mask, surrendered to authorities as Steve Rogers and orders the anti-registration forces to stand down. As Rogers is led away in handcuffs, the Punisher retrieves Captain America's discarded mask. The majority of the other anti-registration heroes subsequently elect to register, while some decide to take their chances, stay outside the law and remain fugitives. After his arrest, Captain America is incarcerated by the federal government to await trial.</p><p>The Civil War strains relationships between the former Avengers, too. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> was dead. Iron Man and Captain America led opposing forces. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> was on Iron Man's side, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> was on Cap's. Due to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch's</a> mental instability and breakdown the Avengers had been disassembled already (in <a href=\"/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a>), but the events of the Civil War made it nearly impossible for the team to reform and function effectively. Eventually, several different versions of the team either formed or re-formed as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a>.</p><h3><b>Fallen Son</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1072882\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7666/1072882-captain_america_stevedaily_bugle_fallen_son_super.jpg\" title=\"Captain America: Assassinated\"><img id=\"1072882\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7666/1072882-captain_america_stevedaily_bugle_fallen_son_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America: Assassinated\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Captain America: Assassinated</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/fallen-son-the-death-of-captain-america/49-18420/\">Fallen Son: The Death of Captain America</a></p><p>The tide of the superhuman Civil War turns, as Captain America is assassinated in a scheme perpetrated by his greatest foe, the Red Skull. It is later revealed that Steve Rogers is not dead. When S.H.I.E.L.D. and Tony Stark take possession of Captain America's body, and they wanted to conduct tests because he was the only perfect Super-Soldier. What they discover was the serum seems to have reversed the effects on his body after he died. Though his death demoralized even those he had fought against, the new order of super heroes had already begun, spearheaded by Iron Man, who had been appointed as the new director of S.H.I.E.L.D. with the launch of the Fifty State <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-initiative/65-42781/\">Initiative</a> program, Iron Man's dream of a dedicated super hero team in each U. S. state was being realized. Little did he suspect that the mounting Skrull invasion was secretly placing one of their agents on each of those teams. In Captain America: New Deal, Steve Rogers left instructions for Tony Stark in a letter written before his death to \"save\" Bucky and that the mantle of Captain America should go on.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"543948\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/543948-captainamerica1_super.jpg\" title=\"Bucky assumes Captain America's mantle\"><img id=\"543948\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/543948-captainamerica1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Bucky assumes Captain America's mantle\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Bucky assumes Captain America's mantle</div></div></div></div><p>When the Winter Soldier (Bucky) is brought into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody, he managed to escape, only to attack Iron Man. The two fight to a standstill until Stark mentions the letter from Steve. Bucky isn't sure that Cap had meant for him to actually become Captain America. Tony said that there's no way Bucky would let anyone else fill those boots and asked if he wanted to be the one to let Steve down. Bucky says he'd do it under two conditions. The first was that his mind would be completely probed to ensure there was no trace of brainwashing or fail safe code-words left over from when he was under control as the Winter Soldier. The second condition is that he doesn't have to answer to S.H.I.E.L.D. or to Stark, just as Steve didn't. Tony thought about it and agreed. The Norse god Thor later communicates with the spirit of Steve Rogers on the one-year anniversary of his death.</p><h3>Captain America Reborn</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1072303\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35258/1072303-reborn.jpg\" title=\"Reborn: Cap comes back!\"><img id=\"1072303\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35258/1072303-reborn_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Reborn: Cap comes back!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Reborn: Cap comes back!</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/captain-america-reborn/39-56014/\">Captain America Reborn</a></p><p>As the machinations of the Red Skull continue despite the intervention of the new Captain America, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> and the Falcon, he and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arnim-zola/29-14876/\">Arnim Zola</a> reveal to an astonished <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> that the gun <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sharon-carter/29-38227/\">Sharon Carter</a> used to kill Steve Rogers actually froze him in space and time at the moment of his death. That moment of spatial and temporal stasis could be used to bring back his body from any moment in the future via a modified version of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Dr. Doom's</a> time device and Sharon Carter herself, whom they referred to as \"the constant.\" At the time of the intended retrieval, Sharon's actions disrupted the process, resulting in Steve being lost in time and space. He is shown reliving moments of his past, most notably events during the Second World War, badly disoriented and bewildered. While going through the time stream, Steve finds himself back in 1944, at one of the Red Skull's bases, fighting Master Man. As he begins to fight Master Man, Cap figures out that he has somehow been sent back in time and reliving all of the battles he has fought in over the years.

While Reed does this, Hank mentions that Falcon and the Vision are out looking for Bucky and Black Widow, since they never returned from their mission. Reed then tells Hank that he has found something in Sharon's blood stream, Reed then mentions that there was something similar to what's in Sharon's blood, in Steve's body that Reed had found after he had done an autopsy on it. Reed then tells Hank that there was something Tony Stark didn't like about the rapid cellular decay in Steve's body.</p><p>Norman then meets with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crossbones/29-3225/\">Crossbones</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sin/29-28057/\">Sin</a>, telling them that he knows about the second shooter and that he would love to have a Captain America on his side, leading his Avengers, even if the Red Skull's mind was in that Captain America's body.</p><p>Back in the past, Steve finds himself back in 1940 with Dr. Erskine, Steve then begins to ask the doctor about time travel and what would happen if someone were to go back and kill Hitler before all of this madness began. Dr. Erskine then tells Steve that doing something like that would have both an action and reaction that could end up making it so that your loved ones might have never been born. After this, Steve is taken into a lab and is about to relive the moment he became Captain America, Steve knows that the doctor is going to be killed by a Nazi spy, but is forced to do nothing but go through with the experiment. After he does, the doctor is killed and Steve begins to ask himself why he is reliving all of his past memories.</p><p>Back at the H.A.M.M.E.R. Helicarrier, Norman is talking to the now captured Bucky and Black Widow, Norman then reveals that he had told the whole world that Sharon Carter was the second shooter in the assassination of Captain America and is now the world's most wanted. Norman then tells them that he is letting Black Widow go so that she could tell Sharon that if she doesn't turn herself in within twenty-four hours, Norman will kill Bucky.</p><p>Still trapped in time, Steve relives the time he was trapped in the ice, he begins to wonder why he even keeps track of the time anymore, since he believes time has no meaning for him now. As he ponders on this, Namor appears, as Steve knew he would, picking up the large chunk of ice that holds Steve. Everything happens like it always did, Namor throws the piece of ice into the water, even though Steve tries to yell Namor's name, to where Steve would be found by the Avengers. Back in the present, Reed Richards has met with Namor in the Arctic Ocean, where Steve's body was secretly laid to rest. Reed asks Namor to raise Steve's coffin, which Namor had already done, and as Reed examines Steve's body, the body disappears, shocking both Reed and Namor. As Reed tried to figure out what happened, he gets a call from Hank Pym, who tells Reed that Norman Osborn has outed Sharon Carter as the second shooter who killed Captain America, and to Black Widow's disapproval, Sharon tells them that she's going to turn herself in.</p><p>Elsewhere, Bucky is being transported by Norman's Thunderbolts, while Sharon tries to figure out what she should do.

Steve watches Iron Man, Thor, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a>, Steve then asks the Vision, who had asked him to meet with the other Avengers on the command deck, if the Vision could remember something and then store it deep in his memory storage, something Vision said he would have no problem doing. Back with Bucky, Falcon attacks the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts'</a> jet, fighting off the Thunderbolts, while the Thunderbolts' Ant-Man frees Bucky, after that Bucky and Falcon escape unharmed.</p><p>Still jumping through time, Steve finds himself reliving the time he and Rick Jones, who was going by the name of Bucky at the time, fight off a group of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hydra/65-3480/\">HYDRA</a> agents. Steve then feels the remorse of losing the original Bucky, his close friend James Barnes, when he almost calls Rick \"Bucky\". Back in the present, Norman Osborn has announced that Sharon Carter, Steve's lover, was the second shooter in his death. While he does this, Sharon is being taken to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a>.

In the English Channel Islands, 1945, Steve finds himself and Bucky escaping Baron Zemo's fortress. Bucky and Steve then jump onto the drone bomber that will explode, sending them to their apparent deaths, only to let them live to become who they are today. Steve, who has relived this day so many times in his mind, and nightmares, decides that he won't let Bucky get blown up again and become the Winter Soldier. As he tries to stop Bucky, Steve is suddenly pulled back through time, he then finds himself being attacked by the Red Skull as he flies through time.</p><p>Steve's body then appears in Dr. Doom's lab, but as Sharon calls out to him, it is revealed that the Red Skull has placed his mind in Steve's body, and is now in control of Captain America. Steve then finds himself in a nightmarish world ruled by the Nazis and the Red Skull. The Red Skull, who is now on his way to the White House to meet with the President to ruin Captain America and what he stands for once and for all. But as they make their way to D. C., the Skull captures the Vision who is trying to sneak on board to rescue Sharon, and commands his ship to attack the Avengers Quinjet which is chasing after them. The A.I.M. ship takes out the Quinjet, causing it to crash in front of the Lincoln Memorial.</p><p>The Avengers are forced to fight the Skull's forces. While that happens, Steve finds where the Skull is hiding in his mind, and they begin to fight over control of Steve's body. Meanwhile, Bucky fights the Red Skull outside of Steve's body. But Bucky shows that he can't kill Steve, even if it is the Red Skull controlling him. . The Red Skull then takes Bucky's shield, stating that \u201cwhat's Captain\nAmerica without his shield?\u201d He then cuts off Bucky's bionic hand, saying that it's time for a new morning in America. But before Red Skull can kill Bucky, Steve is able to force the Skull out of his mind and back into his robotic body, gaining control over his body again, and finally returning to the world he left.</p><p>Sharon Carter then uses one of Hank Pym's size changer devices to make the Red Skull into a giant, making sure he can't escape this time, Steve and Bucky then team up with the rest of the Avengers, fighting the giant Red Skull, and finally are able to seemingly kill the Red Skull. As they do so, the public sees Steve among the heroes, and yell with joy as they see that Captain America has returned. Back in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a>, Steve remembers that he saw the future while he was going through time, and that he believes Bucky is going to die, but before he can think about it more, Sharon comes to get him to come down to his party. Four days after his return, Steve had been training with Bucky, getting back into shape. He talks to Sharon, telling her how he's worried that he may slip away back into time again, she then tells him that he's not going anywhere and that she has him.</p><p>Later that night, Steve decides to suit up and go out into the city, to see what has changed. He finds Captain America (Bucky) and Black Widow as they fight the Hyde who has escaped from The Raft. As Hyde tries to escape from the battle, Bucky sees Steve watching from the sidelines and throws him his shield, allowing him to defeat Hyde all by himself. Steve then says that was fun and hands Bucky the shield, but Bucky refuses telling Steve that he's Captain America and that's his shield.</p><p>Steve then tells Bucky that they need to talk. Steve tells Bucky that he should keep being Captain America, that it means something more to him, which Bucky disagrees with, saying that Steve is the only Captain America. Steve then tells him that he's not sure if he's ready or will ever be able to pick up his shield again, and asks Bucky to continue being Captain America, if not for himself, then for him.</p><p>Steve then returns to Sharon, telling her that he believes that if Bucky doesn't continue to be Captain America, that he may die, and Steve could never live with that possibility, even if it means giving up the future he wants. Steve then meets with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/barack-obama/29-56661/\">President Obama</a>, who gives Steve a Presidential Pardon for what he did during the Civil War, saying that he felt the S.H.R.A. was un-American to him. Steve then tells the President that he may not be able to pick up his shield again, President Obama then tells Steve that that is okay, that he has a feeling that in the coming days, America is going to call on Steve for something much bigger.</p><h3>The Heroic Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192913\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38888/1192913-1271438409_super.jpg\" title=\"Commander Rogers\"><img id=\"1192913\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38888/1192913-1271438409_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Commander Rogers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Commander Rogers</div></div></div></div><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/the-heroic-age/39-56023/\">The Heroic Age</a></p><p>After the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-reign/39-55707/\">Dark Reign</a> of Norman Osborn and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a>, Steve Rogers is called on again for duty, but now as America's new \"Top Cop\" ( <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a>. director).

Steve's first line-up of Secret Avengers include his long-time love interest <a href=\"/sharon-carter/29-38227/\">Sharon Carter</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valkyrie/29-6809/\">Brunnhilde the Asgardian Valkyrie</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova/29-2105/\">Nova</a> the Prime Centurion of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xandar/34-56106/\">Xandarian</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova-corps/65-40482/\">Nova Corps</a>, former Avenger and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">X-Man Beast</a>, <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moon-knight/29-1493/\">Moon Knight</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/war-machine/29-1926/\">War Machine</a>.</p><h3><b>Steve Rogers: Super Soldier</b></h3><p><b>For further details:</b> <a href=\"/steve-rogers-super-soldier/49-34244/\">Steve Rogers: Super Soldier</a></p><p>Steve Rogers meets with <a href=\"/pete-wisdom/29-14819/\">Pete Wisdom</a> in a diner who shows Steve files about a witness from Nextin Pharmaceuticals who was killed in a car explosion. Wisdom informs Steve that a Professor Jacob Erskine apparently works for the company. Steve claims Professor Erskine never had a son. Wisdom reveals that this is his grandson taking back the family name. He is the son of Professor Erskine's estranged daughter Esme and a man by the name <a href=\"/tyler-paxton/29-74197/\">Tyler Paxton</a>. Steve Rogers knew Paxton from the Super Soldier program and was friends with him a long time ago. Wisdom goes on to inform Steve that apparently Jacob Erskine has cracked the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/18-55976/\">Super Soldier serum</a> and plans on selling it to the highest bidder. This intel forces Steve to head out to Madripoor. Steve uses his advanced training to gain entrance to the building.</p><p>Once inside he changes into a suit to blend into the crowd as he begins to look for Jacob Erskine. He finally locates him within the crowd but notices he is accompanied by a woman he recognizes from his past which forces him to change tactics. As Jacob and the woman enter the elevator, Steve takes out the two guards guarding the elevator and proceeds to follow them up the stairs. When he reaches the next level, he runs into three bodyguards who he's forced to engage. Steve quickly realizes these men have already been injected without he Super Solider serum which angers him, causing him to lose his concentration. Steve eventually defeats the men, one of which began to have an aneurism. Steve uses a device <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Hank McCoy</a> designed for him to test the mans blood.</p><p>He finds out his thoughts are correct and proceeds to find Jacob Erskine. Jacob was awaiting Steve's arrival in his office. Steve asks why he's doing this, asking if it's all just for revenge. Jacob is surprised at his accusations and claims his purpose was to cure cancer. Steve doesn't believe a word he's saying as he tells him that his men are already injected without he serum. This surprised Jacob who seemed to know nothing about this. Moments later a bullet was fired through the window hitting Jacob who fell into Steve's arms.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1995195\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68543/1995195-ss2_super.jpg\" title=\"Commander Rogers\"><img id=\"1995195\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68543/1995195-ss2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Commander Rogers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Commander Rogers</div></div></div></div><p>Gun fire continues to blast through the windows. Jacob Erskine's final words were to ask Steve to protect his wife. He thinks they will come after her next. Steve hears armed security coming towards the room forcing him to exit through the window. After a rough landing, he begins to scour the Madripoor underworld for a lead on the shooter who had already vacated the room adjacent to the building Jacob Erskine was killed in. After not being able to find a single lead, Steve is forced to assume that this was an inside job. Sharon calls Steve who is hiding in one of Wolverine's safe houses and asks him if he wants help. He refuses but doesn't tell her the real reason he doesn't want her help. Steve follows Jacob's wife Anita who is being moved to a house on the beach by Nextin security. Once she's alone, Steve approaches her.</p><p>She asks Steve if she knows him because she thinks she's dreamt about him before. Steve tells her his name and she gets a feeling of deja vu and claims that they used to be in love. She then proceeds to kiss him and Steve pulls away quickly. Anita asks why he's in her head and then runs away. Sharon then calls Steve with intel on Myron Smith claiming that there is no Myron Smith. All his records are forged and he never existed until a year ago. Steve begins to put the pieces together and enters the beach house and approaches Smith face to face. He tells him to cut the act and moments later <a href=\"/machinesmith/29-28676/\">Machinesmith</a> reveals himself to be behind everything. Anita and Myron were both androids. Suddenly Steve is hit by an energy beam of some sort which deactivated the Super Soldier Serum inside him.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1995197\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68543/1995197-ss3_super.jpeg\" title=\"Deactivated Super-Soldier\"><img id=\"1995197\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68543/1995197-ss3_medium.jpeg\" alt=\"Deactivated Super-Soldier\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Deactivated Super-Soldier</div></div></div></div><p>Steve is taken to a lab and strapped down to a table. Machinesmith tells Steve how he convinced Jacob to change his last name to Erskine to lure Steve into a trap. Machinemsith promises to sell the serum on the market. Steve begins yelling forcing security to knock him out. He awakes to find himself in a cell. His comm-link is out. Unable to contact anyone and with no idea what will happen next, he kills time by doing some push-ups and sit-ups. Machinesmith enters the room via holographic projection and tells Steve he no longer has any need for him. At that moment, security enters the room and takes Steve at gunpoint. Steve is forced to use his years of combat experience and defend himself. A de-powered Steve is able to overthrow the guards and heads to the laboratory to active Anita. Anita takes Steve to the room where the Super Soldier tests are conducted.</p><p>She activates the vita rays which enable the serum in Steve's veins allowing him to dismantle the guards entering the room at that moment with little effort. Steve and Anita head out to the airfield base where Machinesmith plans on meeting with terrorists and sell the serum. Machinesmith begins his demonstration by showing the vials of serum to all the interested buyers who showed up. Outside, Steve and Anita arrive but security is hesitant to let Anita through. She finally convinces him but he alerts Machinesmith of her arrival. Steve enters the building and engages Machinesmith in combat.</p><p>He cuts his head off which of course doesn't kill Machinesmith who is capable of jumping from electronic device to another at will. Steve throws a grenade to cause a distraction and buy time for Anita who was blocking satellite reception in the building. With every electronic system on the base destroyed, Machinesmith's only option is to transfer into Anita who reconfigured her system only allowing wireless traffic in and not out. She then proceeds to self-destruct. The next day Steve is back at <a href=\"/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> HQ reminiscing about the old days when <a href=\"/sharon-carter/29-38227/\">Sharon</a> enters the room. She tells Steve that Hank has a report for him so they head to the lab.</p><p>Hank tells Steve that what Machinesmith was presenting to the buyers was not the Super Soldier Serum. Steve is perplexed at this intel and wonders what the mission was really about. In Detroit, Michigan two men are in a car. One asks the other if he's sure the serum works now. The other man says it does and that they only needed a sample of Steve's blood to confirm it. It is revealed that the second man is Jacob Erskine who was thought to be killed. The two men watch a young seventeen year old boy who they claim has a similar history to Steve's. They claim the <a href=\"/shadow-council/65-57698/\">Shadow Council</a> will soon have an army of Super Soldiers and drive off.</p><p><b>Fear Itself</b></p><p>During the <i>Fear Itself</i> storyline, Steve Rogers is present when the threat of the Serpent is known. Following the apparent death of Bucky at the hands of Sin (in the form of Skadi), Steve Rogers ends up changing into his Captain America outfit. When the Avengers and the New Avengers are fighting Skadi, the Serpent ends up joining the battle and breaks Captain America's shield with his bare hands. Captain America and the Avengers teams end up forming a militia for a last stand against the forces of the Serpent. When it comes to the final battle, Captain America uses Thor's hammer to fight Skadi until Thor manages to kill the Serpent. In the aftermath of the battle, Iron Man presents Captain with his reforged shield now stronger for its uru-infused enhancements despite the scar it bears. It is then revealed that Captain America, Nick Fury, and Black Widow are the only ones who know that Bucky actually survived the fight with Skadi as Bucky resumes his identity as Winter Soldier.</p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men</h3><p>When Steve learns that the Phoenix Force is coming for Hope and learns that Cyclops is ready to take the risk and will allow the Force to come to Hope,he right away takes the Avengers to Utopia to tell Scott that that is too risky and they cannot take such a big risk.When Cyclops tells Steve that the Phoenix Force has being doing only good during the years,Cap tells him the risks and Cyclops starts the attack against Steve Rogers and the Avengers.Later when Steve sees that they cannot win this war he uses their only hope,Wanda Maximoff.They are able to take Hope but a lot of Avengers are being held captive in a prison in Utopia.Later when Steve has no other hope he tries to gather the Illuminati again but not all of them come,Namor is the one that doesn't come but the others come and go because they don't have hope or they believe that the Phoenix Force is actually good.But later when everybody's gone Namor comes.</p><h2>Personal Information</h2><h3>Physical Attributes</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'2\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 240 lbs.</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Blonde</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Publicly known</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> \"Top Cop\" of America, adventurer; former public works artist, special <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> operative, freelance illustrator, police officer, history teacher, sparring partner, soldier, WPA artist</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Manhattan, New York City, New York</li><li><b>Education:</b> High school graduate; one year of art school; military basic training; private tutoring in hand-to-hand combat, gymnastics, military strategy, piloting, demolition, and other disciplines</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> Steven Rogers (Captain America, ancestor, deceased), Joseph and Sarah Rogers (parents, deceased)</li></ul><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><h3>Powers</h3><h4>Super-Soldier Serum</h4><p>In the beginning the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/18-55976/\">Super-Soldier Serum</a> increased his body to the physical peak of human potential but not to any higher to super human levels. He is as strong, fast, durable and agile as any human could be. His reflexes have also been increased to peak human potential and are nearly instantaneous. He has run a mile in roughly a minute and bench-pressed 1200 pounds. Another major enhancement provided is the serum prevents the build-up of fatigue poisons in his muscles. This means he effectively never tires, making it possible for him to perform at his maximum ability when doing anything physical for an extraordinary length of time. However Captain America has displayed feats that would appear to be far outside the limits of a human being. One of Captain Americas most recent durability feats is him surviving a 200ft fall on top of a car from an airplane and he suffered no discomfort. In recent comics Captain America is being classified as having superhuman strength and agility. Whether or not Marvel will continue to classify him this way is unknown.</p><p>The serum also enhances his constitution, making him immune or highly resistant to many diseases and increasing the speed at which he heals from injuries and recuperates from illness. The serum is constantly being replenished by his body. Cap is a master of many martial arts and has developed his own fighting-style which melds jujitsu, boxing, judo, karate, pressure points, all-terrain acrobatics and the use of his shield. His sensory perceptions have also been enhanced by the Super-Solider Serum, making them as acute as possible short of being superhuman. Cap is a great leader, field commander, and tactician. He led the Avengers for a long time, and his great experience makes him great on the battlefield. He gives orders like a sergeant. He also creates the plans for the Avengers, and has a great fighting spirit. All this means he regularly defeats enemies much stronger than him and can go toe-to-toe with foes as powerful as Spider-Man.</p><h3><b>Paraphernalia</b></h3><h4>Equipment</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1647932\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64034/1647932-untitled3_undefined.jpg\" title=\"Captain America's Shield\"><img id=\"1647932\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64034/1647932-untitled3_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Captain America's Shield\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Captain America's Shield</div></div></div></div><p>Captain America is usually seen with his Captain America armor that is bullet proof and is red, white, and blue.

He became a hero due to the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/18-55976/\">Super-Soldier serum</a> and fought in World War II. His sidekick is <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky</a>, who photographs him and writes articles about him but isn't a costumed fighter. Eventually, a prototype hydrogen bomb, that he was disarming, explodes and throws him into the Atlantic Ocean, putting him in suspended animation. He is discovered fifty years later by <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a>, and becomes a hero. He is a little different, he is more conservative and a little more violent then the 616 version, using sidearms and explosives. He is still an amazing physical fighter and has a pure <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adamantium/18-40759/\">Adamantium</a> shield. Cap is selected to join the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimates/65-40504/\">Ultimates</a>, the Ultimate version of the Avengers, and he becomes team leader. He dates <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a>. Later, it appears he has betrayed the team, so <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> catches him and incarcerates him before learning <a href=\"/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> did it. She leads the <a href=\"/liberators/65-51531/\">Liberators</a> to destroy America. Cap joins the resistance and kills the Liberator's leader. Later, <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> would ask Cap to train the supposed mutant, <a href=\"/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>. He does so, but later finds out that Fury lied to him and that Fury has not let the Panther go home.</p><p>With the help of Tony Stark, Steve makes himself a Black Panther and joins the Ultimates as the Panther and allows T'Challa to go home. Later in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Lands</a> while battling the Juggernaut, the rest of the team finds out that the Black Panther they know had been Cap the whole time. When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimatum/39-55745/\">ULTIMATUM</a> Wave hits New York City, Cap is saved by Iron Man, but collapses and is taking to the Triskelion and put on life support. Cap later joins Thor in Valhalla, helping him fight Hela the goddess of death for Valkyrie's soul. Captain America ultimately survives the events of Ultimatum.Post-Ultimatum, Captain America and Hawkeye are on a mission when Cap runs into the Ultimate version of the Red Skull. They battle aboard a helicopter and Cap is quickly and brutally beaten by his adversary. The Red Skull whispers something in to Cap's ear. The Red Skull is actually Cap's son and Cap is currently a fugitive on the run from Nick Fury's (ultimate) Avengers.</p><p>Ultimate Captain America can lift 2-4 Tons, and is stronger than his 616 counterpart. His fighting ability however is inferior to his 616 counterpart. Ultimate Captain America came close to beating Ultimate Hulk, though he actually lost the fight. Ultimate Captain America has also shown a high level intellect in most of his fights. His physical appearance is identical (with the exception of the helmet wings) to his 616 counterpart.</p><h3>Earth-9997</h3><p>The Earth X version of Captain America was hardly Cap at all. He was a war-torn, old hero, with an American flag for a top and a shaved head. He sacrificed his life to save Captain Marvel, who needed a little help. This was a dismal version of the Captain. After the death of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/death/29-12620/\">Death</a>, Marvel created a universe for those who had died called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradise-x/39-44817/\">Paradise</a>, one in which, with the help of a part of the Cosmic Cube, each person could live in their own universe. In this Paradise, Captain America was one of the Avenging Hosts. His role was to reveal to the people still in the Realm of the Dead that they were actually dead.</p><h3>Earth-2149 (Marvel Zombies)</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/39-40611/\">Marvel Zombies</a> reality, Cap was known as Colonel America, and he was the President of the United States. After being turned into a zombie, he raided secret government bunkers and ate countless people until the zombie Red Skull killed him, by scooping his brains out.</p><p>In Marvel Zombies 2, we see the return of Colonel America. A Frankenstein experiment carried out by the X-Man Forge, allowed the brain of Colonel America to be transplanted into the body of the Black Panther's son T'Channa.</p><h3>Earth-460/Earth-311</h3><p>In Earth-460, the Purple Man had become president of the United States. He somehow sent Captain America to the year 1602 of an alternate reality, which created a divergent time-line designated Earth-311. In Earth-311 at the year 1602, Steve Rogers became Rojhaz, and joined an American Indian tribe. His arrival screwed up the time-line, and people started appearing in 1602 as analogues of themselves. Rojhaz didn't want to leave, so he could create a prejudice-free USA, but 1602 Nick Fury forced him to go back to normal time and bring everything back to normal.</p><h3>House of M</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> story line, Captain America (Steve Rogers) never got frozen in the ice-berg that kept him youthful in modern times. Instead, Steve Rogers continued to fight alongside the Invaders (Namor, Human Torch 1, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miss-america/29-13779/\">Miss America</a> and others) and protected the United States from all sorts of trouble and destruction. Steve Rogers gives up his mantle as Captain America after an argument with Senator McCarthy over the persecution of Mutants - particularly of Human Torch 1. He then joins the Space Program and becomes the first man to walk on the moon (changing Neil Armstrong's famous line to \"One small step for man, one giant leap for for peace between man and mutant-kind). Although he marries Peggy Carter, they split up after an argument over Steve's stance on S.H.E.I.L.D and Mutant persecution. In the end, Steve retires from the service, and is accosted by a group of young mutants who beat him in a subway station.</p><h3>Earth-982 (MC 2 Universe)</h3><p>In the MC2 universe, Cap's origin and suspended animation was exactly the same. Once he had joined the MC2 Avengers, they went on a perilous mission that claimed most of their lives. Cap stayed behind to help others on the mission and was considered missing in action. Later, he gave <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/american-dream/29-3371/\">American Dream</a> his shield, as he saw in her the dedication he had when he was fighting. Steve was last seen leading the young superheroes against their superhero parents who were being mind-controlled by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> . He was fatally injured, but in order to preserve his legacy, Thor used his power to immortalize him by turning him into a star resembling his shield to honor him.</p><h3>Earth-2301 (Mangaverse)</h3><p>In the Marvel Mangaverse, Captain America is both the leader of the Avengers and the president of the United States. He was killed by Doctor Doom. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a> (Ms Marvel in 616) becomes the new Cap.</p><h3>Earth-398</h3><p>Steve Rogers of Earth-398 was known as Yeoman America and was a member of the Queen's Vengeance.</p><h3>Earth-1298 (Mutant X)</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-x/49-6217/\">Mutant X</a> reality, a mutant took the name of <a href=\"../../captain-america-mutant-x/29-72663/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America (Mutant X)</a>, and was a member of The Six. He was killed by the Beyonder.</p><h3>Earth-9811</h3><p>In this reality, also called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/battleworld/34-51065/\">Battleworld</a>, Captain America and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> had a daughter called Crusader.</p><h3>Earth-9602 (Amalgam)</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amalgam-comics/57-2014/\">Amalgam</a> Universe, Captain America was merged with Superman. The new character was called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-soldier/29-47079/\">Super-Soldier</a>. Captain America(or rather Super-Soldier's) shield was replaced with Superman's logo, and is missing the top part of his mask piece, revealing his hair.

When the real Charnel surfaces, the Avengers and DH II team up, and manage to defeat Charnel. Captain America is killed along with most of this reality's Avengers in the process.</p><h3>Earth-1720</h3><p>In this reality Captain America is known as Captain Hydra. He's the warrior of Hand. In this world Hydra rules the world.</p><h2><b>Other Media</b></h2><h3><b>Film</b></h3><h4>Captain America</h4><p><b>For further detail:</b> <a href=\"/captain-america/223-60/\">Captain America</a></p><p>The film starts in 1936 when a fascist government kidnaps a talented boy from his family. The boy is needed for an experimental project to create a fascist super soldier; however, Dr. Vaselli (Carla Cassola) objects to using the boy, and under the cover of gunfire, flees.</p><p>Seven years later, the American government finds a volunteer in Steve Rogers, a loyal all-American that is excluded from the draft because of his illness. The formula successfully transforms Rogers into the perfect solider. Before any more super soldiers can be created using the formula kept in her head, Dr. Vaselli is murdered by a Nazi spy. Meanwhile, the Italian boy has become the Red Skull and is planning to launch a missile at the White House. Now code named Captain America, he is sent in to defeat the Skull and deactivate the missile.</p><p>However, after a brutal battle, the Red Skull tricks and defeats Captain America and ties him to the missile as it is about to launch. Cap is able to grab hold of the Red Skull, forcing him to cut off his hand in order to avoid being launched into destruction with Cap. While the missile is overhead, a young boy named Thomas Kimball takes a photograph as Cap forces the missile to change course and land, where he remains frozen until 1993.</p><p>Kimball goes on to become an honest politician and Vietnam War hero until being elected the President. In 1993, a year into his term, he is pushing for pro-environmentalist legislation that is angering the military-industrial complex, who hold a secret conference led by the Red Skull.</p><p>After the War, the Red Skull had extensive plastic surgery done in a partially successful attempt to alter his disfigured features, raised a daughter, and became the leader of a powerful crime family. In the 1960s, this American military-industrial complex hired the Red Skull and his thugs to murder various Americans who were against their militarism and Red Skull's fascism, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martin-luther-king/29-38841/\">Dr. Martin Luther King</a>, President John F. Kennedy and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robert-kennedy/29-35658/\">Robert Kennedy</a>. Now, Red Skull is targeting President Kimball for assassination.</p><p>Cap's frozen body is found by researchers, and he awakens still thinking that it is the 1940s. After battling some of the Red Skull's thugs, he brushes off Sam Kolawetz (Ned Beatty), a reporter and childhood friend of President Kimball, and hitchhikes his way back to his wartime girlfriend, Bernice (Kim Gillingham), in the movie.</p><p>While Bernice still lives at her old residence, she has long since married and raised her own daughter, Sharon. Sharon subsequently shows a series of VHS history tapes in order for Cap to catch up on what has happened while he was frozen in ice. Meanwhile, the Red Skull's thugs, lead by his daughter, break into Bernice's house and kill her. They also cause her husband to have a heart attack during their efforts to find where Cap is hiding out.

He continuously tries to join the Army and is continuously rejected for various health and physical issues. When he attended the Stark World Expo, on a double date with his friend <a href=\"/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">James Barnes</a>, his date is not happy with him because of his weak appearance. He tries to enlist again, and for the first time he is allowed to by <a href=\"/abraham-erskine/29-43681/\">Dr.Abraham Erskine</a>, who overheard the conversation between Steve and Bucky and the good heart and will that Steve has. He is recruited into <a href=\"/project-rebirth/12-55761/\">Project: Rebirth</a>, a super soldier experiment to win the war. <a href=\"/general-phillips/29-43985/\">General Phillips</a> is not happy with Erskine's choice in Steve being the right person for this procedure. The night before the procedure, Steve gets an unexpected meeting from Erskine, who reveals to him about <a href=\"/red-skull/29-2250/\">Johann Schmidt</a>, the first super soldier, who went through an imperfect version of the serum and gained super-human abilities but also suffered side-effects, as well as revealing that a \"Strong man who has known power all his life, loses the respect for that power, but a weak man knows the value of strength and knows compassion.\" Steve goes through the treatment and transforms into a much stronger and taller human being, a Super Solider. After this procedure Erskine is killed by an assassin of Schimdt's, <a href=\"/heinz-kruger/29-68691/\">Heinz Kruger</a>. Steve chases and captures the assassin, who commits suicide before an actual interrogation. Rather than use him in the Battlefield he is toured across the nation to promote war bonds as \" <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>\", since he is the last and only success of the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/18-55976/\">Super Soldier Serum</a>.

Steve infiltrates the <a href=\"/hydra/65-3480/\">Hydra</a> base and frees the captured soldiers alongside Barnes.

He jumps on board Schimdt's secret weapon, and confronts him. During their fight Steve damages the container of the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Tesseract</a>. In doing this, Schimdt for the first time grabs the Tesseract, which causes him to vanish into a bright light. Steve seeing no safe way to land the plane. with the bombs and weapons on board, makes a a daring decision to crash the plane into the Arctic. He is later found and awakens in a hospital room. He quickly figures out something is wrong, because of the baseball game in the radio. He flees out of the room into a present New York, which takes him by surprise and is confronted by <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> who informs Steve that he was asleep for almost 70 years.

He is informed about <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> and how he stole the <a href=\"/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Tesseract</a>, to conquer Earth, to which Steve is not thrilled to learn about especially the Tesseract, <a href=\"/hydra/65-3480/\">Hydra's</a> secret weapon and power source. Even though he accepts the mission, he tells Fury \"you should have left it in the ocean\", when asked about any important information on the Tesseract. Aboard the <a href=\"/avengers-quinjet/18-53156/\">Quinjet</a>, Steve is debriefed on each member of the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers Initiative</a>, and one in particular intrigues him, <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Bruce Banner</a>. He was informed by <a href=\"/agent-coulson/29-70860/\">Agent Coulson</a> that Banner tried to recreate the <a href=\"/super-soldier-serum/18-55976/\">Super Soldier Serum</a>, which he believed low levels of Gamma Radiation to be the key.

While Loki is about to kill an old man, Captain America intervenes and battles Loki, to which Loki has the upper hand even though Cap is not giving up, eventually Loki gives up, after the intervention of Iron Man. While escorting Loki to SHIELD, Steve is uncomfortable over how easy it was to capture him, but before he could go any further they are interrupted by the arrival of <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, who has come to earth to take his brother and the Tesseract back to <a href=\"/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a>. While Thor and Iron Man are battling each other on the ground, Rogers gets ready to jump off the Quinjet, to which Natasha informs him is a dangerous idea because of them being Gods and far more powerful than he is, to which he replies \"There's only one God ma'am, and I don't think he looks like that!\". He stops the fight between Tony and Thor, but angers Thor to attack him, to no avail because of Rogers <a href=\"/captain-americas-shield/18-50737/\">shield</a>. On board the Helicarrier the team listens to the conversation between Fury and Loki. Rogers discovers that SHIELD has possession of Hydra tech from World War Two and information on Phase 2, to create weapons of mass destruction powered by the Tesseract just like Hydra, which turns into an argument over the roles of each member and Tony's characteristic as a hero, leading them to be oblivious about the attack on the Helicarrier. While the Hulk is rampaging inside the Helicarrier and Thor is trying to stop him, Steve and Tony try to restart one of the Helicarrier engines.

He decided to create Spider-Man as a character with whom teens could identify, as there was a recent surge in teenage demand for comics. Lee was supposedly inspired for the concept of Spider-Man after observing a spider climb up a wall. Lee had to convince publisher <a href=\"/martin-goodman/26-43801/\">Martin Goodman</a> to\nintroduce Spider-Man in the last issue of the canceled\nseries <a href=\"/amazing-adult-fantasy/49-2043/\">Amazing Adult Fantasy</a>, which was renamed <a href=\"/amazing-fantasy/49-5533/\">Amazing Fantasy</a> for that issue\n(#15, Aug. 1962). Lee then approached legendary artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>\nfor an initial character design. However Lee was dissatisfied with Kirby\u2019s\nattempt as the character turned out to be too heroic and Spider-Man was\nsupposed to be a teenage boy. Lee then turned to <a href=\"/steve-ditko/26-4026/\">Steve Ditko</a> who developed the\nnow iconic look of Spider-Man.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Peter Parker originally decided to use his powers to make money but after Uncle Ben's death he decided to use his powers for good. In many ways, this makes Spider-Man less of the 'boy scout' character people think, the fact that he used his powers to have fun in the first place is something people can relate to. Initially, Peter Parker is shy and timid, but the Spider-Man alter-ego was a form of liberation and heroism, and he used it to gain confidence. However, he found the moral urge later, though some of his confidence and liberation remains, making him a sarcastic wise-guy.</p><p>He has a extremely powerful moral urge for good which is so strong that it made him stop working for the Pro-Registration side despite having his mentor and friends on said side.</p><p>He also has a very compassionate disposition that it can be said that he isn't just the most compassionate in the Marvel Universe but also one of the most compassionate period.</p><p>One thing he is well known for is his humor something that has been known to greatly irritate his enemies and has sometimes even let him win the fight. Furthermore The combination of moral obligation, compassion, and humor makes him one of the most trustworthy, good people to hang out with.</p><p>The time between Spider-Man capturing the burglar that killed Uncle Ben and him becoming a superhero was told over 30 years after his origin when the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/amazing-fantasy/49-5533/\">Amazing Fantasy</a> series was continued in 1995 by writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurt-busiek/26-41741/\">Kurt Busiek</a> (#16-18, Dec. 1995 \u2013 Mar. 1996). After catching the burglar that killed Ben, Peter had given up being Spider-Man as it reminded him of his irresponsible behavior that ultimately led to his uncle\u2019s death. Even though <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maxie-shiffman/29-25215/\">Maxie Shiffman</a>, the agent he had hired when he was a costumed wrestler, was putting out ads to track down Spider-Man, Peter didn\u2019t want anything to do with that life. Ben had been the only earner in the family and after his death Peter and his Aunt May were struggling for money. A salesman tried to con May into buying furniture that Ben had apparently left a deposit on before his death. Although the salesman had seemed genuine at the time, Peter caught <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-vale/29-83138/\">Mr. Vale</a> pulling the same stunt on an old widower when he was swinging through the city in his Spider-Man costume to clear his head. Spidey followed Mr. Vale to a warehouse where he discovered a whole gang of organized criminals led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-undertaker/29-83137/\">The Undertaker</a>. Spidey challenged the gang and soon had them rounded up for the police. Chronologically this was the first time Spider-Man had been threatened with a gun. More significantly, during the fight he discovered his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-sense/12-56106/\">Spider-Sense</a> for the first time. Capturing these criminals lead Peter to believe that this is how he has to make up for Uncle Ben\u2019s death, by using his powers to help others.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2349326\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2349326-spider_man2.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'.\"><img id=\"2349326\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2349326-spider_man2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man's first encounter with a 'super'.</div></div></div></div><p>Spider-Man became a force for good, from stopping muggings to rescuing workers at a construction site. These heroic activities also gained him positive media attention but he still didn\u2019t want to get back in show business. Even after Shiffman told him they could make millions, Peter chose responsibility over money. His heroism had also earned Spidey a certain fan named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flash-thompson/29-1489/\">Flash Thompson</a>. Spider-Man soon encountered another teenager with superpowers of her own and he and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/josephine-pulaski/29-25313/\">Joey Pulaski</a> became friends. However it turned out that Joey was working for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">The Kingpin</a> and the friends inevitably clashed, resulting in Joey\u2019s defeat and arrest. Although portrayed as just a misguided kid, chronologically Joey Pulaski was the first super powered being Spider-Man had encountered.</p><p>After defeating Joey Spider-Man\u2019s fame rose further. One day after seeing his aunt continue to struggle with the household finances, Peter finally decided he had to bring in some money. He contacted Maxie Shiffman who booked him an interview on a TV show. Spider-Man was given the slot of astronaut <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-jameson/29-4456/\">John Jameson</a> much to the vexation of his father, publicist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. As the host began to introducing the show\u2019s guests he was attacked by the super powered villain <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supercharger/29-41244/\">Supercharger</a>, who announced he will kill everyone in the audience to prove how dangerous super powered beings were. Spidey had never encountered a super villain before and thought real super heroes should deal with this. He attempted to call <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">The Fantastic Four</a> but after Supercharger attacked someone in the audience, Spider-Man stepped in and defeated his first super villain\u2026 \u201cbecause that\u2019s what super heroes do\u201d.</p><h2><b>Major Story Arcs</b></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2056898\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2056898-uncle_ben_death.jpg\" title=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\"><img id=\"2056898\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2056898-uncle_ben_death_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Peter mourning Uncle Ben's Death</div></div></div></div><p>Peter's first super-villain confrontation was with a communist spy called the <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon</a> who could disguise himself as anyone. He attempted to disguise himself as Spider-Man and steal some important documents but he was defeated by the debuting hero, restoring his good name. Peter went on to get a job at the Daily Bugle as a photographer, selling photos to J. Jonah Jameson even though they were usually used against him. He eventually fought his second super villain, <a href=\"../../vulture/29-4459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Vulture</a>. Due to his inexperience, Spider-Man was defeated but when the villain got cocky, Spider-Man used a gadget of his own to defeat The Vulture. Spider-Man then had his first confrontation with his most dangerous villain yet, the tentacled madman known as <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus</a>. Spider-Man was defeated by the more powerful Doctor Octopus in their initial encounter which caused Peter to doubt himself for the first time. He was encouraged by a speech given by the Human Torch to keep on fighting. Spidey managed to defeat the villain by knocking him out with one punch to the jaw, since Ock's powers came only from his tentacles. He would follow up this victory by fighting the shape shifting <a href=\"/sandman/29-3544/\">Sandman</a>, the lethal <a href=\"/lizard/29-1488/\">Lizard</a>, who is actually Peter's mentor and friend Curt Connors, the <a href=\"/enforcers/65-32265/\">Enforcers</a>, <a href=\"/electro/29-3228/\">Electro</a>, <a href=\"/mysterio/29-4333/\">Mysterio</a>, <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\">Kraven the Hunter</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>, and his soon to-be arch-nemesis the <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Green Goblin</a>.</p><p>After being defeated on two more occasions by Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus became more determined to defeat his foe and formed the <a href=\"../../sinister-six/65-40429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinister Six</a>, a group consisting of five other villains who all share the same grudge against the young hero. Ock had each villain face Spider-Man individually so that every member could reap the glory of Spider-Man's death, but he secretly devised this plan to ensure the other villains' defeat each time. After rendering Spider-Man tired, Otto lured him to a fight by kidnapping <a href=\"/aunt-may/29-1780/\">Aunt May</a> and <a href=\"/betty-brant/29-2484/\">Betty Brant</a>. Despite everything, Spider-Man came out victorious and saved the two hostages. On his high school graduation, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"/molten-man/29-11554/\">Molten Man</a>, who would turn out to be the stepbrother of <a href=\"/liz-allan/29-15408/\">Liz Allen</a>. During his early career, Spider-Man would frequently team up with other heroes such as <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a>, <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">the X-Men</a>, the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, and the <a href=\"/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a> in particular. Peter and Betty broke up after her brother was killed. She couldn't bear the thought of losing another loved one as she feared that Peter would die while taking pictures of Spider-Man. She later settled in with <a href=\"/ned-leeds/29-12354/\">Ned Leeds</a>.</p><h3><b>College Years</b></h3><p>After graduating from High School, Peter Parker enrolled at ESU ( <a href=\"/empire-state-university/34-43783/\">Empire State University</a>) where Flash introduced him to <a href=\"/harry-osborn/29-2478/\">Harry Osborn</a> and <a href=\"/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\">Gwen Stacy</a>. During this time, Aunt May suffered from a serious heart attack. Peter would constantly blow his friends off and they saw this as an insult. Eventually their relationship would get better as Peter became more involved with his peers. He and Harry became best friends and roommates. Peter also started dating Gwen Stacy. He would also meet <a href=\"../../anna-may-watson/29-33193/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anna Watson's</a> niece <a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Jane</a>. Although he was attracted to Mary Jane, Peter decided to settle with Gwen because MJ was too much of a \"party girl\" for him. Peter loves Gwen, but their relationship was strained a bit by him constantly leaving to fight crime. Their relationship was saved by Gwen's father, <a href=\"../../captain-george-stacy/29-2479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Police Captain George Stacy</a>, an ally of Spider-Man, who approved of Peter dating his daughter. Gwen's father was later killed during a battle between Spider-Man and Doc Ock, after he was crushed by falling debris while saving a child. In his dying breath, George called Spider-Man \"Peter\", revealing that he had always known about his dual identity and urged him to take care of Gwen. George's death caused a strain in the couple's relationship because Gwen blamed Spider-Man for her loss. She left Peter for some time to live with her uncle in <a href=\"../../london/34-55798/\" rel=\"nofollow\">London</a>.</p><h3>Arch-Nemesis: Green Goblin</h3><p>After suffering numerous defeats at the hands of Spider-Man, the Green Goblin vowed to destroy his foe once and for all. Using a special gas that blocks Peter's Spider-Sense, the Goblin followed Peter around and discovered his secret identity. Now knowing Peter was Spider-Man, the Green Goblin kidnapped him, and although he has the chance to kill Peter, the Goblin instead revealed his own secret identity. He was Norman Osborn, a ruthless businessman who was also Harry's father. Norman released Spider-Man from his restraints to defeat him in combat and prove his superiority. The Web-Slinger managed to defeat him and knocked him into some chemicals, resulting in Norman having amnesia and no recollection of both his and Peter's alternate egos.</p><p>Spider-Man also fought the <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rhino</a>, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shocker</a>, and the <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scorpion</a>. At one point, Peter felt that he was unable to carry the burden of being Spider-Man any longer and considered retiring from super-heroics. When the <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a> of Crime made his move to take over the city, Peter knew that it was still his responsibility to protect the innocent and so he defeated this crime-lord and returned to crime fighting.</p><h3><b>Death of Gwen Stacy and Aftermath</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1862540\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011_super.jpg\" title=\"One of Spider-Man's defining moments\"><img id=\"1862540\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1862540-life_doa_temp_clip_image011_medium.jpg\" alt=\"One of Spider-Man's defining moments\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">One of Spider-Man's defining moments</div></div></div></div><p>At the end of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a>, Norman Osborn's memories began to flood back. He decided to hurt Peter as much as possible as the Green Goblin. He kidnapped Gwen Stacy and held her hostage at the Brooklyn Bridge. Spider-Man went to save Gwen and, despite being ill at the time, managed to defeat the Goblin. The Goblin threw Gwen off the bridge and, although Peter caught her by attaching a web line to her leg as she fell, the drop caused her neck to snap. As Spider-Man held Gwen's dead body, he vowed to kill the Goblin. He tracked him down to one of his warehouses. He brutally pummeled the Goblin in a fit of rage but managed to stop himself from committing murder. In one last attempt to achieve victory, Norman sent his Goblin Glider to impale Spider-Man from behind. Peter ducks and the Goblin is apparently killed from being impaled by his own glider. Mary Jane consoled Peter on the death of Gwen and the two started to date. Peter eventually proposed to her, but she refused and ended up breaking up with him. At this time <a href=\"../../jackal/29-10974/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miles Warren</a>, a college professor obsessed with Gwen became the deranged villain known as the <a href=\"/jackal/29-10974/\">Jackal</a>. He hired the <a href=\"../../punisher/29-1525/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Punisher</a> to kill Spider-Man and he also made copies of both Gwen and Peter. The <a href=\"../../scarlet-spider/29-6286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter copy</a> escaped and <a href=\"../../gwen-stacy-clone/29-52936/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gwen's copy</a> eventually went back to Miles. Harry Osborn followed in the footsteps of his father and became the next Green Goblin. He blamed Peter for his father's death. Harry later lost his memory after a fight with Spider-Man. Harry's psychologist, <a href=\"../../bart-hamilton/29-34978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bart Hamilton</a> attempted to take up the mantle of the Goblin himself but was killed by his own bomb while fighting Peter.</p><h3><b>Secret Wars and the Symbiote</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1862547\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1862547-secret_wars_super.jpg\" title=\"Black Suit\"><img id=\"1862547\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1862547-secret_wars_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Black Suit\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Black Suit</div></div></div></div><p>The <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beyonder</a> transported Spider-Man along with other heroes and villains to <a href=\"../../battleworld/34-51065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Battleworld</a> to take place in the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Wars</a>, an intergalactic battle between the world\u2019s greatest heroes and villains. During the battle, Spider-Man\u2019s suit was badly damaged and he needed a new one. Peter came upon a strange machine that produced a <a href=\"/venom/29-1486/\">black substance</a> which slithered over him and covered his entire body. This new black and white costume, similar to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arachne/29-16197/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arachne's</a> costume, replaced his old costume. Once the heroes won the battle, they were all transported back to Earth and Spider-Man kept on wearing the suit because it enhanced his strength, speed, and agility. He would start experiencing odd signs of fatigue and became even more concerned when he discovered that the suit produced organic webbing. He took the suit to <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards</a> who told him that it's actually a <a href=\"/venom/29-1486/\">living alien symbiote</a>, which can only survive by bonding to a host and draining their life-force away. Reed used a sonic emitter to separate Peter from the suit. Spider-Man was now without a costume and <a href=\"/human-torch/29-2120/\">Johnny Storm</a>, as part of a practical joke, gave Peter an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for a mask and dubbed him the Bombastic Bag-Man. Admiring the black suit's design, Spidey's then-girlfriend and crime-fighting partner the <a href=\"/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a> made him a cloth version of the black costume which he would start using for a time. The symbiote made its way back to Peter and attempted to permanently bond with him, but Peter used the sounds of a church bell to seemingly destroy the suit. It survived and found a host in <a href=\"../../eddie-brock/29-6733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eddie Brock</a> to become one of Spider-Man's deadliest and most recurring foes, <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom</a>.</p><h3><b>Marriage</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2056897\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2056897-spideywedding_456.jpg\" title=\"Peter Weds Mary Jane\"><img id=\"2056897\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2056897-spideywedding_456_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Weds Mary Jane\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Peter Weds Mary Jane</div></div></div></div><p>Sometime later, Spider-Man revealed his identity to the Black Cat who would end up breaking up with him.

Meanwhile, the <a href=\"../../puma/29-15238/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puma</a> had tracked down Spider-Man but Peter sensed his presence using his spider-sense.</p><p>Fearing for MJ's safety, Peter pushes her out of the apartment so that he could fight the Puma as Spider-Man without revealing his identity to her. MJ heard the sounds of battle. After Peter defeated Puma, MJ confessed to him that she cannot handle the danger he puts himself in. She tells him that she has always known his secret identity. Black Cat appears to reconcile with Peter which caused MJ to run away crying. She considered leaving town again but she then decided to confront Peter. They became very close and they would tell each other everything. They were hiding from their true feelings and Peter proposed to MJ. Although she initially refused, after making amends with her sister, MJ returned to Peter and accepted his proposal. Despite knowing that they are still too young and Peter's double life may make things difficult, Peter and Mary Jane tied the knot.</p><h3><b>Kraven's Last Hunt</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2056896\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03.jpg\" title=\"Kraven's Last Hunt\"><img id=\"2056896\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2056896-sethjohnson_02_03_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Kraven's Last Hunt\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kraven's Last Hunt</div></div></div></div><p>Peter's life did not get any easier after his wedding. As soon as he returned from his honeymoon, he was attacked by <a href=\"../../kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kraven the Hunter</a> in one of the most traumatizing events in both Peter and MJ's lives. Kraven was seeking to regain the honor that his family had lost and to do so, he must prove his superiority over his greatest foe, Spider-Man. After ambushing him, Kraven shot Peter in the head with a rifle and buried him on his grounds. Kraven donned a black Spider-Man costume and became a merciless vigilante. He even defeated <a href=\"../../vermin/29-6818/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vermin</a>, a villain Spider-Man could not defeat on his own. After two weeks, it was revealed that Spider-Man was actually alive and Kraven shot him with a tranquilizer. Peter eventually made his way to Kraven's estate and brutally pummeled the hunter. Kraven was unconcerned as he has proven his superiority over his foe before and so he set the <a href=\"/vermin/29-6818/\">Vermin</a> free. After Spider-Man left Kraven to capture Vermin, Kraven killed himself.</p><h3><b>Death of Jean DeWolff</b></h3><p>A close friend of Peter's, <a href=\"../../jean-dewolff/29-2471/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean DeWolff</a> was killed by a criminal called the <a href=\"../../sin-eater/29-11206/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sin-Eater</a>. Spider-Man became determined to capture him before anyone else was hurt and so he teamed up with Daredevil, who also held a grudge against the criminal. After an encounter with Sin-Eater that left an innocent bystander harmed, Peter was drawn closer to the dark side. After saving Betty Brant from the criminal, Spider-Man was tempted to kill him but was stopped by <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a>.

When Eddie bonded with the symbiote and became <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom</a>, Eddie launched several attacks on Peter's life, even scaring MJ. Peter stopped wearing the black suit following MJ's request. Eddie's symbiote had an offspring which bonded with Cletus Kasady, a psychotic murderer, to become <a href=\"../../carnage/29-1490/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnage</a>. Venom and Spider-Man were forced to team-up to defeat this new foe. Some time later, Peter and Eddie formed a truce, promising never to interfere with each others lives ever again.</p><h3><b>Death of Harry Osborn</b></h3><p>Harry Osborn's memories of being the Green Goblin came flooding back and he attempted to ruin Peter's life one more time. Before destroying a building that contained Peter, MJ and his son <a href=\"../../normie-osborn/29-11552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Normie</a>, Harry regained his sanity and managed to save them. Immediately after doing so, he died from being poisoned by the <a href=\"../../goblin-formula/18-56623/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goblin Formula</a>.</p><h3><b>Maximum Carnage</b></h3><p>After Harry's death, Peter decided to retire from super-heroics. After Carnage formed a team of other psychopaths and went on a bloody rampage around New York, Spider-Man was forced to team-up with his old foe Venom again. The two of them, along with other heroes, managed to stop them.</p><h3><b>Peter's Parents</b></h3><p>Peter's parents suddenly appeared in his life, claiming to have been abducted by communists. He had learned to love his \"parents\" and even revealed to them his secret identity. They turned out to be robots invented by the Chameleon to infiltrate Peter's life, discover his connections to Spider-Man and then kill him. The robot that masqueraded as Peter's father Richard was perfectly willing to accomplish his task and kill Peter, but the Mary robot had learned to love Peter and saw him as good person. Richard turned into a vicious engine of destruction. Before Richard could finish Peter off, Mary killed him using an electric cable. In return she was killed by the Vulture who was conspiring with the Chameleon. An enraged Spider-Man completely pummeled the Vulture but was stopped by the cries of his dying \"mother\". She told Peter in her last moments that despite everything, she still loved him.

When his aunt May was believed to be dying, Ben returned to New York and eventually met Peter Parker. At first the two fought and Peter saw Ben as a thread, but later on the two of them worked together, with Ben even taken over as Spider-man for some time when it was believed that Peter had lost his powers. The story arc lasted for two years and ended with the death of Ben Reilly at the hands of a returning Norman Osborn who was revealed to be alive and has been pulling strings from the moment he was believed to have died.

Elsewhere, a criminal with no regard for human life known as <a href=\"/massacre/29-76320/\">Massacre</a> goes on a rampage and kills several people before Spider-Man appears to stop him. Lacking his Spider-Sense, Spider-Man is hit by one of Massacre's bullets and he realizes how much he depended on it. Massacre manages to escape and Spider-Man cannot track him down since the use of his Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete without his Spider-Sense. At Horizon Labs, Peter builds himself a special bulletproof armored costume that protects him from harm and equips himself with magnetic webbing that can be used to disable the radio frequencies of Massacre's handheld detonators. Later, Massacre holds hostages at a Wall Street building and attempts to set off another bomb to kill more people. Spider-Man appears, armed with the armor and magnetic webbing, prevents Massacre from killing anymore people and brutally beats the deranged villain into submission. After Massacre is defeated, the police arrive and under the orders of Mayor Jameson attempt to kill him but Spider-Man saves him by taking the bullets instead using his armor.

Later, Peter and Carlie Cooper are talking when Carlie reveals she has spider-powers. When news of several hundreds of New Yorkers having manifested spider-powers reaches them, Carlie web swings away to help. Peter then pretends to be another random spider-powered New Yorker and defends New York against the spider-powered villains, along with the Avengers. Anti-Venom is seen curing people of their spider-powers, as he showed the ability to do so in New Ways to Die. Jackal is seen working on the Spider-King, filled with tiny embryos. Horizon Labs and Mr Fantastic work on finding a cure while the Avengers keep Manhattan quarantined to stop the virus from spreading.

Reed Richards finally develops a vaccine that stops people from gaining spider-powers, but cannot cure those already infected. J. Jonah Jameson discovers that he, too, has gained spider powers. Anti-Venom continues curing people, however Madame Web faints from the massive excess of spiders accessing the 'web of life'. Carlie meets up with Spiderman, when they attempt to take down Shocker, who has grown 6 extra arms.

Peter, with his full power, defeats Tarantula and throws him into a pool of the serum. The serum cures Tarantula of his degeneration and even the Spider-Queen's mind control; the healthy Kaine offers to help Peter. Madame Web and Spider-Queen are both reconnected to the Web. Spider-Queen thus becomes a Spider-Goddess.</p><p>Spider-Queen has now evolved into a massive, spider-like monster, drawing strength from all infected New Yorkers. Mary Jane realizes that, because of her long relationship to Peter, she has some immunity against the disease, gaining spider-powers but not the subsequent mutations. Peter gives Kaine the Stealth Suit (immune to the Queen's sonic attacks) and Kaine goes to attack the Queen. Peter and Mary Jane gather several octobots, outfitting each with several doses of the cure, making them go out to cure people. Peter then connects with the antennae on top of the Empire State Building, curing many people at once, while Mary Jane fights off the spider-like creatures attacking them. Kaine jumps inside the Queen's mouth, killing her by reflecting her sonic scream on her insides. The Jackal uses a disguise to get samples of the Queen's bone marrow for future experiments.</p><p>The following day, Peter learns from Doctor Strange that the psychic blindspot put in place to defend his secret identity has been destroyed, because of a viral video of spider-powered Peter defending people.

He attempts to slow them down but instead gets beaten down by Colossus. When Magik tells Colossus to kill him and Colossus replies that they are turning into things they are not due to the power, Spider-Man takes advantage and manages to convince the Rasputins to attack each other. And as they do, they both are knocked unconscious and are depowered of their Phoenix Force powers.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Height:</b> 5'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 167 lbs. 11.93stones 75.75kg</li><li><b>Eye Color:</b> Hazel</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Brown</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li><b>Identity:</b> Secret</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Forest Hills, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Education:</b> College graduate (biophysics major), doctorate studies in biochemistry (incomplete)</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Freelance photographer, former assistant high school coach, former science teacher, scientific researcher</li><li><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"/richard-parker/29-15261/\">Richard Parker</a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"/mary-parker/29-15262/\">Mary Parker</a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"/uncle-ben/29-3114/\">Benjamin Parker</a> (uncle, deceased), <a href=\"/aunt-may/29-1780/\">May Parker</a> (aunt), Will Fitzpatrick (grandfather), <a href=\"/scarlet-spider/29-6286/\">Benjamin Reilly</a> (Scarlet Spider, clone, deceased), <a href=\"/kaine/29-8667/\">Kaine</a> (clone), <a href=\"/spidercide/29-25666/\">Spidercide</a> (clone).</li></ul><h2><b>Powers and Abilities</b></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2026841\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man\"><img id=\"2026841\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2026841-spidey_by_mike_d_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man</div></div></div></div><p>Spider-Man possesses the proportionate powers of a spider, granted to him from an irradiated Common House Spider (Achaearanea tepidariorum) which bit Peter Parker that was apparently already mutated from prior exposure to certain frequencies of radiation and received a final, lethal dose during Parker's attendance of the exhibition.</p><p>The radioactive, complex mutagenic enzymes in the spider's blood that were transferred at the time of the bite triggered numerous body-wide mutagenic changes within Parker, granting him superhuman strength, speed, toughened flesh, and numerous arachnid-like abilities. Like many superhuman powers, the effectiveness of Spider-Man's abilities varies based on the author and the needs of the story.</p><p><b>Spider-Sense</b></p><p>Spider-Man has many abilities but the most amazing of all is his uncanny Spider-Sense. It is a tingling sensation on the back of his skull that acts as a \"sixth sense\" and it manifests when he is around or targeted by incoming dangers. It's a precognition ability that is pheromone based and is similar to Daredevil's radar sense, increasing his reaction time and awareness. The spider-sense can manifest when Peter's secret identity is about to be compromised. It also manifests when he encounters someone who might pose a threat to him or to someone he cares about. For example, when Peter saw his roommate <a href=\"/michele-gonzales/29-62208/\">Michele Gonzales</a> with one of her clients, his spider-sense warned him that the client was actually a thug who was participating in a super-villain gladiatorial contest. While the spider-sense cannot discern the specific nature of the impending threat, he can identify which direction it is coming from and the severity of the danger by the intensity of the spider-sense. Sometimes it becomes strong enough to be painful. When Spider-Man is blinded, the Spider-Sense works as another set of eyes to avoid bumping into objects. When <a href=\"/daken/29-42501/\">Daken</a> used his pheromones on Spider-Man, Peter closed his eyes and relied only on his spider-sense to defeat his foe because the pheromones corrupted his sight. A similar situation happened when Peter fought the new Vulture who blinded him with acid in the eyes. Spider-Man relied on this ability to survive this fight. Of course his Spider-Sense is a great help when he faces people in the dark. This has been proven in his fight with <a href=\"/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a>. The spider-sense can lose its effectiveness when Peter is too distracted, tired or when he chooses to ignore it although its difficult to do so because it is heavily linked to his reflexes. There are also times that his spider-sense cannot be very effective due to the fact that Spidey's lack of skills and proper training, make him unfocused while he is fighting. That affects the way that his spider-sense is being used. Under extreme circumstances, while fighting in the dark or against powerful characters, Spidey tries to use his spectacular spider-sense in a more effective and better way. The Spider-Sense gives him his own free-style of combat, allowing him to go head-to-head with the best martial artists in the Marvel Universe. Also, the Spider-Sense allows Spider-Man to detect certain radio frequencies on which his spider tracers' signals are based upon. During Spider-Man's first encounter with the Chameleon, the villain used a certain radio frequency to send a message to Spider-Man via his spider-sense. The Spider-Sense, combined with his agility and reflexes allows Spider-Man to dodge just about any attack, even speeding bullets. Due to the similar nature of their powers, Spider-Man is unable to sense other \"Spyders\", such as Ben Reilly, Ezekiel, and Kaine. During the Big Time story, Spider-Man used a device to block Alistair Smythe's minions' enhanced senses but also disabled his own Spider-Sense. After the events of Spider-Island, Peter regained this ability.</p><h4><b>Super Strength</b></h4><p>Spider-Man has the proportionate strength of a spider, thus allowing him to press lift well over 10 tons and even much more when under stress. His attacks are so strong; they could kill a normal person. Spidey has to pull his punches or kicks when not fighting foes with similar or higher strength level to avoid fatalities. His strength also extends to his feet, allowing him to leap great lengths and attain a height of three stories with one powerful jump. His strength also gives him incredible durability as his body is much tougher than that of a normal person. He can withstand damage and punishment that would most likely kill non-super powered individuals. Spidey's strength has made him capable of going toe-to-toe with stronger opponents including <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Doctor Octopus</a>, <a href=\"/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a> and <a href=\"/rhino/29-2126/\">Rhino</a>. He has even held his own against powerful heroes such as Iron Man and the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>. Spidey's strength and durability also give him incredible stamina allowing him to exert himself beyond the limits of ordinary men as his body produces less fatigue toxins. After his encounter with the Queen, Spider-Man's strength had been increased to the point where he has become able to lift over 15 tons and after the Other story arc he had become able to lift at least 20 tons. He wore an Iron Spider costume designed for him by Tony Stark which increased his strength further allowing him to lift well over 25 tons. He has stopped wearing the Iron Spider costume after the Civil War and his enhanced strength was erased by <a href=\"/mephisto/29-2635/\">Mephisto</a> after the One More Day storyline.</p><h4><b>Super Speed</b></h4><p>Spider-Man possesses the uncanny speed, agility and reflexes of a spider. He can move at a speed that surpasses that of the finest human athletes. He can easily catch up with speeding cars on foot. Spider-Man can easily perform the most complicated acrobatic moves as his body is extremely flexible, giving him agility, balance and bodily coordination that surpass those of the finest human athletes. Spider-Man is considered the best when it comes to balance in the Marvel Universe, as he possesses excellent equilibrium allowing him to balance himself on any object. Even the most agile heroes like Captain America, Daredevil and <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> are nowhere near Spider-Man's level of speed and agility. Spider-Man's reflexes are almost forty times greater than those of the finest athletes, enabling him to dodge bullets at point blank range, or even sometimes after they are fired by instincts only without his Spider-Sense.</p><h4><b>Wall Crawling</b></h4><p>Spider-Man's exposure to the mutated spider venom induced a mutagenic, cerebellum-wide alteration of his engrams resulting in the ability to mentally control the flux of inter-atomic attraction (electrostatic force) between molecular boundary layers. This overcomes the outer electron shell's normal behavior of mutual repulsion with other outer electron shells and permits the tremendous potential for electron attraction to prevail. The mentally controlled sub-atomic particle responsible for this has yet to be identified. This ability to affect the attraction between surfaces is so far limited to Spider-Man's body (especially concentrated in his hands and feet) and another object, with an upper limit of several tons per finger. Limits to this ability seem to be psychosomatic, and the full nature of this ability has yet to be established.</p><h4><b>Organic Webbing</b></h4><p>There are different areas in different comic book universes where Spider-Man has organic webbing. Spider Man has organic webbing from the movies (of course), 616 (end of civil war, back in black, etc.). Spider Man also always has organic webbing in the 2099 universe.</p><h4><b>Super Stamina</b></h4><p>Spider-Man's advanced musculature produces less fatigue toxins during physical activity than an ordinary human. This allows him to exert himself physically for much longer periods of time before fatigue begins to impair him. At his peak, Spider-Man can physically exert himself at his peak capacity for several hours before the build up of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. Several accounts depict Spider-Man as able to hold his breath for eight minutes or more.</p><h4><b>Regenerative Healing Factor</b></h4><p>Spider-Man has a limited healing factor. While not on Wolverine's level, it is sufficiently powerful enough to recover from severe injuries from broken bones and large amounts of tissue damage in a matter of days. After getting his powers, he soon found that his eyesight was repaired, discarding his glasses. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind, however after about 2 days his sight was perfect, albeit sensitive for about a day after.</p><h4><b>Foreign Chemical Resistance</b></h4><p>Due to his accelerated metabolism, Spider-Man has a higher tolerance for drugs and diseases than normal humans, and he can recover from the effects of larger doses rapidly. During an encounter with the Swarm, Spider-Man was incapacitated by thousands of bee stings, but recovered in less than 24 hours. His resistance and recovery time to other toxins and diseases varies, but is typically significantly higher than normal. Spider-Man's unique physiology even allowed him to recover from the effects of vampirism. Spider-Man was able to recover completely from acid being spat into his eyes by the new Vulture; Jimmy Natale, although the extent of the damage may have been restricted due to his superhuman durability. However, Spider-Man has the normal human tolerance for alcoholic beverages.</p><h4><b>Skills</b></h4><p>On top of his spider-given powers Peter is of gifted-level intelligence. It has even been stated that Peter scored as high on some of the same testing scores as <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> did when he was Peter's age. He is especially gifted in the sciences such as mechanics, biology and physics. He has built many devices in his career as Spider-Man and is a skilled photographer and teacher. He has developed a unique style of combat through the years. Spider-Man, while not having been trained, has gone toe to toe with even the best marvel fighters. His spider-sense alone is like a close combat expert provided with Spider-Man's reflexes and split second quickness.</p><p>Upon approaching the Spider-Island arc, Peter has felt vulnerable with the lack of his spider sense. He begins training under Shang Chi to create his own unique martial arts style to make up for his lack of spider sense called \"Way of the Spider\". It is then revealed that Shang Chi was instructed by the new Madam Web (Julia Carpenter the former Arachne and Spider-Woman) to secretly prepare Peter for a future threat (Spider-Island). This style consists hitting pressure points with Spider Strength, and striking with Spider Speed.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><h4><b>Web-Shooters</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1104255\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1104255\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23732/1104255-440px_webshooters_main_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Perhaps, Spider-Man's most famous piece of equipment is his self built <a href=\"/web-shooters/18-42426/\">web-shooters</a> which allow him to shoot sticky ropes of webbing which he uses to swing from building to building. They are a pair of special wrist devices of Peter's own design that contain a material that mixes with air to web-like material. They can be used in many different ways by varying the pressure and adjusting the nozzles of the spinnerets. They can take the form of strong thin lines, as fine quick spreading lines, or as a thick adhesive liquid. Spider-Man can either use the webbing as web-gloves to protect his hands, as a Web-Parachute, an air-proof Web-Dome, a Web-Shield that offers protection from bullets and energy blasts, as small \"web-bullets\" that bounce off opponents, use the webbing to ensnare an opponent, tie foes up with a rope and hang them upside down from vertical poles, pulling his foes towards him, or shoot them in any direction he chooses Spider-Man's primary means of transportation is by the use of his webbing to swing around the city. He shoots a strand of webbing to a high location, like the edge of a building, and pushes his body towards any direction he chooses while holding on to the web, allowing him to traverse at an accelerated speed. This artificial webbing lasts for an hour before fading away. More recently he has evolved biological web shooters that spray webbing from his forearms but this power has been erased by Mephisto after the One More Day storyline.</p><h4><b>Utility Belt</b></h4><p>Spider-Man wears a belt under his costume that contains a built-in <a href=\"../../spider-signal/18-56597/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Signal</a>. He uses it as either an unconventional light source or as a way to intimidate lesser villains. The belt also contains spare web cartridges, tracers, the camera and his mask when not in costume.</p><h4><b>Camera</b></h4><p>Spider-Man possesses his father's automatic camera which zones in on the spider symbol on Spider-Man's chest. It takes photos whenever movement is made in front of it. He would place the camera in a certain spot and springs into action in front of it, allowing him to take photos of himself. As Spider-Man he uses the camera to capture his heroic exploits to then sell the photos to the <a href=\"../../daily-bugle/65-40822/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daily Bugle</a>.</p><h4><b>Spider-Tracer</b></h4><p>The <a href=\"../../spider-tracer/18-55656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Tracer</a> is a typical tracker that is shaped liked a spider and is aerodynamic for flight. The tracers are very small so it will not be noticed when attached to a person. The tracers contain a special radio frequency that his Spider-Sense can detect. He usually uses the tracers to track objects or people via his Spider-Sense within a 100 mile radius. Spider-Man fires the tracers at high velocity using his web-shooters and he has them coated with webbing in order for them to be firmly attached to their target. Since Peter lost his Spider-Sense, the use of the Spider-Tracers is rendered obsolete since he can only track them using his enhanced senses.</p><h4><b>Mask</b></h4><p>The white areas in Spider-Mans eye cut-outs on his mask are really clever plastic lenses of the two-way mirror type. He can see out very clearly, but no one can see in. Therefore, he can never be recognized by the color of his eyes. These ingenious plastic lenses also protect his eyes from dust, dirt, and the glare of the sun. Spider-Man's colorful head-mask conceals his facial features and expressions and also effectively muffles his voice, making it unrecognizable. When using the Iron Spider-Man suit, it changed his voice in many ways. When Spider-Man became an Avenger, a special comm-link was outfitted into his mask allowing him to communicate with his fellow Avengers as well as others.</p><h4><b>Spider-Mobile</b></h4><p>The <a href=\"/spider-mobile/18-15441/\">Spider-Mobile</a> would first appear in The Amazing Spider-Man #130 in 1974. Spider-Man would be approached by Corona Motors who offers him a non-polluting vehicle in which they wanted him to promote. However, Peter turned it down and approaches his friend <a href=\"/human-torch/29-2120/\">Johnny Storm</a> to create their own vehicle. They customized a dune buggy to have web-launchers and a spider-signal. It could also be disguised as a regular car so that no one would suspect that he was Spider-Man. Spider-Man would put it into action but it is quickly wrecked because <a href=\"/mysterio/29-4333/\">Mysterio</a> tricked Peter into driving it off a pier. Later the Tinkerer would be able to recover the wrecked dune buggy and re-modify it to be able to drive up walls and to drive itself. The <a href=\"/tinkerer/29-3144/\">Tinkerer</a> sent it to fight Spider-Man, in which he would barely defeat his own car.</p><h2><b>Costumes</b></h2><p>Spider-Man has changed his costume many times but would always return to his classic and most well known look which has varied sometimes. He has had many memorable costumes, including the Black &amp; White symbiote suite, the Red &amp; Gold Iron Spider suit, the Identity Crisis costumes, the Scarlet Spider costume, the White &amp; Blue Armored Spider suit, the Bag-Man costume and recently he has started wearing a black &amp; green costume. You can view several of Spider-Man's costumes in his costume gallery.</p><p>It is Spider-Man's original and main look that has defined Spider-Man since his first appearance. Although it has seen many variations, it has remained one of Spider-Man's essential traits. During Spidey's early appearances, the costume was black &amp; red with blue shadings. In later issues, the colors change and they become red &amp; blue with black shading but some artists use the black color to give the character more depth. Also, Spider-Man was portrayed having webbing underneath his armpits that extended from his wrist to his waist. Over time, the under-arm webbing has shrank and some artists decided to draw Spidey without the webbing although it still appeared in some modern appearances.</p><h3><b>Black Suit</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"100577\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man.jpg\" title=\"Black Suit\"><img id=\"100577\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/100577-26929-spider-man_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Black Suit\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Black Suit</div></div></div></div><p>Spider-Man discovered the symbiote costume during the <a href=\"/secret-wars/39-40978/\">Secret Wars</a> and it became his primary costume until he discovered that it was an alien feeding on him. With it he was considerably stronger, more durable, and vastly more aggressive. However, the aggressive nature of the suit eventually began to alter him personally and made him hurt many of his friends. His powers were enhanced by the alien but despite its benefits, he decided it must be destroyed and would later get rid of it using the sounds of a church bell. It would later bond with Eddie Brock to form the deadly villain known as Venom. The Black Cat would later give Spidey a cloth version of the black suit which he would start wearing for a time, switching between it and the red &amp; blue costume. After the <a href=\"/kravens-last-hunt/39-43327/\">Kraven's last Hunt</a> story and the appearance of Venom for the first time, Mary Jane urged Peter to stop wearing the costume because it reminded her of those traumatizing events. During the Back In Black story, after Aunt May was shot by a sniper, a darkness filled Spider-Man's heart like never before and he wore the black costume to show this dark side and he became more ruthless towards enemies. Peter attempted to infiltrate Stark Tower to stop Norman Osborn, he used a black costume made of unstable molecules to disguise himself as the Venom. During the Grim Hunt story, after Kraven was recovered, he presented Peter with a black costume as a calling card after the Kravinoffs killed Peter's \"brother\" Kane. He once again wore this costume and became aggressive towards the villains, vowing to hunt them all down. He was about to kill Kraven with a spear until he was convinced otherwise by Arachne and <a href=\"/spider-girl/29-40598/\">Arana</a>. The black suit represents Spider-Man's dark side.</p><h3><b>Iron Spider suit</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"230136\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man.jpg\" title=\"Iron Spider\"><img id=\"230136\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/230136-47260-spider-man_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Iron Spider\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Iron Spider</div></div></div></div><p>After the \" <a href=\"/spider-man-the-other/39-43776/\">Other</a>\" story arc, Tony Stark designed for Peter a specialized Red &amp; Gold costume that is similar to Tony Stark's Iron Man costume. It was designated as Spider-Man Armored Fighting suit Version 1.1 which was made of a liquid nano-fiber. It provided Peter with the added functions of a short-ranged gliding function, increased strength, heat-resistant Kevlar microfiber that provided resistance to small caliber bullets, built-in fire, police and emergency scanners, visual amplifications such as infrared and ultraviolet, carbon filter in the mouth to prevent inhalation of airborne toxins, and a short-range GPS microwave communication system. All of which are controlled in the computerized control system in the titanium chest piece in the costume. Another very useful addition was a stealth mode which allowed Spider-Man to blend with the environment or even disappear completely in some backgrounds. Along with this came the customization option to instantly switch between any former style he's worn (Spidey suit, black suit, normal clothes, etc); all on the same suit. It also contained three retractable spider legs called \"waldoes\" which can be used as offensive weapons. Spidey wore this costume before and during the Civil War but Tony, in order to keep an eye on Peter, had the costume feed him with information about Peter, notably the Spider-Sense. When Peter revealed that he was going to switch sides and fought Iron Man, the latter used a voice activated override which incapacitated Peter for a while. He had already known about this and used his computer expertise to disable the override and managed to defeat Iron Man with a surprise attack. He then discarded the costume and returned to wear his original costume when he joined Captain America's team during the Civil War. The members of the initiative team known as the <a href=\"../../scarlet-spiders/65-44648/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Spiders</a> would start wearing costumes of similar design and functions.</p><h3><b>Spider Armor</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2285272\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285272-spider_armor.gif\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2285272\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285272-spider_armor_thumb.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>While in an ESU laboratory, Peter invented a white &amp; blue suit that was made of steel plates that were from a pseudo-metallic composition using a modified webbing formula. He used this costume during the \"My enemy's enemy\" story where he fought Blood Rose, Gauntlet and the heavily armed New Enforcers. The costume was destroyed by acid during the battle and was never rebuilt. Despite providing Spider-Man with increased durability and strength, it slowed down his movements.</p><h3><b>Insulated Costume</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2285278\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285278-costumespiderpadded425.gif\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2285278\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285278-costumespiderpadded425_thumb.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>When fighting Electro, Spidey had to modify his costume to defeat his foe. He once made a costume from a rubber air mattress that made victory over Electro possible. On another occasion, when Electro's powers were amplified, Spider-Man used an improved version of the insulated costume that was resistant to Electro's attacks. With the help of <a href=\"/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a>, Spider-Man once again defeated Electro.</p><h3><b>Bombastic Bag-Man costume</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2285282\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285282-bombasticbagman_.gif\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2285282\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285282-bombasticbagman__medium.gif\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>After Peter was separated from the symbiote by Mr. Fantastic, he was left without a costume and as part of a practical joke; the Human Torch gave him an old Fantastic Four costume with a paper bag for his head, dubbing him the Bombastic Bag-Man. When he was accused of murder, Spidey would use this moniker on another occasion to prevent others from identifying him but this time he only wore a Paper-Bag mask while only wearing orange pants.</p><h3><b>Green Goblin costume</b></h3><p>During the <a href=\"../../the-goblin-heir/39-56290/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goblin Heir</a> story, in an attempt to have Peter become his heir, Norman Osborn brainwashes Peter into going on a rampage wearing a Green Goblin costume. Peter would burn down the Stacy's house and attack his friend but was totally unaware of these activities.</p><h3><b>Scarlet Spider costume</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2285295\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285295-scarlet_spider.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2285295\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285295-scarlet_spider_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>When Ben Reilly appeared in Peter's life, he donned a new costume and dubbed himself the Scarlet Spider. He wore a blue hooded sweatshirt with a large spider symbol over a red Spider-Man costume with the web-shooters shown on the outside. Peter wore it shortly, when Ben took his place in prison.</p><h3><b>Stealth Costume</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2285298\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285298-spidey06.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2285298\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285298-spidey06_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>During the <a href=\"/big-time/39-56278/\">Big Time</a> storyline, in an attempt to defeat the new and improved Hobgoblin, Peter creates a stealth suit. He is able to do this through his new job at Horizon Labs. The Stealth Suit warps light and sound to become invisible and totally silent, it is also impervious to sonic attacks. He also created special lenses so that he can be seen by people if needs be. The lighting on the suit can change between green, orange and blue. Orange is for the secondary mode which disrupts sonic frequencies from infrasonic to ultrasonic but is visible. Blue is it in normal mode which can be seen and heard. However, a side effect of this costume is that while he can be impervious to sonic attacks, it also prevents him from hearing others. For example, while fighting the Hobgoblin and the Kingpin, Spider-Man was unable to hear the Cat's cries for help.</p><h3><b>Future Foundation Costume</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2285302\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2285302\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/69848/2285302-1664129_1662244_djurdjevic___ff_spiderman_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>When Peter joined The Future Foundation he was given a new costume by <a href=\"/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Sue Storm</a>.

It was a look at the classic Spider-Man suit, red &amp; blue, however with a modern twist. The Spider suit had web shooters built into the wrist bands/arms, and also featured a cape for mobility. This was used when Peter Parker's counterpart was badly wounded and needed Peter, Amazing Spider-Man, to fight crime in New York for a short time while Peter, the Amazing Spider, healed up.

This version of the Spider-Man series debuted on ABC September 9, 1967 and lasted up until June 14, 1970. This story is about Peter Parker, a science student at a New York City university while witnessing a radiology experiment would be bitten on his hand by a radioactive spider. He then starts to find that he has amazing powers. He realizes that he has the spider's leaping, wall-crawling, spider sense, increased endurance, and super strength. He made himself a red and blue outfit and mask and produces a web-spinning fluid enabling him to swing from the buildings above the streets of Manhattan. Peter's first enemy would be the person who had killed his Uncle Ben. Uncle Ben would be killed by a burglar, a criminal that had ran past Peter earlier at the television studio. Peter didn't really care at the time and didn't help the police. This lead to Uncle Ben's death. Angry and upset, Peter sought his Uncle's murderer and webs him. After this tragedy, Peter would become a costumed crime fighter protecting New York. Peter Parker would be voiced by Bernard Cowan, Spider-Man would be voiced by Paul Soles, Len Carlson voiced Captain Stacy, Peg Dixon voiced Betty Brant, and Paul Kligman voiced J. Jonah Jameson. This series would also be well known for its theme song. It was performed by a vocal group with lyrics written by Paul Francis Webster and quick-tempo instrumentals performed by Bob Harris, published by Buddah Music, Inc. Lyrics \"Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Does whatever a spider can. Spins a web, any size. Catches thieves- just like flies. Look out! Here comes the Spider-Man! Is he strong? Listen, bud. He's got radioactive blood. Can he swing, from a thread? Take a look overhead. Hey, there! There goes the Spider-Man! In the chill of night, at the scene of a crime. Like a streak of light, he arrives just in time! Spider-Man. Spider-Man. Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. Wealth and fame? He's ignored. Action is his reward. To him, life is a great big bang-up. Wherever there's a hang-up, you'll find the Spider-Man!\"</p><h4><b>Spider-Man (1978)</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2164020\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/113934/2164020-original.jpg\" title=\"Japanese Spider-Man\"><img id=\"2164020\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/113934/2164020-original_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Japanese Spider-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Japanese Spider-Man</div></div></div></div><p>The Toei Company had made a television series based on Marvel's famous hero as a tokusatsu in <a href=\"../../japan/34-55746/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japan</a>.

When his father was killed exploring the ship, Takuya meets the lone survivor from Spider. It gives him a bracelet that not only grants him the same costume and the same powers as the American version but it also allows him to summon a giant robot (which looks an awful lot like a Power Ranger zord) to fight the evil of Professor Monster and his monstrous minions.

This was the second animated production of Spider-Man after its original series that started in 1967. This series was produced by the newly formed Marvel Productions, having risen from the ashes of DePatie-Freleng Enterprises. The company that had produced the 1978 New Fantastic Four and 1979 Spider-Woman animated series. This version's character design would be later used for the series Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series and would have some of the same people play as the same characters. The character designs for the series were based on the classic style of Spider-Man artist <a href=\"../../john-romita/26-7499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Romita</a> and were very similar to the visual look of the comics from the mid 60s to the early 80s. This series tells the life of Peter Parker a college student who lives a life as Peter and Spider-Man. They also used the same characters as before, such as: Peter's Aunt May, J. Jonah Jameson: Editor of the Daily Bugle, Betty Brant: Jameson's secretary and classic damsel in distress, and later on during the series, <a href=\"../../robbie-robertson/29-1782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robbie Robertson</a>, Jameson's assistant. Spidey also faces some of his usual foes such as: Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio and the Chameleon. This also included a six part story arc where Spidey goes up against Doctor Doom throughout the series. Spidey was voiced by Ted Schwartz in this series.</p><h4><b>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends (1981)</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2533828\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/93189/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2533828\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/93189/2533828-spider_man_and_his_amazing_friends_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends series debuted on NBC on September 12, 1981 and lasted through September 10, 1983.This would be the third animated adventure for Spidey which would end up being more popular than its previous series Spider-Man, which ended the same year this new show would start. After Spider-Man in 1981, NBC wanted to take Spider-Man on a different route which would appeal to more audiences. In this series, Marvel adds <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men's</a> Iceman and adds a new superhero named <a href=\"../../firestar/29-2101/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>. She gave Peter Parker a room that turned into a secret superhero hi-tech headquarters. This would change the title of the show to Spider-Man And His Amazing Friends. This series would added new villains only for this show and also have superhero team-ups throughout the series. They would fight some old enemies such as: Doctor Octopus, <a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scorpion</a>, Green Goblin, Kraven the Hunter, <a href=\"../../swarm/29-1945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swarm</a>, Chameleon, Electro, Mysterio, the Kingpin of Crime, <a href=\"../../shocker/29-4825/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shocker</a>, <a href=\"../../sandman/29-3544/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sandman</a>, <a href=\"../../beetle/29-4836/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beetle</a>, and other Marvel enemies such as: Doctor Doom, Magneto, <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loki</a>, <a href=\"../../mordred/29-19961/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordred</a>, the Red Skull, and the <a href=\"../../juggernaut/29-1445/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juggernaut</a>.

The cartoon revolved around a 19 year old Peter Parker (voiced by Christopher Daniel Barnes) in his first year at Empire State University. The story begins with Peter already having his Spider powers and is a part-time photographer for the Daily Bugle. Spider-Man would battle many classic villains and newer villains such as Green Goblin (Norman and Harry Osborn), Hobgoblin, the Chameleon, the Lizard, the Scorpion, Doctor Octopus, Mysterio, Rhino, the Kingpin of Crime, the Shocker, Vulture, Venom, and Carnage. Peter would eventually get into a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy/Black Cat, and eventually fall for Mary Jane Watson. Although Gwen Stacy was never in the series, Marvel gave us a little teaser in the series finale story arc, having Spider-Man go to an alternate universe and meeting Gwen Stacy herself. A very important story arc in this series began as the finale of Season 3 in the episode entitled \"Turning Point.\" In which the Green Goblin kidnaps Mary Jane and throws her off the George Washington Bridge, similar to the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died.\" However, with the heavy censorship in the 1990s not allowing television to have heavy violence, death being a part of it. Marvel decided to have Mary Jane and the Green Goblin fall into an inter-dimension vortex instead. Season 4 was mostly about the guilt that Spider-Man has to carry for losing Mary Jane. He tries to rebound with the Black Cat, but Mary Jane eventually mysteriously returns to life. Season 5 starts off with the much anticipated Wedding of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson-Parker. With season 5 being the last season, Marvel dropped a bomb on us by revealing that Mary Jane was actually a clone created by Dr. Miles Warren.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"179794\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\"><img id=\"179794\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6857/179794-4104-spider-man_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man: The Animated Series\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man: The Animated Series</div></div></div></div><p>To make matters worst, the Mary Jane clone was water based and was made for <a href=\"../../hydro-man/29-4457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hydro-Man</a>. Next, Marvel did a tribute to the Secret Wars. <a href=\"../../madame-web/29-10670/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Webb</a> was going to help Spider-Man find the real Mary Jane, who was still alive somewhere. As Spider-Man continued his search for Mary Jane, Madame Web and the Beyonder set up a chain of events where Spider-Man faced different versions of himself from different universes. One was him, where he is a rich multi-millionaire, and wears a metallic Spider-Suit, and has publicly made his identity known to the world. This version was made to mirror Marvel's popular super hero multi-billionaire, Tony Stark, a.k.a. Iron Man. Spider-Man in another reality he went to, found out he was married to a woman he never met in his life, Gwen Stacey. Gwen had never appeared in the series until now. Gwen revealed information of another Parker alternate reality. This one was strongly grieving of the death of Aunt May, he cut his hair, died it blonde, and went out as Spider-Man. However, he met a foe he could not beat, the Carnage symbiote. The symbiote felt the pain of Ben Reilly as he changed his name to negate any Parker ties. The symbiote and Reilly bond to become Spider-Carnage. All of the different Spider-Man realities, including the real Spider-Man, battled Spider- Carnage. They could not defeat him however. When he sees Gwen Stacey, his love of killing is put on hold, since he has romantic feelings for Gwen he has never gotten over. He thus realized what he had become, and committed suicide. After all was said and done, one Spider-Man had to take him with him to his reality. This one is our world. He is astounded at the fact of being an international symbol in our world, and before he leaves, he meets with the man who created him, Stan Lee.</p><h4><b>Spider-Man Unlimited (1999)</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1659100\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\"><img id=\"1659100\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23287/1659100-1586365_spiderman_unlimited_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man Unlimited\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man Unlimited</div></div></div></div><p>This series debuted on Fox October 2, 1999 and lasted through March 31, 2001. Spider-Man, in this series, was voiced by Rino Romano (making him the only voice actor to play both Spider-Man and Batman, the most-recognized characters from both DC and Marvel). This animated series was supposed to be the continuation of Spider-Man: The Animated Series show from 1994. This series would also take part in the future. The series starts off at the Polaris One site where JJJ's son, <a href=\"/john-jameson/29-4456/\">John Jameson</a> is talking to the public. About 6 months ago, through an advanced space warp drive engine, the man made probe called Alita projected itself to the far side of the sun where Alita recorded an exact duplicate of Earth. An Earth-like planet in the same orbit on the other side of the sun. John continues to talk about the probe being destroyed. Since then, people question should there be a man-made mission to go to \" <a href=\"/counter-earth/34-54572/\">Counter Earth</a>\". He goes on to say that there should be one to find out what was responsible for this and there should be an investigation. Peter then leaves to change into costume because his spider-sense is tingling. He sees Venom and Carnage and confronts them. The spaceship is readying for take off and Spidey battles Venom and Carnage while wondering what they are doing and why were they trying to stow away on the spaceship. Venom restrains Spidey and Carnage tells him that nothing will get in the way of them going to \"Counter Earth\" and joining the Synoptic. Spider-Man gets kicked off the flight and gets blamed for what happens to John during his mission. Six months later, they launch the Solaris II rescue mission to go to \"Counter Earth\". The Webslinger appears with his new suit featuring nano technology \"borrowed\" from the lab of Reed Richards. Microscopic robots cover his entire body with anti-symbiote devices. He is stopped by <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick Fury</a> who gives Spidey a chance to redeem himself by taking the space shuttle to \"Counter Earth\", so he can go rescue John Jameson.

The first movie of the re-boot is called The Amazing Spider-Man and stars relatively unknown British actor Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man. The Amazing Spider-Man was directed by Mark Webb and saw a slight re-imagining of Spider-Man's origin.

The game involves climbing a sky scraper, rescuing hostages and defusing bombs set by the Green Goblin. The 1990's saw a flood of Spider-Man Video Games. The first game of the decade released was <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b>, a puzzle action game released for Amiga, PC:DOS, Commodore 64, and Atari ST. Another game, also titled <b>The Amazing Spider-Man</b> was released in 1990 for the Game Boy. The Game Boy titles spawned two sequels: <b>The Amazing Spider-Man 2</b> and <b>The Amazing Spider-Man 3: Invasion of the Spider-Slayers</b>.</p><p>In 1991, Sega released the first Spider-Man arcade game titled <b>Spider-Man: The Video Game</b>. Sega also released The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin the same year. The Nintendo home consoles were late to the Spider-Man party, but they saw many Spider-Man titles themselves. The first was <b>Spider-Man: Return of the Sinister Six</b>, released in 1992 and considered by some to be one of the worst Spider-Man games of all time. Not all Spider-Man titles followed original story lines. In 1994, Spider-Man and Venom: Maximum Carnage was released for the Super Nintendo and the Sega Genesis. The game closely followed the <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage</a> Story Arc. 1995 gave us <b>Spider-Man and Venom: Separation Anxiety</b>, which was released on the Sega Genesis, the Super Nintendo and the PC. That same year, <b>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</b> was released for the Genesis and the Super Nintendo; it followed the storyline of the series, with most of the characters being represented the way they were in the cartoon. The next Spider-Man game, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Fire</b>, was released for the Sega 32X. This game is one of rarest and most valuable Spider-Man games to date. For the next couple of years, no game completely dedicated to Spider-Man was released. He did however star in <b>Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems</b> and the Marvel vs Capcom series.</p><p>Not until 2000 would Spider-Man return in his own game. Spider-Man made his triumphant video game return in 2000, with not one, but two games, and a special guest appearance that year. <b>Spider-Man</b> for the Game Boy Color was published by Activision and met with moderate success. Later that year <b>\"Spider-Man\"</b>, developed by NeverSoft, for the PlayStation was released. The game was met with critical and commercial success. The game was ported over to the Nintendo 64 the following year, but lacked the full motion cut scenes due the systems hardware. In September of that year, Spider-Man made a special appearance in <b>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2</b> as a hidden character. In 2001, sequels to the successful Activision titles were released. <b>\"Spider-Man 2: Enter Electro\"</b> for the PlayStation and <b>\"Spider-Man 2: Sinister Six\"</b> for the Gameboy Color. Spider-Man made an early appearance on Nintendo's new handheld system, The Gameboy Advance with <b>Spider-Man: Mysterio's Menace</b>. With the release of the Spider-Man films, the Spider-Man video games followed suit. <b>Spider-Man: The Game</b> was released in unison with the film in 2002. It was released on the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, the Gameboy Advance, the Xbox and the PC. The game broke many sales records at the time. When <a href=\"../../spider-man-2/223-42/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man 2</a> was released in June 2004, Spider-Man 2: The Game was released the day before. The game saw release on the same consoles as Spider-Man: The Game did, in addition to the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP. 2005 saw a comic related Spider-Man game hit the market; <b>\"Ultimate Spider-Man\"</b> followed many of the comic story arcs, and allowed the player to switch between Spider-Man and Venom. Spider-Man, voiced by Quinton Flynn, appears as one of the main characters in Ultimate Alliance and he has special conversations with Mysterio, Lizard and Scorpion, and Dark Spider-Man. His simulator disk has him saving <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> from the Scorpion and <a href=\"../../aim/65-13497/\" rel=\"nofollow\">A.I.M</a> in the Omega Base. His costumes are his classic, symbiote, Scarlet Spider and Stark Armor costumes. Spider-Man's latest film, <a href=\"../../spider-man-3/223-54/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man 3</a> also saw the same video game treatment as its prequels. <b>Spider-Man 3</b> was released on more consoles than any game before it. The game was available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 and 3, Nintendo Wii , Gameboy Advance, Nintendo DS, the Sony PSP and PC. Spider-Man: Friend or Foe was released in October 2007 for Xbox 360, Wii, Playstation 2 , PC, PSP and Nintendo DS. This Spider-Man game features the villains from the Spider-Man films, but with a humorous twist.</p><p>In 2008, <b>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</b> was released. It contained an original storyline not related to the movies, in which players switch between Spidey's Black costume and his classic Red &amp; Blue attire. Player's can dictate Spider-Man's actions, as he can be Heroic or Villainous, as related to his dependence on the symbiote. Many characters appear including Venom, Kingpin, Wolverine, <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a>, Mary Jane and others. It also has 4 different endings based on the path the player chooses. The consoles for this game are PS2, PS3, PC, Wii, XBox, XBox 360, PSP. Note: The PSP &amp; PS2 versions of the game are very different from that of the PS3, Wii, Xbox 360 and PC versions. Spider-Man, voiced by Benjamin Diskin appears in Ultimate Alliance 2 and is also one of the main characters. In the Pro-Registration story, he can wear his Iron Spider costume.</p><p>Spidey's next video game adventure was released on September 7th, 2010, in the form of <b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</b>. In this game, you can play as four distinct Spider-Men in four different universes, in search of the shattered pieces of a legendary tablet. The game sometimes features sequences where the player is in first person and has to use the analog stick to win the fight, much like in some boxing games. The first dimension is the Amazing Universe (Earth 616), the world of regular comics Spider-Man that we know and love, voiced by Neil Patrick Harris. He uses mainly far-range combat to defeat his enemies, it is known he faces Sandman in this dimension. The second is the Noir Universe, which takes place in the 1940s, in a darker, stealthier, and grittier setting, where stealth and timing is crucial. In this dimension, Spider-Man Faces Hammerhead, Green Goblin and the Vulture. The third is 2099, taking place mostly in the skies, with many free falling levels. In this dimension, Spider-Man faces the Hobgoblin with a new, more advanced look. The final dimension is the Ultimate Universe, where Spider-Man has somehow been reunited with the Venom symbiote as his \"gift\" from Madame Webb. He battles Deadpool and many other bosses with symbiote tendrils and many more attacks. Carnage is the main boss of this dimension. In the end you battle a immensely empowered god-level Mysterio.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1862583\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1862583\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/48887/1862583-spider_man_shattered_dimensions_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Spider-Man's latest video game, entitled <b>Spider-Man: Edge of Time</b>, developed by Activision and Beenox, the latter being given free reign after the success of Shattered Dimensions, which bears a similar gameplay concept. The game involves Peter Parker and his future counterpart Miguel O'Hara. New villain created for the game, Walker Sloan, has created a time machine in order to go back in time and start Alchemex, the company which Miguel works for, now was established in his own views in the seventies. Miguel proceeds to stop him but is caught in the portal after Sloan has entered and somehow becomes a \"viewer\" in the events. This gives him the ability to communicate with Peter Parker, who now works for Alechemex in this time altered universe, and everything he does directly affects the year 2099. Both briefly navigate their own timelines until circumstances force them to switch, now residing in timelines alien to them they traverse obstacles in order to get home through the temporal portal and solve the dystopian effects of the timeline corruption. The two work together to prevent Peter's death at the hands of Anti-Venom, save Mary Jane from multiple danger, and even take on the CEO of Alchemex. Currently Beenox has been given rights to the creation of all future Spider-Man games.</p><p>Spider-Man is an unlockable character in the Facebook game <b>Marvel: Avengers Alliance</b>. As an Infiltrator, he gains the Combat Awareness buff after attacking Tacticians. He has tremendous agility and an appropriate repertoire of powers, including: web-based attacks and his Spider Sense. He starts with his traditional red &amp; blue costume, but players can purchase the black costume to fight as an ebony Infiltrator or a nefarious Bruiser.

Her royal heritage can be traced back since the dawn of humanity and her family's kingdom lies hidden in the Great Rift Valley of Africa, the valley that spawned the human race itself. The power in her family is transferred from mother to daughter. Her mother, Princess <a href=\"../../ndare-munroe/42526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N'Dare</a>, rebelled against their tradition as she felt that she was forced to do the role that was given to her. She then married an American photojournalist, <a href=\"../../david-munroe/21956/\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Munroe</a>, and they lived in Manhattan. They moved to Cairo, Egypt when Ororo was still an infant. When Ororo was five, she and her family were caught in an Arab-Israeli conflict. Her parents were killed and Ororo ended up buried under rubble next to her mother's body. Because of this, Ororo has a life long struggle to overcome her severe claustrophobia. Ororo was never sought after by her own people in fear of her safety as her own uncle, Shetani, who felt left out and wanted to rule, threatened that he would kill Ororo should her people even try to find her. Storm, by birth, is the rightful heir to her family's kingdom and to the oldest royal family on the face of the Earth.</p><h2>Creation</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2090045\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51192/2090045-tumblr_lus0hjhuve1r11ge4o1_500.jpg\" title=\"Worlds Apart\"><img id=\"2090045\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51192/2090045-tumblr_lus0hjhuve1r11ge4o1_500_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Worlds Apart\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Worlds Apart</div></div></div></div><p>Storm was created by the writer <a href=\"../../len-wein/26-41457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Len Wein</a> and artist <a href=\"../../dave-cockrum/26-4447/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dave Cockrum</a> and made her first ever appearance in <i>Giant Size X-Men</i> # 1 in May 1975.

During an interview in 1999, Len Wein explained that the original black female character of Legion would have been named The Black Cat and wore a similar costume to Storm but without the cape and sported cat-like haircut and ears. However, due to other female cat-like characters like <a href=\"../../tigra/29-21188/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tigra</a> appearing, Dave Cockrum decided to re-design the new character and give her white hair and a black cape and the name Storm.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2505396\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/2505396-lookn.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2505396\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/2505396-lookn_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Storm has always played a very prominent role in the world of the X-Men. In her early days after her first appearance she was a major character in the new team of X-Men following the relaunch of the mutant team in 1975. Then perhaps her definitive role was as leader of the X-Men after <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor X</a> went into space with the <a href=\"../../starjammers/65-14871/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starjammers</a> for a time. She led the team through many huge challenges: the Mutant Massacre and Inferno to name but two, even through a long period when she had lost her powers. Following the return of Professor X, the X-Men were split into two teams, Gold (led by Storm) and Blue (led by <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a>). During that period her closest male relationship was with <a href=\"../../forge/29-4279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a>, however due to Storm being busy with the X-Men all the time, Forge felt left out and knew that her heart would always be with the X-Men and not with him which ended with the two breaking up. Following the discovery of <a href=\"../../destinys-diaries/18-44250/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destiny's diaries</a>, Storm led the X-Treme X-Men and then the X.S.E. teams. Most recently Storm has married <a href=\"../../black-panther/29-1477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Panther</a> and taken on a new leadership role in <a href=\"../../wakanda/34-41027/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wakanda</a>.</p><p>Following the events of Doom War, both Storm and T'challa have left Wakanda for more heroic duties, Storm is now a main-stay member of the X-Men yet again and is currently leading the Utopia Security Team.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"292439\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/292439-155811-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men\"><img id=\"292439\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/292439-155811-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>As an orphan in Cairo, Ororo was forced to live on the streets. She was taken in by <a href=\"../../achmed-el-gibar/29-26034/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Achmed El-Gibar</a> who taught her the many skills of thievery and hand to hand combat. While in Cairo, Storm has her first encounter with <a href=\"../../professor-x/1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles Xavier</a>, a powerful telepath who would go on form the team of mutants called the <a href=\"../../x-men/3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a>. Through Ororo's attempt to pick Xavier's pocket, Charles meets the <a href=\"../../shadow-king/29-14889/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King</a>. Storm also proves her skills as a thief by stealing a rare ruby-colored gem, the so-called \"heart of eternal darkness\" against Achmed's orders. Years later, it would be discovered that this stone contained the essence of the immortal mutant <a href=\"../../candra/29-7900/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Candra</a>.</p><p>Years later, Ororo leaves <a href=\"../../egypt/34-55877/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egypt</a> and returns to her ancestral homeland of <a href=\"../../kenya/34-55951/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kenya</a>. On the way there, Ororo accepts a ride with a man who attempts to rape her. Ororo killed the man with a knife, but swears never to take a life again. After nearly dying of thirst in the Sahara desert, Ororo learns that she has the power to control the weather. She also learns that <a href=\"../../republic-of-south-africa/34-55912/\" rel=\"nofollow\">South Africa</a>ns, under the leadership of <a href=\"../../andreas-de-ruyter/29-63537/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andreas de Ruyter,</a> were trying to kidnap Prince <a href=\"../../black-panther/29-1477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">T'Challa of Wakanda</a>, who was a little older than her. Storm uses her powers to help him escape, and the two travel together for a while, growing attracted to each other, but Ororo's dream and T'Challa's duty meant they couldn't be together yet.</p><p>Making her home in the Serengeti Plain in Kenya, Storm calls out to her goddess and is answered with the sight of a shining figure of a woman, who resembles her. Adopted as a goddess of life by the local tribes, Storm helps however she can, with her powers. The connection between the weather and her emotional state lead her to detach herself from stronger emotions as far as possible to protect the people. An elderly tribal woman, Ainet, helps her learn how to responsibly use her complex powers. When a threat arises from a fellow mutant called <a href=\"../../deluge/29-58090/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deluge</a>, who had wrested control over the weather from her in an attempt to revenge himself on humanity. Ororo managed to destroy Deluge and disperse the storm with the help of the X-Men, stranded in Kenya at that time. The X-Men inform Professor X about this promising mutant, however, he already knows of her, but hadn\u2019t contacted her before because he thought the cultural shock would be too much for her to handle.</p><h3>Joining the X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1215756\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4762/1215756-storm_marker_sketch_in_color_by_portela_super.jpg\" title=\"Storm\"><img id=\"1215756\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4762/1215756-storm_marker_sketch_in_color_by_portela_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Storm\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Storm</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually however, Xavier is left with no choice but to contact Ororo and ask her assistance in rescuing the X-Men, explaining to her that she was not a goddess but a mutant. Ororo agrees to join the X-Men and returns to live in America. The new X-Men's first mission tasks them with rescuing the original X-Men from the living island of <a href=\"../../krakoa/29-26409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Krakoa</a>. Acclimatizing to life in America, Ororo was naive in the ways of the modern world; for example, she had no idea why there was any need for clothing, if one didn\u2019t feel cold.</p><p>Storm quickly makes friends among the X-Men, regarding them as a family, with an especially strong bond of friendship with <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey</a>, who helped Ororo to buy a new wardrobe. It was during one of their shopping tours that Jean learned of Storm\u2019s severe claustrophobia when the two women were chasing a thief into a subway station.</p><h3>Deadly Genesis</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"771745\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/771745-140_uncanny_x_men__first_cl_super.jpg\" title=\"Second Generation\"><img id=\"771745\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/771745-140_uncanny_x_men__first_cl_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Second Generation\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Second Generation</div></div></div></div><p>When the X-Men are taken into <a href=\"../../space/34-56254/\" rel=\"nofollow\">space</a> by the Sentinels and held as prisoners in Lang's sentinel factory above Earth, during their escape they are forced to use a damaged space craft to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. With Jean as the only person on board who would survive long enough to pilot the ship, everyone else remains protected in the radiation room. Jean is replaced by the <a href=\"../../dark-phoenix/29-9731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phoenix</a> during the reentry. To get away from all the stress the team decides to take a vacation to <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee's</a> home Cassidy Keep. When they get there they are attacked by <a href=\"../../juggernaut/29-1445/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juggernaut</a> and Banshee's cousin <a href=\"../../black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>. Storm suffers extreme claustrophobia from being confined inside the castle, but when she is finally able to get outside she turns the battle in favor of the X-Men.</p><p>While still in <a>Scotland</a> the X-Men go to <a>Muir Island,</a> to the lab of <a>Moira McTaggert</a> to check on her research.

Magneto easily defeats the entire team, helped by the fact that two of its strongest members are made of metal.</p><p>Eric the Red reveals that he is actually a Shi'ar spy sent to Earth to capture the fugitive Princess <a>Lilandra</a>, who had been in psychic contact with Charles Xavier, and they had fallen in love. When Eric takes her back to Shi'ar space Xavier sends the X-Men after them and they battle the entire <a>Imperial Guard</a>. After their battle the X-Men, along with the Shi'ar ruler <a>D'Ken</a>, are sucked into the <a>M\u2019Kraan Crystal</a>. Phoenix repairs the crystal, thus saving the universe. Storm and the rest of the X-Men return to Earth but are soon after kidnapped by Magneto and held prisoner in the <a>Savage Land</a>. Magneto punishes the team for his time stuck as an infant and binds them so they can't move or speak. However, Storm is able to use her skills as a master lock-pick to break the restraints and she frees the rest of the team. T</p><p>hey attack Magneto and he destroys his hidden headquarters in an attempt to kill them. The X-Men are split in two groups, Phoenix and <a>Beast</a> are propelled out of the Savage Land to <a>Antarctica</a> and the rest of the team is imprisoned underground in the Savage Land. Phoenix and Beast return to America believing their teammates killed, while Storm and the X-Men adapt to life in their temporary home in the village of <a>Ka-Zar</a> and help him defeat the tyrant <a>Garokk</a>. However, Storm blames herself for the accidental death of Garokk, which leaves her traumatized. Storm then distances herself from the other X-Men and wandered around the Savage Land on her own where she saves a mysterious woman, M'rin, from a savage beast. Finding herself in another fantastic dimension adjacent to the Savage Land, M\u2019rin - who is this dimension\u2019s warrior queen - befriends Ororo and regards her as her surrogate daughter. Before Storm leaves, M\u2019rin showed her how to use her mother\u2019s ruby crystal to open the dimensional gates and come visit her, if she wishes.</p><h3>Asgardian Wars</h3><p>As the X-Men leave the Savage Land aboard a raft, they are caught in a massive gale that brings them to Japan where Storm and the team help battle <a href=\"../../moses-magnum/29-11915/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moses Magnum</a>. Flying back from Japan in a plane, the team are blown off course and forced to land in Calgary, Alberta. <a href=\"../../alpha-flight/65-14616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Flight</a> had been instructed to bring in <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a> and they found to be responsible for misdirecting the X-Men's plane. As the battle reaches its climax, Storm has to use her powers like never before to quell a blizzard, summoned by <a href=\"../../shaman/29-5017/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shaman</a> that grows out of his control, spanning the size of the Canadian continent. While successful, the effort required leaves her physically exhausted. Back in New York, Storm decides to visit the apartment in Harlem, where her parents fell in love and where she was born.</p><p>Arriving at the building where her family used to live, she is shocked to find out that it was now occupied by some drug addicted kids. She meets her friends, <a href=\"../../misty-knight/29-1491/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Misty Knight</a> and <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a>, who remind her that there is only so much that superheroes can do. This causes Ororo to start to doubt her life as an X-Man. Some time later, Storm is kidnapped by <a href=\"../../arkon/29-19947/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkon the Imperion</a>, emperor of the other-dimensional world Polemachus, who wanted someone with control over lightning to restore the machine that kept the energy-rings around their world. Ororo is actually willing to help, even though it would have cost her life. With the aid of the other X-Men, any loss of life was avoided. This adventure reminded her that life as an X-Man was more than just one battle after the next.</p><p>When a new student, the teenager <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitty Pryde</a>, joins the X-Men, Ororo develops motherly feelings towards the girl, whose parents\u2019 marriage was disintegrating. Around the same time as this, Storm is captured and humiliated by the telepathic <a href=\"../../emma-frost/29-1457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Queen</a> (Emma Frost) who telepathically probes Ororo for information on the X-Men. When the rest of the team assaults the building, the White Queen becomes angry and almost wipes Storm's mind, but is prevented by the intervention of Phoenix.</p><h3>Doom</h3><p>After the death of Jean Grey, Cyclops leaves the team and Storm is appointed team leader by Professor Xavier, a role she is unsure about at first. Soon after this, the X-Men free the villain, <a href=\"../../arcade/29-8429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade</a>, from <a href=\"../../doctor-doom/29-1468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Doom</a> (actually, a very convincing Doom-bot) in order to get their friend Stevie Hunter back. Doom and Ororo feel some attraction towards each other; however, Doom still traps her and her fellow mutants and transforms Storm into a statue of organic chrome.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1640490\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/1640490-transformation_super.jpg\" title=\"The Transformation\"><img id=\"1640490\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/1640490-transformation_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Transformation\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Transformation</div></div></div></div><p>For a claustrophobic, this was a nightmare come true. Subconsciously, she started to warp weather patterns all over the world, creating a giant thunderstorm. When her teammates finally free her, she is immensely more powerful and close to insanity in her rage. The other X-Men make her realize she is heading down the same path as the Phoenix, and she reins in her power and stops the storm and spares Doom's life. When Storm brings Kitty to the White Queen's Massachusetts Academy on Kitty\u2019s parents' wishes, the White Queen uses a device to switch bodies with Storm. After freeing herself, it still takes Storm some time to convince Kitty that it was really her stuck inside Emma Frost\u2019s body. With their personalities restored again, Storm almost kills Emma in the final battle, but Wolverine, holds her back and reminds her that she is better than that.</p><p>Storm is then ambushed by an assassin hired by the Bull. Teaming up with the Black Panther, her first love, they locate the Bull, and defeat the Bull's robot. This also kills The Bull himself as he was psychically connected to the robot.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1459714\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1459714-storm16_super.jpg\" title=\"Storm and Arkon\"><img id=\"1459714\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1459714-storm16_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Storm and Arkon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Storm and Arkon</div></div></div></div><p>Later, Ororo and the team join the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> to return to Polemachus, the world ruled by Arkon. <a href=\"../../badoon/65-22907/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Badoon</a> had invaded and taken control of Polemachus, and had taken <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed</a> and Arkon prisoner. The teams defeat the Badoon and save both Arkon and Reed. A short time later, Storm is attacked by <a href=\"../../dracula/29-7206/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dracula</a> and turned into a vampire. Proving her strength of will rivaled his own, Storm gains the respect of Dracula who promises to relinquish his hold on her. However, Dracula later attacks Storm again, breaking his promise. He wanted to use her skills as a thief to steal a book from a monastery containing a spell that could kill him.</p><p>Dracula's daughter Lilith, had taken control of Kitty Pryde, and takes vampiric control of <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, in pursuit of Storm. Kitty and Colossus ambush Storm who flash-freezes Colossus but is injured by a crossbow bolt from Kitty. Dracula saves Storm and the X-men later arrive to assist her in defeating him. Dracula is seemingly destroyed by Kitty (Lilith) reading the Montesi Formula.

Storm flees from the others in a spaceship when she begins to transform into the Brood and uses her powers to channel nearby stars' energies into her body, killing the Brood embryo and nearly killing herself. Adrift in space, she is then saved by Prophetsinger of the Acanti, whale like space creatures who were enslaved by the Brood.</p><p>After destroying the Brood homeworld, back on Earth Storm and her team are confronted by Professor Xavier, who was the host for a Brood Queen. Again they defeat the Brood, and Professor Xavier is transferred into a cloned body. Ororo's powers briefly flare out of control and she feels that the Earth has \u201crejected her\u201d \u2013 the recent encounter with the Brood had caused her inner harmony of body and soul to shift out of balance.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1459705\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1459705-storm21_super.jpg\" title=\"Storm vs. Callisto\"><img id=\"1459705\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1459705-storm21_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Storm vs. Callisto\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Storm vs. Callisto</div></div></div></div><p>When Storm, Wolverine and Carol Danvers infiltrate the Pentagon to erase their data files, they meet Rogue, who had permanently absorbed Carol's powers. A fierce fight ensues, with Rogue absorbing Wolverine's and then Storm's powers only to be overwhelmed by this power. Storm traps Rogue within a tornado and removes her from the Pentagon so the team could escape and protect the staff at the Pentagon. Soon after, Rogue comes to the X-Men for help with controlling her powers, and Xavier agreed to allow her to join the team.</p><p>Storm is angered by this decision, but is able to set aside her feelings and accept Rogue. <a href=\"../../archangel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angel</a> is kidnapped by the <a href=\"../../morlocks/65-3191/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morlocks</a> and the X-Men go to rescue him.

Back on Earth, during a mission to help Rogue, Storm is shot by a power neutralizer meant for Rogue, and she loses her powers. She goes to the home of the mutant <a href=\"../../forge/29-4279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a> to recuperate and during this time, they fall in love. When Storm later discovers that the power neutralizer was created by Forge, she feels betrayed and ends their relationship, leaving the X-Men for Africa, where she meets <a href=\"../../andrea-von-strucker/29-4814/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andrea</a> and <a href=\"../../andreas-von-strucker/29-4815/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Andreas Von Strucker</a>. Storm battles the twins to protect a local woman, but is grazed on the temple by a bullet and is knocked out. Awakening, she travels across a desolate plain of Africa, encountering a woman who was going into labor who she helps give birth at her village. Storm comes to terms with the loss of her powers and goes to Cairo where she helps the <a href=\"../../new-mutants/65-15971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Mutants</a> defeat the Shadow King.</p><p>Storm and the New Mutants are all then transported to <a href=\"../../asgard-marvel/34-40990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asgard</a> by <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loki</a>, in a scheme of his to take over Asgard. The X-Men travel to Asgard to rescue them all. Loki tempts Storm with the title of the Goddess of Thunder and gives her Freya's cloak of magic feathers and a mystically enhanced hammer. At first she attacks Wolverine, but he is able to help Storm see through Loki's deception, and she returns to Earth with her team. Upon her return, Storm learns that Magneto had been appointed headmaster of the school by Professor X. Cyclops had returned to the X-men while Storm was on Asgard and resumed leadership of the team, but Storm challenges Cyclops in a duel for leadership and defeats him.</p><h3>Mutant Massacre</h3><p>Some time later, a group calling themselves the <a href=\"../../marauders/65-40480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marauders</a> slaughtered many of the Morlocks. The X-Men quickly ventured into the underground tunnels to investigate. They save a few survivors, but several X-Men suffer horrific injuries, when the team encounters the killers. Storm feels she had failed as a leader, but Callisto, slaps her back into taking up her responsibilities again.</p><h3>Fall of the Mutants</h3><p>With more and more enemies to mutants in general rallying against them, <a href=\"../../hellfire-club/65-13357/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Hellfire Club</a> proposes an alliance with the X-Men, offering Magneto the seat of White King. After discussing this with Ororo, he accepts, with his own condition that he and Storm would jointly take the title of White King. However, Ororo would not be not available for much longer. The Marauder Malice trying to take over Dazzler, and the bombing of the house of Jean Grey\u2019s sister, Sara, indicates that somebody is trying to get to the X-Men by harming their friends and families. As these enemies would apparently only stop once the X-Men were dead,</p><p>Storm decides to go underground by faking the team\u2019s deaths, but also realizes that, she needs her powers back. Naming Wolverine deputy leader, Storm travels to Dallas to ask for Forge\u2019s help. Finding his home derelict, she meets who she thinks is his old mentor <a href=\"../../naze/29-15143/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Naz\u00e9</a>.</p><p>Naz\u00e9 tells her that Forge (a powerful, but reluctant, Shaman) has probably been claimed by his nemesis, <a href=\"../../adversary/29-26995/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Adversary</a> and will try to destroy the world in his name. Storm accompanies Naz\u00e9 (really the Adversary in disguise) on a dangerous quest to find Forge. Storm starts to admit to herself that she still loves Forge, but is convinced that he has gone evil, thanks to Naz\u00e9\u2019s subtle manipulations. She confronts Forge on a mountain, surrounded by demons, with a gate to another dimension above him, and stabs him, only then realizing that he had in fact been trying to close the gate and save Earth.</p><p>In Dallas, time and space suddenly go crazy. Meanwhile Storm and the heavily injured Forge find themselves transported to another Earth, devoid of any human life. After spending a year there, they realize that the Adversary is giving them the chance to become parents to a new humanity on this world while destroying their own. The two decide that they have to try and save their own Earth. Forge uses the technology in his artificial leg to create an anti-Neutralizer, giving Storm back her powers and her lightning is used to energize a portal back to Earth. The magical spell to counter the one Forge cast many years ago, which had freed the Adversary, needs nine souls to give it energy. Thus, the X-Men and their companion <a href=\"../../madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madelyne Pryor</a>, on live TV, sacrifice themselves for Forge\u2019s spell. Secretly the X-Men are returned to life by <a href=\"../../roma/29-14810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roma</a>, and, following Storm\u2019s original plan they let everybody believe they are still dead, in order to better strike back at their enemies. The team relocate to the former hideout of the <a href=\"../../reavers/65-9726/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reavers</a>, in the Australian Outback. Storm gets the chance to reacquaint herself with her foster mother, M\u2019rin, during a trip to the Savage Land.</p><h3>Inferno</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1459954\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1459954-storm37_super.jpg\" title=\"Lil' Storm &amp; Gambit\"><img id=\"1459954\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1459954-storm37_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lil' Storm &amp; Gambit\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lil' Storm & Gambit</div></div></div></div><p>When Madelyne Pryor, with <a href=\"../../sym/29-10291/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'ym</a> and <a href=\"../../nastirh/29-42869/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N'astirh</a> release a demon invasion of Earth, the X-Men meet X-Factor (the original 5 X-Men) for the first time. Some initial tension is soon overcome and Storm is happily reunited with her best friend. Storm destroys the demon N\u2019astirh by overloading his circuitry with her lightning. Cyclops is shocked that Storm just wanted to get the job done, by any means necessary. Back at their headquarters in the Australian Outback, the X-Men are attacked by the psychotic <a href=\"../../nanny/29-7567/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nanny</a> and her underling, the <a href=\"../../orphan-maker/29-25911/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Orphan Maker</a> who capture Storm and fake her death with the help of a <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a> <a href=\"../../life-model-decoy/18-42286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">life model decoy</a>. The villains escape and once back in their base, Nanny physically and mentally reduces Storm to her pre-teens to better control her. However, Storm\u2019s claustrophobia gives her the strength to overload Nanny\u2019s systems and she escapes. The now approximately 11-12 year old Ororo finds herself in the city of Cairo, Illinois with no memories of her time with the X-Men or even why she was in America.</p><p>Her powers hardly worked either, due to her youth. The Shadow King takes this opportunity to hunt her down. Taking over the body of FBI agent Jacob Reisz, he frames Ororo for murder. During a caper as a thief the Shadow King has his agents waiting for Ororo, but she is saved by a fellow mutant and thief named <a href=\"../../gambit/29-1499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gambit</a>. Gambit is intrigued and they form a partnership, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. Nanny finds them again, but they manage to beat her and destroy her aircraft, at the same time reactivating Storm\u2019s memories of what had happened to her and who she had been. Gambit and Storm are reunited with Banshee and Forge at the X-Mansion, as well with the New Mutants, <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cable</a> and X-Factor. Tests reveal that Ororo is stuck as a young girl, not able to grow or age and without full access to her powers.</p><h3>X-Tinction Agenda</h3><p>The <a href=\"../../genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genoshan</a> government, working together with old X-Factor enemy, <a href=\"../../cameron-hodge/29-13379/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cameron Hodge</a>, plan to destroy the various X-Teams as revenge for an earlier defeat. They kidnap Storm and several New Mutants. In custody, Storm undergoes the conditioning process that the Genoshans had developed to turn mutants or mutates into obedient, mindless slaves. She is stripped of free will and is called Mutate 20. However, Genegineer <a href=\"../../genegineer-david-moreau/29-28470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moreau</a> and Chief Magistrate Anderson are among the faction working against Hodge and use Storm in a Trojan Horse gambit against him. When Storm attacks Cyclops on Anderson\u2019s orders, Storm not only regains both her faculties and her adult body, she also is given the means to reactivate the neutralized powers of the other captured X-Men.</p><h3>Muir Island Saga and X-men Gold Team</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"641065\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30665/641065-x_men__7__super.jpg\" title=\"Gold Team\"><img id=\"641065\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30665/641065-x_men__7__medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gold Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gold Team</div></div></div></div><p>Back on Muir Island, the Shadow King takes over the minds of the residents of the Research Facility.

The arrival of the new X-Man, <a href=\"../../bishop/29-1503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bishop</a>, from the future, further strains the relationship between Storm and Forge, a relationship that was already on the rocks. Forge proposes to Storm, but Ororo hesitates. Jean Grey refuses to tell Forge about Storm\u2019s true feelings, and he becomes convinced that Storm didn\u2019t love him and could never be a complete person outside the X-Men.</p><p>He retracts his proposal and leaves to help Mystique, although it turns out Storm would have said \u201cyes.\u201d After an incident in which <a href=\"../../mikhail-rasputin/29-14830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mikhail Rasputin</a>, Colossus' mad brother floods the Morlock tunnels, apparently killing them all, Forge invites Storm to dinner where they make up. While they don't fully resume their relationship, they remain more than friends.</p><h3>Return to the Morlocks</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1460014\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1460014-storm43_super.jpg\" title=\"Marrow's Heart\"><img id=\"1460014\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/37452/1460014-storm43_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Marrow's Heart\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Marrow's Heart</div></div></div></div><p>Behind the scenes, actually Mikhail had transported the Morlocks to another dimension, where time passed faster. Children had grown up in the time since the X-Men saw them last and one group called the <a href=\"../../gene-nation/65-15347/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gene Nation</a>, led by <a href=\"../../marrow/29-13726/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marrow</a> \u2013 want revenge on the humans who had shunned the Morlocks. They plan another massacre on the anniversary of the Morlock Massacre. Storm confronts Marrow, and in single combat cuts out the girl\u2019s heart, before the bomb attached to it could explode. Unaware of the fact that Marrow had survived, as she actually had two hearts, Storm is deeply troubled by her choice, feeling that she was incapable of making working long-term decisions. While celebrating the Ceremony of Light as a remembrance ritual in the Morlock tunnels, she is teleported away by Mikhail Rasputin to his other dimension, where she was to become \u201cmother\u201d to the Morlocks. Storm learns that Rasputin actually backed Gene Nation. She forces him to return all the surviving Morlocks back to Earth and gives the Gene Nation members a choice. Either help rebuild the impoverished African village she had once visited \u2013 or else.</p><p>Storm then presented a new look to her teammates. During that time Storm also called off her on-again-off again relationship with Forge for good, since she couldn\u2019t imagine a long-term future with him and started a subtle flirtation with Cable instead. Storm once more confronted Candra \u2013 who had by now learned that Storm had stolen her heart as a child \u2013 over the fate of the children Jamil and Karima. After facing several old foes and friends who couldn\u2019t possibly be there, Storm realized that Karima was a powerful mutant with the ability to make desires real and that Jamil was only an expression of her own desires. When Cyclops destroyed the ruby that contained Candra\u2019s essence, Storm\u2019s opponent perished and Ororo returned Karima home.</p><p>After Cyclops and Phoenix leave the team to recuperate, Storm is once more leader of the X-Men, now including Marrow who tries to provoke her at every point and whose very presence reminds Storm of her own failures. Storm and Marrow make peace though, thanks in part to Marrow's burgeoning friendship with <a href=\"../../cannonball/29-1496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball</a>. Following the restructuring of the X-Men, Storm takes a less active role and joins a division of the X-Men that travels around the world to face new threats in Venice, Italy, and Russia.</p><h3>X-Treme X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"55102\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/55102-9411-76558-1-x-treme-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Treme X-Men\"><img id=\"55102\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/55102-9411-76558-1-x-treme-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Treme X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Treme X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly after her brief leave of absence, the X-Men learn of the <a href=\"../../destinys-diaries/18-44250/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diaries</a> of the late precog <a href=\"../../destiny/29-3557/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destiny</a>, which chronicled the future. With only one book in their possession, Ororo realizes that the diaries are too a dangerous weapon to be trusted to Charles Xavier following the incident with <a href=\"../../onslaught/29-13352/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onslaught</a>. Planning to find the rest of the diaries, Ororo asks Tessa AKA <a href=\"../../sage/29-4559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage</a> to be among her group, as her analytical skills would be needed to make sense of the cryptic prophecies. However, the team is best with difficulties from the very beginning, not the least of which is the death of Storm's teammate <a href=\"../../psylocke/29-3176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psylocke</a> at the hand of Vargas, who claims to be the true Homo Superior. Gambit asks Storm for the ruby she had inherited from her mother, which is part of a mysterious powerful group of gems called the Madripoor set. The ruby, as well as the other gems, is stolen by the other-dimensional warrior Shaitan, who also abducts Gambit. Shaitan uses the gems and Gambit\u2019s power to create a portal - a giant space needle in the making - to allow the other-dimensional armies of his master Khan, a conqueror of whole universes, to enter Madripoor. At the same time a force field prevents other heroes from entering Madripoor to help.</p><p>After Storm saves Khan's life from Madripoor crime lord Viper, Khan becomes obsessed with Storm, recognizing in her a kindred spirit and an equal. When Viper strikes Ororo in the back, leaving her for dead, Khan takes her with him to another dimension, saved her life and was goingto make her his queen. Storm tried to convince him to stop his attempted conquest of Earth. Meanwhile, the other X-Men race against time to try and find Storm and to stop Khan\u2019s troops gaining access to Earth. Khan\u2019s concubines jealously try to murder Storm but she defeats them despite her injuries. Together, the X-Men manage to successfully stop the Invasion by sabotaging Khan\u2019s castle and blowing up the inter-dimensional portal, seemingly blowing Khan\u2019s ship up in the process. Ororo\u2019s serious injuries cause her to collapse, and have a near death experience but she wakes up again and has physical therapy for her back and legs. With their mission to find the diaries over (since Rogue now has access to them, thanks to her powers), the other X-Men ask Storm\u2019s team to return to the mansion. Storm, Sage and Bishop however, feel that someone has to defend the rights of humans and make sure that they <i>all</i> could co-exist peacefully. Storm and Gambit infiltrate a meeting of world leaders on mutant policy at the president's home. Storm makes Val Cooper, Alexi Vazjin and several other politicians an offer: she suggests a special police task force of mutants policing mutants given worldwide authority \u2013 the X.S.E. The idea is given a green light but, as a test, she is sent to Tokyo to apprehend the extra-dimensional slaver, Tullamore Voge. There she meets with her good friend Yukio. At a nightclub, Storm intervenes in a mutant vs. mutant fight in an underground arena and unwittingly became the new champion. Excited by the thrill and the rush, Ororo returns and fights Callisto. This battle turned out to be a trap; Callisto has new powers - tentacles in the place of her arms - and the fight was only a distraction for Storm to be defeated psychically, by operatives of Callisto\u2019s master, Masque.</p><p>Storm and Callisto then outwardly live as champions, while remaining the slaves of Masque. However they defeat Masque before they can be sold as slaves to Tullamore Voge. Storm hands over control of the arenas to Callisto, to make them an organization offering safe harbor to mutants all over the world. Voge escapes, but his activities in Tokyo are brought to an end so the X.S.E. are given the go-ahead. After returning to her teammates, Ororo learns of the devastation of Manhattan at the hand of a madman claiming to be Magneto and the death of Jean Grey. Storm\u2019s team returned to Westchester to help rebuild the Xavier Institute, which now houses both the X-Men and the X.S.E. Professor Xavier departs to Genosha, and Cyclops and Emma Frost function as headmasters of the Institute.</p><h3>The X.S.E.</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"563501\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/563501-uncanny450_17hu_super.jpg\" title=\"Storm and Wolverine\"><img id=\"563501\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/563501-uncanny450_17hu_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Storm and Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Storm and Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p>The X.S.E. is given global authority as a mutant police force to maintain peace between humans and mutants. Storm is field leader with Bishop, Sage, Cannonball, <a href=\"../../rachel-summers/29-3566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Girl</a> (Rachel Grey), <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> and Wolverine as team members. They easily beat the Weaponeers, a group of arms dealing terrorists, in the Sahara desert. Their next mission is against the extra-dimensional Fury, a super-adaptive robot with immense power. The Fury defeats the combined forces of Bishop, Marvel Girl and Cannonball at Captain Britain's ancestral home, and then takes control of Sage through her cyber glasses. Storm is able to overcome this by absorbing lightning into herself. Storm, Wolverine and Nightcrawler find that Sage is too difficult a challenge to overcome, but Fury's control over Sage is weakened and she is able to free herself after being hit by an EMP from Storm. While the Fury is briefly neutralized, Storm, Bishop, Sage and Marvel Girl, combine powers to create a miniature black hole in which they trap it.</p><p>En route to dinner with the Queen of England, the team is ambushed and kidnapped by Viper in revenge for her defeat during Khan's invasion and she takes them to Murderworld, threatening to kill the Queen of England. The team manages to escape and their powers return. Viper had actually only kidnapped one of the Queen's maids, but she was trapped in an amusement park ride with a baby nuke that would explode if they enter. Nightcrawler teleports into the pod and saves the maid while Storm's air pressure field contains the nuclear blast long enough to save everyone.</p><p>Storm and Logan go on a date but are interrupted when they hear of some murders that implicate Wolverine from some suspicious claw marks. They investigate and find <a href=\"../../x-23/29-3560/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-23</a>, the killer, at a nightclub. X-23 escapes after slashing Wolvie. Storm and Rachel catch up to X-23 and neutralize her, learning her identity and why she was actually on the trail of <a href=\"../../bacchae/65-6796/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Bacchae</a>. The Bacchae - a team of women warriors - are defeated by Storm's team, thus freeing a man that was a friend of X-23. The team are then attacked by Geech, who takes down most of the team before Storm and Wolverine beat him. They then set about finding Sage, who did not return after their encounter with Viper. Storm and Bishop find Sage at the Paris branch, dressed in her old Hellfire Club garments and standing with <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a> and <a href=\"../../sunspot/29-4644/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunspot</a>, the club's latest Black King. The Cleaning Crew led by <a href=\"../../donald-pierce/29-3556/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Donald Pierce</a> the club's White Bishop, attack but Storm manages to escape. Storm, Wolverine and Kurt join the battle, and are able to defeat Donald Pierce, knocking off Pierce's head, but not before suffering serious injuries. Sage decides to remain with the Hellfire Club to assist Roberto DeCosta.</p><p>Traveling to Spain, the team find Psylocke revived from her death at the hands of Vargas. With Psylocke they travel to the Savage Land to find that Logan and X-23, who had hid in Logan's ship to go with him, are under attack. Storm and Rachel neutralize the attackers - the Hauk'ka, a race of saurians - with a combination of blinding snow and sensory perception alteration. However, a team of super powered saurians - Kaidan, with powerful telepathic powers, Raina, with super strength, and Masano, who could fly, take down the mutants and the team is captured and imprisoned. Using Rachel to amplify her powers, Storm was being used to generate massive hyper storms all around the world to destroy all human life on the planet. Psylocke and X-23 manage to save Bishop and Nightcrawler, and together with Kazar and the Savage Land mutates they capture Raina, Masano and Kaidan, and convince them that only mutual destruction is assured by their storms. They agree to join with the X-Men to save the world. Brainchild, who lied to them about saving Storm, is taken down by X-23 and Kaidan reverses his effect on Rachel. Together, Storm and Rachel are able to stop the hyper storms, and save the world.</p><p>Back at the Xavier Institute, Storm is reunited with Colossus, believed dead after his heroic suicide some time before. The team is then attacked by Mojo and Spiral, who teleport in with Nocturne and Juggernaut. Spiral used her magic to transform the team into the X-Babies, but Psylocke helps them to escape. The team then fight the Exiles, who are under Mojo's control. Once they are defeated, Juggernaut takes down Spiral, and then Mojo is subsequently defeated by the X-Men.</p><h3>Wakanda and Marriage</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074378\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074378-116055_102818_storm_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Marriage\"><img id=\"1074378\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074378-116055_102818_storm_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Marriage\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Marriage</div></div></div></div><p>When the <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch</a> goes crazy and creates an alternate world in which all mutants had their wishes fulfilled, after being brought back to reality she freaks out and depowers the majority of the world's mutants. The X.S.E. cease operations, and Ororo returns to Africa in order to protect former mutants. During this time, she is reunited with T'Challa, the <a href=\"/black-panther/29-1477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Panther</a> and king of <a href=\"../../wakanda/41027/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wakanda</a>. T'Challa proposes to her and Ororo accepts. Their marriage coincides with the superhuman <a href=\"../../civil-war/40615/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civil War</a> brewing in America, and their wedding is riddled with disagreement and fighting between heroes on both sides. After their wedding, Storm and T'Challa go on a royal world tour. Their first stop is Dr. Doom's castle in <a href=\"../../latveria/41031/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Latveria</a> at Doom's request. After battling a legion of <a href=\"../../doombots/11924/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doombots</a>, they escape and visit <a href=\"../../namor/1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> in <a href=\"../../atlantis/41030/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlantis</a>, who does not receive them well.

At the conclusion of Civil War, Storm and her husband make a temporary home in the <a href=\"../../baxter-building/34-41454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baxter Building</a> and fill in for Reed and <a href=\"../../invisible-woman/29-2190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sue Richards</a> of the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a>. When Reed and Sue return, Ororo and T'Challa moved back to Wakanda.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>T'Challa is viciously attacked by Dr. Doom and his forces, and is left in a coma. During his time in recovery, Storm takes political control of Wakanda, and nominates Shuri to go before the Panther God. As Shuri goes on her quest to seek the Panther God's approval, Ororo and Queen Mother, <a href=\"../../queen-mother/29-59943/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramonda</a> seek out the help of the witch doctor <a href=\"../../zawavari/29-60980/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zawavari</a>. Because of her spirit and strong connection to T'Challa, it was decided that Zawavari would used his magics to send Ororo into <a href=\"../../limbo/34-42990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">limbo</a> so that she could rescue her husband. In limbo, T'Challa is successfully fighting off death and his forces, but it soon becomes too much, and he is about to be dragged off into the next life. Suddenly, a powerful wind sent all of his enemies flying away from him and Storm appears with lightning in both hands. In a bid to free T'Challa, Storm levels Death and his minions with a fierce wind attack, and reveals that the only way she could save T'Challa was to give her life in his place. Fortunately for the both of them, <a href=\"../../shuri/29-58997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shuri</a>, his sister and the new Black Panther, is able to lure and trap Morlun in their place, saving them both.</p><h3>Doom War and Loss of Husband</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1253939\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/1253939-o___the_dm_super.jpg\" title=\"Storm Vs.

Storm meanwhile, used her powers to save the crops in the country but could not ascertain why they were still dying. In an unexpected confrontation with a mob, Storm blasted an angry farmer with lightning when he appeared to have drawn a weapon on her and was put on trial for crimes of treason, practicing witchcraft and crimes against humanity, and was imprisoned. Storm used her lockpicking skills as a former thief to pick the lock on her cell, but was captured by Doctor Doom, and forced to pick the lock to the vibranium vault under threat of the Queen mother and others being killed. Storm managed to pick all but the last of the locks before T'Challa finally reached Doom and Storm, who was released as Doom passed the final lock and met the Panther God.</p><p>Doom passes the test by convincing the Panther God of his vision of humanity in his \"Doom World\". Storm, Black Panther (Shuri), the Dora Milaje and the Fantastic Four (Sue, Johnny and Ben) attack networks and vibranium storage facilities throughout the world. While on this mission, Storm and her team of Dora Milaje are surprise attacked by a massive vibranium-enhanced Kracken, but Storm successfully defeated it. Becoming one with the alien metal, Doom used his power to control any object or structure that contains vibranium to initiate attacks worldwide. Launching a final offensive, the team met Doom on the battlefield, and T'Challa used shadow physics to combine alchemy with quantum science in a way that would make vibranium useless, instantly defeating Doom. Storm destroys all the doombots in a massive multi-pronged lightning strike. Storm returns to Wakanda with her husband, storing the remaining portions of the recovered pure vibranium with the aid.</p><p>After T'Challa abdicated his throne at the conclusion of Doom War, he left his homeland and took Daredevil's place as the protector of Hell's Kitchen. Though Storm initally agreed to stay apart from her husband and promised to not interfere in T'Challa's mission of self discovery, Storm broke her promise and had Pixie teleport her to Hells Kitchen to save T'Challa from a fatal fall. Storm and T'Challa worked together to take down Kraven and save a boy, Brian, who was the reason T'Challa and Kraven had come into conflict.</p><h3>Astonishing X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1467445\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/78917/1467445-saving_abigail_super.jpg\" title=\"Saving Abigail\"><img id=\"1467445\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/78917/1467445-saving_abigail_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Saving Abigail\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Saving Abigail</div></div></div></div><p>Storm continued to be an active member of the X-Men, fighting along side both the Astonishing and Uncanny teams. Storm helps save <a href=\"../../sword/65-41666/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SWORD</a> agent <a href=\"../../abigail-brand/29-4441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abigail Brand</a> from certain death while plummeting toward Earth after her starship was damaged. It is then revealed that someone had hacked into the research files that Beast maintained in reference to his attempts to find ways to reactivate the mutant gene. The culprit, only identified as Kaga. Storm, the X-Men and Agent Brand gain entrance into one of Kaga's transport vessels and, after being attacked, managed to find and defeat him.</p><p>Storm later lead a team of X-Men that consisted of Beast, Kitty Pryde, Colossus and Lockheed, into space to save Hank's girlfriend Abigail Brand, who along with several scientists and other agents aboard an off-shoot S.W.O.R.D. space station, had been taken and infected by the Brood. The Brood was using special S.W.O.R.D. technology that could safely and repeated remove the Brood progeny from a single host to repopulate their species. After repelling several attacks, and overcoming their own planned Brood infections, the team defeated the Brood, with Storm killing one of the queens with a lightning bolt, reversed their infections, and saved a new species of Brood that could peacefully co-exist with other life forms (later became Broo at the Jean Grey School For Gifted Youngsters).</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1766726\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/1766726-tempest_super.jpg\" title=\"Fighting the Nimrod\"><img id=\"1766726\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/1766726-tempest_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting the Nimrod\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fighting the Nimrod</div></div></div></div><p>When Storm, along with other members of the X-Men, is made aware of Cyclops' black ops team, <a href=\"../../x-force/65-15595/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Force</a>, she is disgusted by the idea that he would put such a team together but, due to the situation at hand, she leaves it alone, promising to have a long talk with him after the current events are handled.</p><p>It appears that <a href=\"../../bastion/29-40568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bastion</a>, has assembled some of the X-Men's most deadliest adversaries in an all out effort to destroy the mutant race. The cabal includes <a href=\"../../cameron-hodge/29-13379/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cameron Hodge</a>, <a href=\"../../william-stryker/29-40564/\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Stryker</a>, <a href=\"../../graydon-creed/29-13351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graydon Creed</a> and <a href=\"../../steven-lang/29-14861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steven Lang</a> and a large army of anti-mutant soldiers and powerful Sentinels from a future time line. Trapped in a nearly indestructible dome of energy among her fellow mutants with a portal connected to the time line bringing in more sentinel units, Storm battles on the front lines.</p><p>She is nearly killed but saved by <a href=\"../../hope-summers/29-49329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hope</a>. At the conclusion, Storm approaches both Cyclops and <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a> about X-Force. She tells Wolverine that X-Men don't kill and that his actions make him no better than the enemy. Logan tells her that if he had the chance he'd do it all over again. She sits down to have a beer with him and tells him that this could be the last drink they will ever share.</p><h3>Regenesis - X-Men</h3><p>Cyclops appointed Storm as leader of the security team, which consisted of Psylocke, Warpath, Jubilee, Domino and Colossus. The team was dispatched to retrieve Domino, whom they had lost contact with when she was attacked during a mission in Kupernicstan involving a sentinel smuggling ring. As they approached their destination, the team was confronted and told to leave the area by War Machine. Feining compliance Storm and her team proceeded to Kupernicstan anyway but was confronted a second time by a then agitated War Machine. Storm and Colossus briefly battled War Machine while the remaining team continued on to find Domino, who had been taken down by a sentinel and captured by a rogue government military squad, who planned on attacking their rival neighboring country of Symkaria with an army of sentinels. After coming to an understanding, War Machine helped Storm's team battle a sentinel while the others met up with Domino, who managed to escape her captors, but not until after they managed to use her mutant powers to manipulate the sentinels into attacking any target they wanted, and not just mutants. As Storm, Colossus and War Machine defeated the sentinel, the Kupernicstan governor launched all of the sentinels they had against Symkaria, but Storm managed to stop their progression toward their target with a category 5 hurricane long enough for the rest of the team to defeat the rogue military group and deactivate the sentinels.</p><p>At the end of their battle in Kupernicstan, Storm discovered Jubilee was missing, and set out with her team to find her. After weeks of searching, Jubilee was found to be on a remote island in China wtih a group of vampires called The Forgiven. Storm ordered her team to take down the vampires, with Storm battling Nighteyes, but Jubilee ended the conflict before it further escalated. As the two teams talked they discovered that the island was swarmed by various groups of assassins for hire, who had come to kill Raizo Kodo, leader of The Forgiven. Combining their efforts, the team defeated the assassins, with Jubilee choosing to stay with The Forgiven for the foreseeable future.</p><p>Learning of mysterious sightings of monsters across the globe Storm's security team, which consists of Psylocke, Domino, Pixie and Colossus began to investigate. After they secured a sample and used resources outside of the X-Men to analyze their findings, Storm discovered that these monsters were actually \"proto-mutants\", a genetic off-shoot of the mutant species that were slaughtered centuries before, and that an unknown enemy,David Michael Gray, was recreating them in his secret lab. Considering the magnitude of this discovery, Storm chose to keep her findings a secret from Cyclops, which brought her into conflict with some of her team members. The team managed to secure one of the proto-mutants and learned of Dr.Gray's location, but arrived too late to stop him from killing himself and all of the proto-mutants. Storm finally reported the team's failure to Cyclops, and after a heated conversation, Storm and the team went in pursuit of their sample, which had been stolen and placed into the hands of the Heavenly Path.</p><h3>Regenesis - Uncanny X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2087494\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/2087494-dont.jpg\" title=\"Violence\"><img id=\"2087494\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/2087494-dont_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Violence\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Violence</div></div></div></div><p>After the events of Schism split the X-Men into two separate factions, Storm, who explained to Cyclops that she was not fully in agreement with the direction he was taking the X-Men, was preparing to leave Utopia and join Wolverine's team of X-Men when Scott pleaded with her to stay. The team consisted of Magneto, Magik, Colossunaut, Namor, Danger and Emma Frost, he explained that he needed her to remain on Utopia to help him maintain control of what could be a potential disaster. Convinced by his compelling explanation, Storm agreed to remain on Utopia, and to be his second in command in the field. Cyclops met with Storm, Namor, Magneto, Colossus, Emma Frost, Hope, Danger and Magik and informs them that they will be the new Extinction team, the premiere and most powerful superhero team in the world. The team has taken on Sinister, the Phalanx and battled the \"Bad Apex\" in Tabula Rasa, where Storm ended the conflict by making the Apex see the error of his ways.</p><h3>Joining The Avengers</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2088817\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51192/2088817-tumblr_lushsa8hwo1qjfuc2o1_500.jpg\" title=\"Storm of the Mighty Avengers\"><img id=\"2088817\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51192/2088817-tumblr_lushsa8hwo1qjfuc2o1_500_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Storm of the Mighty Avengers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Storm of the Mighty Avengers</div></div></div></div><p>Looking to replenish the ranks of the Avengers, Captain America approached the Black Panther, who declined Steve\u2019s offer to return to the team, but recommended Storm for membership. Calling Storm to Avengers\u2019 Mansion, which was swarming with the media and public supporters of the heroes, Captain America asked Storm to join the team. The new Avengers team now consists of Storm, Captain America, Iron Man, Red Hulk, The Protector, Spider Woman, Hawkeye, Quake and Vision. The press conference was interrupted by a holographic image of Norman Osborne, who accused the Avengers of a litany of criminal offenses against him, and that H.A.M.M.E.R. would rise to challenge the Avengers. Captain America had the Avengers begin an immediate search for Osborne's whereabouts, teaming Storm up with Red Hulk, but all of them were surprised attacked and held captive by Osborne's H.A.M.M.E.R forces. They were eventually freed by Quake, and Storm and the Avengers defeated Osborne and shut down his bases of operation. The team also went on to defeat another faction of AIM.</p><p><strong>Avengers Vs X-Men</strong></p><p>With the anticipated return of the potentially world ending threat of the Phoenix Force, the Avengers organized and planned an attack to attempt to defeat the Phoenix and take it's intended host, Hope, into protective custody. Believing that the Phoenix Force could reboot the mutant species, Cyclop's has the X-Men fight the Avengers to keep Hope with them, putting Storm in a difficult position of having to choose sides. Though she sided with the X-Men at the start of the conflict, Storm found her husband, and asked that he help her find a way to end the conflict, but T'Challa refused, and Storm replied that his pigheaded stubborness is the reason the couple were in marriage counseling. As the conflict escalated, a small team of X-Men traveled to Wakanda in an effort to locate Hope, and encountered a team of Avengers, which included the Black Panther. Both he and Storm engaged each other in combat. It is revealed in Avengers vs. X-Men # 9 that the Black Panther , after a Phoenix empowered Namor attacked and almost destroyed Wakanda , has annulled his marriage to Storm. Despite this, Storm, still assisted the Avengers with rescuing their captured teammates, who were imprisoned by the Phoenix imbued Colossus and Magik.</p><h2>Powers</h2><h4>Weather Manipulation</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1904263\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/1904263-beauty.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1904263\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/1904263-beauty_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Multiple times over the years Storm has been called a \"sculptress\". This is one of many ways to describe her absolute mastery and dominion over the forces and elements of weather. In the blink of an eye Storm can alter her perception to see the world as constantly changing energy patterns. She becomes one with these energies. These patterns govern the weather and Storm can mold these patterns to her will, manifesting any meteorological tempest or weather effect with a thought. She has summoned blizzards, severe thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, as well as sleet and hail, and disbursed natural storms to create clear weather. Her range has been shown to be planetary but she can localize the weather effects to a specific area or target. Storm has also shown that she can channel these energies she manipulates through her body, which has allowed her to project weather-effects in a beam-like path from her hands, such as lightning, wind, and moisture. Due to her powers being tied to her emotions and because she is completely in-tune with the environment, she must keep a tight reign on her emotions to avoid them influencing the surrounding weather. Being acutely attuned with the biosphere of the planet Storm can sense various changes within the atmosphere and earth, including unnatural shifts in the air, movement within the earth, changes in the earth's electromagnetic field, or if submerged in water, shifts within the water's currents. She has sensed objects as small as a snowball being tossed her way or the Blackbird cutting across the atmosphere from thousands of miles away.</p><h4>Air and Pressure</h4><p>Storm's weather manipulation includes the ability to control and shape the very air, allowing Storm to produce various air effects and wind forces, including that which are not natural to the planet. While remaining within the natural parameters of the earth's atmosphere, she can generate wind speeds of varying intensities, ranging from a gentle breeze to tornado force, and produce specific effects with extreme precision. Her control over air is such that she can manipulate the air in a person's lungs. Another facet of her ability to control air is her excellent control over barometric pressure. Her control is such that can generate pressure sufficient to destroy or deflect solid objects, including blowing through the top of a mountain, causing buildings to explode, or manipulate the air pressure in the human body (such as the inner ear of the Black Panther). She has also generated a jovian pressure field, with air pressure greater than what is found on Jupiter. Her wind control also allows her to achieve flight.The upper limit of her flight speed is unknown, but, by manipulating or generating a jetstream, she has reached speeds that only jets can match. She has even been seen to intercept objects in reentry. Her powers protect her from the friction and cold that goes with traveling at these speeds. A new ability with her air control is the ability to pinpoint exactly where she is by sensing the shape of the air around the land of a structure.</p><h4>Lightning</h4><p>A powerful weapon in her arsenal is her ability to summon powerful bolts of lightning. Unlike normal bolts of lightning Storm can use them as concussive force, and can also control their intensity. She can also create other electrical atmospheric phenomena, including electromagnetic pulses, generated her own electrical, electromagnetic, ionization, and electrolysis fields, and can shape her lightning. Storm is also able to generate her own bioelectric lightning bolts from her body through her mutant metabolism.</p><h4>Moisture</h4><p>Storm can to manipulate the moisture in the atmosphere to an exceptional degree, generate rains of varying intensities, and allowing her to even create flash floods. She can also alter the state of moisture at a molecular level, changing it from a liquid to a gas (humidity) and to a solid (ice) instantly, and shape the form of moisture. Her control is refined enough that she was able to manipulate hydrogen atoms directly on one occasion.</p><p><strong>Temperature</strong></p><p>Storm possesses the ability to manipulate thermal energy and can increase or lower the atmospheric temperature, including extreme sub-zero temperatures that when combined with other elements, such as moisture or wind, have allowed her to generate a flash freeze effect. To what extent she can control temperature is unknown.</p><h4>Adaptation</h4><p>As Storm goes into different environments her powers adapt, including other planets and dimensions. When she is underwater she can manipulate the water's current similar to how she does with a wind current, to guide her as well as sense where things are even when there is no light. Her powers also shift and protect her from the crushing pressures and cold that go along to diving to extreme depths. The strength of the currents she can use isn\u2019t known however she once used them to safely lift the Blackbird. In space, she can use the nearest star's energy to manipulate the solar wind for flight or offense. Again, her powers protect her from the radiation that stars produce. Furthermore, because these energy patterns extend to outer space she can also summon bolts of lightning. When in space she needs no medium for her lightning to travel and the raw power of her bolts are significantly enhanced, and has summoned a bolt big enough to cover a space ship.</p><h4>Energy Sight</h4><p>With a blink, Storm can see the physical world around her as energy, including the human body's nervous system, which in turn allows her to counter all but the fastest attack. Added to her already formidable hand-to-hand abilities, this makes her a very tough opponent. Storm has also shown the ability to see in almost complete darkness.</p><h4>Resistance</h4><p>As it is easy to set the patterns in place to create violent storms it is more difficult for her to put them back. The time and effort mostly depends on how strong her body and will are at the time. When she along with the other X-Men crashed landed after an attack in the arctic, Storm tried to take control of a massive blizzard that spanned the entire continent, and because she had been severely weakened by the attack's effect on the planet, she was overpowered and her body went out of control causing her to overheat. She would have died if not for Professor X psionically bringing down her temperature.</p><p>For the most part Storm is immune to the weather. This immunity seems to be an unconscious power and is not fully under her control. She has had her lightning turned against her so she was struck down instead of her opponent.</p><h4>Resistance to Telepaths</h4><p>Powerful psychics like <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Xavier</a>, <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>, <a href=\"/rachel-grey/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a>, and <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> have found it difficult to contact or deeply probe Storm's mind if she doesn't allow it. Even at a young age she was capable of overcoming a full psychic attack from the Shadow King who is stated to rival or even surpass Xavier in power. During a final mission to destroy the Shadow King once and for all the Panther God hid inside her mind while she fought the Shadow King, a testament to her strength of will.</p><h4>Potential</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1775620\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41654/1775620-omegapotential.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1775620\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41654/1775620-omegapotential_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>It should be noted that Storm currently has the label of \"Omega Level Potential\" that has yet to be confirmed. As such, she may have a vast and ever evolving range and array to her mutant powers that is yet untapped.</p><h4>Skills</h4><p>Storm is a cunning and formidably gifted hand to hand combatant, trained by <a href=\"../../achmed-el-gibar/29-26034/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Achmed El Gibar</a> and the Black Panther in her youth, and extensively trained by her fellow X-Man Wolverine. She is a master thief, lock pick and escape artist, and she has the same degree of dexterity in her toes and mouth as she does with her hands. She is highly skilled with wielding knives, is experienced with a bo staff and has received training in swordfighting by the finest warriors in Wakanda. She is also an excellent marksman with a gun. She is very intelligent, a skilled and resourceful tactician, and possesses strong natural leadership skills, having lead the X-Men for years prior to and after her marriage to the Black Panther and her time as queen of Wakanda.</p><h4>Mystical Heritage</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1306673\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41654/1306673-marvel_tarot_page_013_artnet_dcp_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystic Potential.\"><img id=\"1306673\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/41654/1306673-marvel_tarot_page_013_artnet_dcp_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mystic Potential.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystic Potential.</div></div></div></div><p>Ororo is the descendant of a long line of African Priestesses and Sorceresses that had white hair, blue eyes, and strong magic potential. This line of women has been around since the dawn of Atlantis. While there have been many of them, the exact number of the women who possessed Ororo\u2019s unique features is still unknown. Due to the fact that Storm possesses the signature markings of a witch (blue eyes and white hair on her maternal side) you can assume has inherited latent magic abilities. To this day, Storm still has not shown the mystic aspects of what she could have inherited, but she does embrace the \u201cBright Lady\u201d, The Goddess of her ancestors who is also know as the <a href=\"../../vishanti/65-27218/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vishanti</a> member, <a href=\"../../oshtur/29-27220/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oshtur</a>, the source of her ancestors magic. Storm has used her latent ability as a priestess to successfully invoke her name. Out of the entire line of women, only 3 have been brought up. Ayesha, a Sorceress Supreme who was possibly the first to hold the High Priestess title, <a href=\"../../ashake/29-42895/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ashake</a>, a very talented Egyptian sorceress who appears to have also been High Priestess of her time, and another \u201cWind Rider\u201d who was confirmed by Andreas deRuyter and his father. Like her ancestor, Ayesha, Storm also possesses the title of this era\u2019s High Priestess.

When she had fallen victim to claustrophobic attacks in the past, she lost control of her powers. However, over time Storm has learned to somewhat manage her fear through sheer force of will and with mental exercises taught to her by Professor X.</p><h2>Status</h2><p><b>Known Relatives</b>: Ayesha, ancestor (deceased), <a href=\"/ashake/29-42895/\">Ashake</a>, ancestor (deceased), Mr. Munroe (paternal grandfather), Harriet Munroe (paternal grandmother), unidentified Kenyan maternal grandmother, David Munroe, father (deceased), <a href=\"../../ndare-munroe/29-42526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N\u2019dare Munroe</a>, mother (deceased), Vivian Munroe (deceased), Colonel Shetani (maternal uncle), David Evan Munroe Jr. (nephew), <a href=\"/black-panther/29-1477/\">T'Challa</a> aka Black Panther (Ex-husband), Ramonda (Ex-mother in law) <a href=\"/shuri/29-58997/\">Shuri</a> (Ex-sister in law), <a href=\"../../syan/29-59942/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'yan</a> (Ex-uncle in law)</p><p><b>Citizenship</b>: U.S.</p><p><b>Place of Birth</b>: New York City, New York</p><p><b>Marital Status</b>: Divorced</p><p><b>Occupation</b>: X-man, Adventurer; former Former Queen of Wakanda, gladiator, thief, tribal patron</p><h2><b>Characteristics</b></h2><p><b>Gender</b>: Female</p><p><b>Height</b>: 5'11\"</p><p><b>Weight</b>: 127 lbs.</p><p><b>Eyes</b>: Blue, glowing white when utilizing her powers.</p><p><b>Hair</b>: White</p><p><b>Alternate Realities</b></p><p><i>For more information, see:</i> <i>Marvel Multiverse</i>.

Her home continent, Africa was in turmoil following the rise of the mutant tyrant Apocalypse. Following this, Storm called herself the Windrider and declared a small section of Africa for herself to intended to keep it safe from the war brewing between mutants and humans. However, her plan backfired as the small section of Africa she was protecting actually made her and the people within stand out. Apocalypse took advantage of this and attacked the small nation and captured Storm to turn her into a Horseman. She was taken to Mr. Sinister and the Dark Beast where she was branded and made into a warrior for Apocalypse. It was here that Apocalypse gave her the codename 'Storm'.</p><p>While she was within Dark Beast's lab, she was subjected to torture and the Shadow King's mind- controlling telepathy. However, Storm was able to resist the Shadow King's mind control and managed to summon a large storm that wiped out all of the power within Apocalypse's lands. During the loss of power, Prelate Scott Summers found Storm and feeling sympathy for her helped her escape the labs. While Storm was heading back to Africa, she was confronted by Quicksilver whom she though was a spy for Apocalypse. As she was about to electrocute him with lightning, Quicksilver explained that he was actually a member of the X-Men and he earned her trust. Later on, Storm became romantically involved with Quicksilver.</p><p>Storm join the X-Men team and kept the code name Storm to remind her of what she had been through with Apocalypse. She was selected to join Quicksilver's X-Men team and was sent to help destroy the Sentinels that were created by the Human High Council in evacuating North America. While the team were within America, they were confronted by the Brotherhood and Abyss, who was a Horseman of Apocalypse, and their leader. Storm managed to defeat Abyss and his Brotherhood by luring Quicksilver out into the open.</p><p>Upon completing the evacuation, the X-Men team were sent back to their headquarters in Westchester. While there, they discovered that Apocalypse attacked their headquarters and captured Magneto, Charles and Bishop. Along with Quicksilver, Storm travelled to the Mandri Temple to rescue Bishop. They managed to find and rescue Bishop and they also managed to free Jamie Madrox, who was responsible for the creation of the Madri Cult. To stop the Madri surviving, Jamie shut down his own mind. Along with the rest of the X-Men team, Storm travelled to New York City to confront and defeat Apocalypse once and for all. They were successful in doing since then Storm and Quicksilver have developed their relationship and continue to fight for Magneto's vision of coexistence. After a decade of Apocalypse\u00b4s defeat, it is revealed that Storm became a loyal herald of the new Apocalypse (Weapon X).</p><p>(See: <a href=\"../../x-men-chronicles/49-18037/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men Chronicles</a> #1-2, <a href=\"../../x-men-alpha/49-18051/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men: Alpha</a>, <a href=\"../../astonishing-x-men-1995/49-5536/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Astonishing X-Men</a> #1, <a href=\"../../amazing-x-men/49-5535/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazing X-Men</a> #1-4, Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary One-Shot, Age of Apocalypse 10th Anniversary #1-6.

She did not meet Charles Xavier and later join the X-Men. Instead, while in her teens, she ventured to Africa, where her developing mutant powers emerged, and the legend of the Windrider grew across the continent. During this time, she met T'Challa. Storm used her powers to save T'Challa from a mutant attack on the young prince's kingdom of Wakanda. During that time the two fell in love, and T'Challa eventually proposed to her but Storm refused him. Over the subsequent years Storm used her powers for the good of Africa, using her powers to quell human-mutant conflicts throughout the continent and promote peace, and helped to end a civil war that erupted in Kenya. As a result, the Kenyan people embraced Storm as their queen. Storm played a pivotal role in Magneto's successful victory over the rest of Africa, though not Wakanda, and installed leadership in Africa, but allowed Storm to remain as queen of Kenya. Storm had helped to turn Africa into a world power, making Africa into the world's breadbasket. And, in addition to Africa's rising power, Storm's promotion of peaceful relations between humans and mutants gave Magneto great concern and brought her into conflict with him. To address this, Magneto instructed Quicksilver to court Storm, though the two of them developed genuine feelings for each other. However, due to Storm's distaste for Magneto's rule and that Pietro supported his father's philosophy, she did not pursue a relationship with him. Storm, as well as Sunfire, Namor and Blackbolt, rulers of their respective lands, was secretly working with T'Challa, whom Magneto had been trying to eliminate. After T'Challa killed the latest assassin, Sabretooth, Magneto sent in Apocalypse and his Horsemen to kill the Black Panther. As part of T'Challa's secret resistance, Storm takes down Apocalypse's airship and engaged Iceman, one of Apocalypse's Horsemen. A shot time later, at a large gathering to celebrate and honor the House of Magnus, Wanda changed the world back to normal but also eliminated 99% of the world's mutant population. Storm was one of the few remaining mutants who retained her powers.</p><h3>Earth-1298 (Mutant X)</h3><p>The Storm of the Earth-1298 reality (Mutant X), is known as Bloodstorm after being bitten by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dracula/29-7206/\">Dracula</a>. Before she was completely turned <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a> tried to slay her but fell as Storms first victim. She later joins up with fellow thief <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> possibly as her consort, and takes on a job to steal something from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>. It is here when she encounters <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Warren Worthington</a> once known as Angel, now resembling more of a winged demon calling himself The Fallen. He first taunts Ororo, before forcing her to expose herself as a vampire to Gambit when he attacks her. Fallen then attacks Gambit, fatally wounding him. Gambit begged Ororo to turn him.</p><p>At this time, she reluctantly turned Gambit into a vampire, because he was dying and he begged her to do it no matter what. He ended up hating her for what he becomes. They go their separate ways afterwards.</p><p>Ororo later joins up with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-six/65-45685/\">the Six</a> and takes on the name Bloodstorm. The team consist of a mock of the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> line-up, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Ice Man</a>, <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Brute</a>, and Fallen. She also keeps <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a> and Kitty, now calling herself Kathrine, as her consorts, and it is inferred that she fed on Forge instead of letting the thirst get the better of her.</p><h4>The Goblin Queen</h4><p>Mutant X was originally supposed to be a 13 issue mini-series in which Havok gets his own happy ending, in place of his brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>. Madelyne Pryor was possessed of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goblin-force/29-56308/\">Goblin Force</a>, which is depicted much in the tradition of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>. Once driven mad by it's power Madelyne Pryor becomes the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Goblin Queen</a>, first attacking the Six, and controling them. Bloodstorm was one of the first to be attacked, by her hordes of demons. When her castle was attacked Bloodstorm diverted the demons long enough for Kathrine and Forge to escape, though she fell to the Goblin Queen influence. By the end of the short lived inferno, Bloodstorm and the six are returned to normal and Havok along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scotty-summers/29-45590/\">Scotty</a> (His son) defeat the Goblin Queen. Madelyne however is lost as well.</p><h4>Gambit</h4><p>The Six find themselves in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-orleans/34-55684/\">New Orleans</a> where they encounter Gambit, who is now the leader of the thieves guild. Having owed Bloodstorm a favor for saving his life, he gives them sanctuary from the \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/friends-of-humanity/65-40563/\">Friends of Humanity</a>\" and anti-mutant terrorist group. Gambit however is betrayed by one of his own, and his wife is killed. He then leaves the guild and joins with the six, and he and Bloodstorm reconcile their differences. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> joins the Six and helps them defeat an evil <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Xavier</a> who has been possessed by his adversary the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a>.</p><h4>The Hunt for Dracula</h4><p>The Six were contacted by an organization known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-vault/34-43582/\">Vault</a> (a high security prison for super powered villains) A box containing Dracula had been stolen from the Vault by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a>. Bloodstorm sensing her maker volunteered to track it down and bring it back. In her pursuit Bloodstorm became more and more violent attacking people and beating answers out of them. Gambit who followed her tried to calm her, but failed. Bloodstorm eventually found her way to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morlock-tunnels/34-41282/\">Morlock tunnels</a> where she engaged the Marauders in battle, killing two of them, all the while growing more and more violent. Gambit eventually shows up and seeing that the closer she gets to the box the more evil she became, Gambit blew it down one of the drain pipes with a card. Bloodstorm immediately regained control over herself.</p><h4>A Cure</h4><p>While in the tunnels, Bloodstorm and Gambit are ambushed by the Morlocks who are all dressed like druids. Bloodstorm looses consciousness and Gambit disappears. When Bloodstorm awakes she meets <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagger/29-1935/\">Dagger</a>, the leader of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morlocks/65-3191/\">Morlocks</a>.

Before judgment can be passed, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a> realizes that Gambit's fate should be decided in a trial by combat. After the X-Man Gambit was revealed to have had a past connection with their enemy, Mister Sinister, involving the creation of the <a href=\"../../marauders/65-40480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marauders</a>, and their slaughter of the mutant Morlocks, Angel and Psylocke visited Papa Joe's Club to interrogate Gambit's adopted father, <a href=\"../../jean-luc-lebeau/29-7897/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean-Luc LeBeau</a>. Jean-Luc explained that he had no idea where Gambit had been, especially since the X-Men had dropped him in the Antarctic. The Angel and Psylocke then realized that Jean-Luc could only have known about the Antarctic had he spoken to Gambit. Jean-Luc begged for the X-Men to leave Gambit, as he could have died in the Antarctic, but the Angel and Psylocke claimed that it wasn't enough suffering for he had done to them.</p><p>Soon after they left the club, Angel and Psylocke were confronted by Wolverine, who reminded them that X-Men don't kill. Angel replied that it was funny coming from Wolverine and the X-Men also don't freelance to <a href=\"../../mr-sinister/29-3179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mister Sinister</a>. Wolverine agreed that Gambit screwed up big time, but Angel and Psylocke were not helping by going off on their own. He then warned that if the entire team didn't have a say in Gambit's judgment then he could not see the X-Men staying together as a team. Later, as Gambit awoke in <a href=\"../../paris/34-56052/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paris</a>, Jean-Luc called Gambit and warned him that he had just been visited by some of the X-Men. Back in New York, <a href=\"../../joseph/29-15063/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joseph</a> informed Rogue that the X-Men were about to have a meeting concerning the fate of Gambit. He noticed that Rogue was looking up the Antarctic in an atlas and reminded that she couldn't punish herself because of the crimes Gambit had committed. Their conversation was soon interrupted by the Beast, who wanted to know what was keeping them.</p><p>At the meeting, Storm informed the others that Wolverine, Angel, and Psylocke were towards Paris, where they believed Gambit was hiding. While the others discussed Gambit's fate, <a href=\"../../maggott/29-15072/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maggott</a>,</p><p><a href=\"../../marrow/29-13726/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marrow</a>, and Dr. Cecilia Reyes stood outside the door trying to listen in on the conversation. While Marrow argued with Maggott, Maggott's maggots ate their way through the door, revealing their presence outside. Storm invited the three newest X-Men into the room, where she announced that the X-Men had decided to send a team to Paris to pass final sentence on Gambit. In Paris, Gambit walked the streets, where he was attacked by Psylocke. As he tried to battle her, Angel arrived as well. The duo soon cornered Gambit, who explained that he had been cornered before and lived to tell about it. At that time, Storm and the other X-Men arrived on the scene to battle Gambit. Before Marrow could kill Gambit, Rogue knocked her away and Storm put a vote on the fate of Gambit. Bishop voted imprisonment, Marrow voted death, Iceman voted exile, but Wolverine explained to them that it was the Morlocks who suffered most from Gambit's actions. He suggested that Gambit's fate be decided by a trial by combat, as the Morlocks would have done. Marrow was the first to want to battle Wolverine, but the Angel announced that his hostility was more personal. Marrow then agreed to allow the Angel to battle Gambit. The two battled furiously until the Angel managed to pin Gambit to the ground, but he then let Gambit go free instead of killing him. The other X-Men prepared to let Gambit go, but Marrow killed Gambit anyway, unable to just let what she saw as a killer go free.</p><p>As Gambit died, he begged Rogue not to kiss him as that would allow her to absorb Gambit's feelings of guilt and cause her more emotional pain. Gambit dies, but not before urging the X-Men to come together and stop letting his own crime tear them apart.

See: <a href=\"../../ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimate X-Men</a> series. Storm was an illegal immigrant from Morocco who settled in Harlem New York. Using his Cerebro machine, Prof. X found Ororo in Athens, Texas where she'd been stealing cars for a living. When she took a 1978 Mustang for a joy ride, the police finally caught up with her. Pulling her over, Ororo used her powers to create a lightening storm so as to escape. Unfortunately, her control of her powers was limited, and she almost killed a group of children playing in a nearby playground; the police officers then subdued her. Per orders of Xavier, Jean Grey used her abilities to convince the Athens authorities that Ororo was actually an FBI agent and that she was sent to relieve them of the mutant. At first Ororo believed that Jean was another of Magneto's henchmen (apparently she had been contacted previously with an offer to join his Brotherhood), but Marvel Girl was there to offer her a place amongst Xavier's X-Men- a team of mutants gathered to halt the undeniable war that was brewing between humans and mutants whilst better mutants' standing in society.</p><p>Ororo joined the team not only to help further human/mutant relations, but also to gain control of her powers. Shortly after joining the X-Men, Ororo, who had chosen the codename <b>Storm</b> for herself, became interested in and began a relationship with fellow X-Man Henry \"Hank\" McCoy. She and Beast remained together for some time, until Beast was killed during a mission. Beast's untimely death led Storm to become belligerent, bitter, and angry; she even drastically changed her personal appearance, altering her style to a punk-inspired look. After Beast's death, Storm took much time to heal emotionally. Eventually, Storm began to flirt with fellow X-Man Wolverine. Initially, Wolverine rejected her, partially because of his feelings for Jean Grey and partially because he left the X-Men. When he left Xavier's school, Storm chose to follow him and the pair later returned to the X-Men.</p><h3><b><u>Earth-9602 (Amalgam Comic)</u></b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"610933\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/610933-09_wonder_woman_super.jpg\" title=\"Earth-9602 (Amalgam) Amazon\"><img id=\"610933\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/610933-09_wonder_woman_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-9602 (Amalgam) Amazon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-9602 (Amalgam) Amazon</div></div></div></div><p>Storm on Earth-9602 has been amalgamated with <a href=\"../../wonder-woman/29-2048/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wonder Woman</a> (from the DC Universe) and is known as <a href=\"../../amazon/29-47299/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amazon</a> or Wonder Woman, having won that title in a fair contest against <a href=\"../../diana/29-31592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Diana</a>.

Even though she's only 16 years old, she possesses considerable skill in weather manipulation. She had full control of her powers, and was able to summon powerful lightning, battering winds, torrential rain, and electromagnetic pulses capable of taking out multiple sentinels. She also possesses mystic knowledge and abilities. She especially took pride in her mystic heritage, by confidently stating that she was a witch who was raised with her uncle, a tenth generation shaman. A statement that shut down her teammates doubts that the amulets she created to bypass a fortitude spell would be unsuccessful. She is also the ruler of half of Africa. She is slain in Exiles #38, after being mortally wounded by an unknown attack. She died in Gambit's arms, while begging him not to let her die there, saying she wants a forest. Her teammates teleported just as her words were becoming more inaudible and slurred.

With the (questionable) death of his father's colleague, Dr. <a href=\"../../brian-xavier/29-13338/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brian Xavier</a>, Cain's father married Xavier's widow, Sharon. They moved into the Xavier Mansion (the later <a href=\"../../xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning)</a> in Westchester, New York. Cain was a bully to his stepbrother Charles, partly due to the fact that his father favoured him over Cain. Unknown to Cain, Charles was succeeding because of his mutant ability to read minds- including Cain's. When he found out Cain would never forgive Charles for this. During an argument with his father, Cain accidentally started a fire in his father's lab, the fire soon grew out of control and Kurt, once again showed his preference for Charles when he saved him first. After going back for Cain, he died of smoke inhalation.</p><h3>The Temple of Cyttorak</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"87508\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/87508-156546-crimson-gem-of-cytto_super.jpg\" title=\"Gem of Cyttorak\"><img id=\"87508\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/87508-156546-crimson-gem-of-cytto_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gem of Cyttorak\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gem of Cyttorak</div></div></div></div><p>Later, both Cain and Charles were drafted into the US army and were in the same unit during the Korean War. On a mission, they were in a fire fight and Cain deserted the unit, Charles went after him in the hopes of bringing him back before he got into trouble. Cain stumbled into a cave that had the lost <a href=\"../../temple-of-cyttorak/34-42362/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temple of Cyttorak</a> inside. He discovered the <a href=\"/crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/18-41533/\">Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a> on a plinth and when he touched it, magically appeared an inscription in English that read:<i>\"Whoever touches this gem shall be granted the power of the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak!

Charles and the world believed Cain to be dead, however, Cain was buried under the rubble of the immense mountain that covered the whole temple. The Juggernaut was not stopped by this and thanks to his ability to not eat or breath plus his recently acquired unlimited superhuman strength and durability he dug himself out of a trillion tons of rocks that fell on him. It took Juggernaut XX years (sliding timescale) to get out to the surface with nothing but thoughts of revenge against his step-brother on his mind. This event, undoubtedly, represents one of first daunting feats about Juggernaut's strength.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Juggernaut was created by writer <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a>, the same creative team responsible for the creation of the original X-men itself. In his first appearance in X-men #12 in 1965, he featured as an enemy to the main team.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Revenge</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"637203\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30665/637203-uxmen067_super.jpg\" title=\"Taking revenge on Charles\"><img id=\"637203\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30665/637203-uxmen067_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Taking revenge on Charles\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Taking revenge on Charles</div></div></div></div><p>Before Cain could claim the full power of Cyttorak and carry out his plan to return to the U.S. for revenge against Charles, he had to kill the previous Juggernaut and slaughter the village he was protecting a task Cain did with no second thoughts. By this time, Charles had a team of mutants, the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a>, that despite not being able to stop the Juggernaut they manage to remove his helmet in the first encounter, thus allowing Charles to subdue him with his mental powers. After the fight with the X-Men, Professor X locked Juggernaut in a special chamber of the mansion's sub-basement, where he was trying to take away his powers. During the experiment, Professor X was hit by some energy feedback and was knocked unconscious, which also transferred some of his mental powers to Juggernaut. The X-Men then contacted <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a>, since Juggernaut's origin was magical in origin, and he told them to go to Cyttorak temple since the apparent prototype <a href=\"../../crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/18-41533/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a> was there. <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a> and <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey</a> went into the actual Crimson Cosmos to retrieve it. The second gem succeeded in waking up Professor X, and when Juggernaut touched the second gem it sent him to the Crimson Cosmos. Xavier didn't want Cain to suffer such a fate though, and so built a machine that would slowly bring Cain back to Earth. By the time he had come back to Earth, Xavier was apparently dead (it was actually the mutant Changeling), and Juggernaut tried to beat the truth out of the X-Men as to where his brother's whereabouts were, suspecting a trap. However, the machine's effect wore off and Cain went back to the Crimson Cosmos again.</p><h3>Trapped in a Dimension</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2406739\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/118368/2406739-hero_envy_hulk_vs_juggernaut4a.jpg\" title=\"Hulk vs Juggernaut\"><img id=\"2406739\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/118368/2406739-hero_envy_hulk_vs_juggernaut4a_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hulk vs Juggernaut\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hulk vs Juggernaut</div></div></div></div><p>While in the Crimson Cosmos, Juggernaut managed to pick up some magical skills. <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a> ended up saving him when he needed his help to defeat <a href=\"../../nightmare/29-2646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightmare</a>, but Juggernaut accidentally freed <a href=\"../../eternity/29-11332/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eternity</a>, who then banished him to yet another dimension, called Oblivion. In Oblivion, time moved faster than normal, making people age quicker there, the only antidote to which is pure hatred which Cain had plenty. Juggernaut managed to cross over to Earth eventually, where he fought <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a>, but when Beast took off Juggernaut's helmet Juggernaut began to fear being defeated more than his hatred. He sudden aged rapidly, and so went back to Oblivion to speed up his remaining lifespan. The dimension itself had tired of Juggernaut, and so offered to him that if he gave up the magic skills he had learned in the Crimson Cosmos, he could be sent back to Earth. Naturally Juggernaut agreed, and materialized right in the middle of a fight between the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a> and the U.S. Army. The two teamed up, but when Hulk saw Juggernaut endangering innocent lives, he fought against him. Hulk threw juggernaut in a mountain during the battle, and the match finally ended when the X-Men arrived and Professor X used his powers on Juggernaut, who had lost his helmet during the fight.</p><h3>Black Tom</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134781\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy_super.jpg\" title=\"A dark old friend\"><img id=\"134781\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/134781-93239-black-tom-cassidy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"A dark old friend\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A dark old friend</div></div></div></div><p>Whilst in prison, Juggernaut befriended fellow cell mate <a href=\"../../black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, as both had a member of the X-Men who was family and they both hated. The two were freed from jail by Eric the Red, and they set up something of a base in Cassidy Keep. <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a> and the X-Men went to Cassidy Keep for a holiday shortly afterwards, and were easily beaten by Juggernaut and Black Tom. Eventually the fight went to the top of the keep, where Banshee managed to beat Black Tom by throwing him off the battlements. Juggernaut ignored the X-Men as he lept into the water to save his friend. Juggernaut did succeed in saving Tom, and the two returned to attacking the X-Men shortly afterwards.</p><p>The duo decided to hire Arcade to take down the X-Men, despite Juggernaut being against it, but Arcade didn't do any better than they did. After that they planned to rob a mint with the help of Black Tom's niece Siryn, but Siryn registered on <a href=\"../../cerebro/18-15073/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cerebro</a> which alerted the X-Men. What's more, they had to fight local hero Spider-Woman as well. Juggernaut and Black Tom agreed that if they ever wanted to defeat the X-Men they'd need another ally, and decided on Madame Web since she could predict their opponent's moves. Juggernaut went after <a href=\"../../madame-web/29-10670/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Web</a>, but when he pulled her out of her life-supporting chair in his eagerness, she almost died. <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a> managed to defeat Juggernaut by luring him into some wet cement, which he sunk through to the bottom. It took Juggernaut six months to break out of the cement, which he did by flexing and relaxing his muscles.</p><h3>Back in Town</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1255531\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33809/1255531-uxm183pg19_super.jpg\" title=\"Colossus was knocked out!!\"><img id=\"1255531\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33809/1255531-uxm183pg19_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Colossus was knocked out!!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Colossus was knocked out!!</div></div></div></div><p>The first thing Juggernaut did once he was out of the cement was enter his favourite bar for a drink. Whilst he did so, a dark-haired woman approached him and started flirting heavily with him. Juggernaut was unaware that this woman was the immortal <a href=\"../../selene/29-2176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selene</a>, who was planning to drain Juggernaut's energy as her next victim. Before she could complete her plan, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, who was coincidentally in the same bar, accidentally spilled his drink over Juggernaut. Juggernaut and Colossus got into a fight, with Juggernaut easily being the victor. When he saw the rest of the X-Men though, he gave them some money to cover the damages then left..</p><p>For Black Tom's birthday, Juggernaut gave him the <a href=\"../../crimson-gem-of-cyttorak/18-41533/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crimson Gem of Cyttorak</a> which had originally granted him his powers. When Tom touched the gift he transformed into a second Juggernaut, although both him and Cain had only half the power Cain had when he was the only Juggernaut. Cain and Tom had a short fight which was soon interrupted by <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a> and the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a>; they managed to defeat the Juggernauts by having <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogue</a> drain Tom's powers, which then went to Cain when he touched the Crimson Gem a second time. Juggernaut escaped with Tom and in case of someone else draining his power by touching the Gem, Juggernaut threw it into space so that no one could get it.</p><p>While perusing a scheme in Scotland with Black Tom Cain came across <a href=\"../../dazzler/29-1498/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dazzler</a> who wanting to prove herself took Juggernaut on thinking him another 'strong guy'. Cain didn't want the fight as he was a fan of Dazzler - having brought all her albums and even seen her live; however Alison continued to attack although nothing she did had any effect on Juggernaut and she passed out from exertion. Cain thought he had killed her and gave her a decent burial - which the X-Men had do dig her out from as she was only unconscious.</p><h3>Joining the X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"305694\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut_super.jpg\" title=\"As an X-Man\"><img id=\"305694\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14360/305694-198244-juggernaut_medium.jpg\" alt=\"As an X-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">As an X-Man</div></div></div></div><p>Cain's rebellion against <a href=\"../../cyttorak/29-24949/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyttorak</a> had serious consequences for Cain as began to lose the mystical energies that flowed through him. Cain behaviour began to change drastically, perhaps because those energies were evil they where influencing his behaviour as the Juggernaut. With that influence gone, Cain became noticeably different. When Black Tom had a secondary mutation into a plant being Cain called the X-Men to help when his friend attacked him. Not only that but he actually was willing to let himself drown because Tom had rejected him. Cain was saved by <a href=\"../../sammy/29-4572/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sammy aka Squidboy</a> a recent recruit to the school. Cain decided to look at his life and in the process, he reconciled with his step-brother. Charles and Cain discussed their shared history; Cain was a constant victim of his father's temper and hated Charles for not using his power to stop him, but unknown to Cain was that Charles was also a victim and didn't use his powers because he was scared to.</p><p>Cain officially joined the X-Men in Havok's team. While at the Xavier mansion, almost none of the X-Men wanted Cain there and some even tried to force him out, however Cain stayed and partly due to the strong friendship with Sammy. Knowing Sammy's family issues, Cain commented that he saw himself when he looked at Sammy. Their friendship was such that when Sammy was forced home by his family Cain flew to Canada to check on him even getting into a flight with Alpha Flight.</p><p>Cain was arrested and She-Hulk came north to represent him which after Cain stopped a prison break turned into a romance and one night stand. Cain was freed and ordered to do community service and counseling to deal with his abusive childhood.</p><p>Cain would apparently betray the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> by joining <a href=\"../../black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>'s new <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants</a>, but he was only spying on them with the intent to warn the X-Men. Sammy, not aware of what Juggernaut was doing, stumbled upon a group meeting and was devastated that Cain would betray everyone. Black Tom Cassidy killed Sammy before Cain could stop him, which caused Cain to go into a murderous rampage towards his former friend, which turned into a massive attack and defence of the Mansion. Eventually the 2nd <a href=\"../../xorn/29-3183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xorn</a> would suck the Brotherhood into the black hole in his head. Cain willingly followed to protect <a href=\"../../nocturne/29-4565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nocturne</a> who had also been a spy in the Brotherhood.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1084646\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54474/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18_super.jpg\" title=\"Punching Charles\"><img id=\"1084646\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54474/1084646-x_men_legacy_219__zone_megan__pg18_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Punching Charles\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Punching Charles</div></div></div></div><p>Juggernaut held a bar hostage waiting for <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles Xavier</a> to meet him. Cain possibly killing a bar patron at random to get Charles to sit down. They have a brief discussion on the origin of the word \"Juggernaut\" and Charles tells Cain he knows hes channeling the full power of Cyttorak again but its not too late. Cain tells Charles that he is going to kill him so he does not live his life following Charles. Charles gives Cain a box that is to be opened after his death, which Juggernaut proceeds to bring about. After the murder Juggernaut goes on with his life as he always has; robbing banks, fighting the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-M</a> <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">en</a> etc. Until he decides to open the box and sees himself lying in bed sleeping. It was all an illusion. Xavier was in his head the entire time. He did this for the simple fact that he knew Cain would kill him if he appeared in person.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1516373\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33044/1516373-juggernaut14_super.jpg\" title=\"Hammer ride!\"><img id=\"1516373\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33044/1516373-juggernaut14_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hammer ride!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hammer ride!</div></div></div></div><p>During <a href=\"../../acts-of-vengeance/39-41931/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>Acts of Vengeance</i></a> Juggernaut was pitted against <a href=\"../../thor/29-2268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thor</a> by <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loki</a>.

In exchange for this Juggernaut and Black Tom helped her take over the World Trade Centre to hold the businessmen hostage.

Onslaught\u2019s massive psionic assault weakened Juggernaut's mind before hitting him, knocking Cain from Canada to the wilds to outside NYC just in one blow. Found by the X-Men Cain recovered in their infirmary. Once better he escaped but before he could tell the X-Men who Onslaught was he was teleported into a side realm. He would have reminded there but a rift in the <a href=\"../../malibu/57-447/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malibu</a> universe happened and a hole opened into the realm Juggernaut was in. The people who created it where sucked in and getting out caused a huge explosion in NYC destroying a good chunk of the city. Forming a unhappy team Juggernaut, <a href=\"../../amber-hunt/29-41848/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amber Hunt</a>, <a href=\"../../shuriken/29-42641/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shuriken</a>, <a href=\"../../strike/29-42642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strike</a>, Siena Blaze and Reaper called themselves the <a href=\"../../exiles/49-5137/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exiles</a> and faced off against an Alien army. Cain and Amber formed a romantic relationship and Cain actually considered going straight to stay with her. Before he could make firm plans however he was returned to the 616 universe.</p><p>Once back on Earth Cain headed for Xavier's where he went before Jean Grey helmet-less to prove he wanted her to sort out his jumbled memories of who Onslaught was. Using the mysterious Z'Nok chamber Jean made the discovery that Onslaught was Charles Xavier and told Cain to run. Before he could Onslaught discovered Juggernaut and stated him can not kill him because he is indestructible, as long as it stays bound and protected by the unlimited power of the mystical energy of Cyttorak. However, Onslaught handled Cain\u2019s magic links with Cyttorak to restrict his powers only by locking him inside the Gem. Onslaught created a massive psionic display where he appears ripping the Gem of Cyttorak from Cain's chest.</p><p>Cain stripped of his powers into crimson cosmos would become the perfect sacrifice and it would lead to change the release of the most destructive and evil side of Cyttorak on the Earth again. However, a sorcerer called Gomurr entered the unattended Gem and attempted to take its powers for himself but was opposed by Juggernaut and a demoness called Spite the sister of D\u2019Spayre. Ultimately Cain got out and laid low in Sirocco Sprawl, New Mexico where Spite and D\u2019Spayre again attempted to involve him in their sibling rivalry, but Cain drove them off and saved the town who declared Juggernaut their savior.</p><p>Some millennium ago eight God like beings including Cyttorak decided to each make a totem of their power and the first Human who touched it would become their avatar - an Exemplar of their power. Cyttorak's was the Gem Cain had touched making him the Exemplar of Physical Strength. The last totem was activated stating the Octessence where the Eight Exemplar's would battle until only one remained. The Exemplar's would each lead one eighth of the worlds population into battle after removing all will power from Humanity with a machine at the North Pole. Cain however objected to this plan and given he'd had decades as Juggernaut to resist his Patron threw off Cyttorak's influence and smashed the machine. The other Exemplar's had decided to punish Cain for his disobedience, but the Avengers intervened and with Juggernaut's help stopped them partly by force and partly by encouraging disagreements between the Exemplars who split and left. Juggernaut then quietly surrendered to the Avengers.</p><p>Cain got out of doing time by agreeing to become a headhunter for the Commission on Superhuman Activity and in exchange, was pardoned from his past crimes. Cain's handler was <a href=\"../../sachi-yama/29-48553/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sachi Yama</a> who in one <a href=\"../../mc2/12-43721/\" rel=\"nofollow\">universe</a> would go on to be the mother of Juggernaut's son, however in 616 Cain tricked the Government and left their service to return to mercenary work with Black Tom.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1214827\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54474/1214827-new_excalibur_11_00_super.jpg\" title=\"With the Excalibur team\"><img id=\"1214827\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54474/1214827-new_excalibur_11_00_medium.jpg\" alt=\"With the Excalibur team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">With the Excalibur team</div></div></div></div><p>Cain and Nocturne turned up in Britain during the <a href=\"../../house-of-m/39-40991/\" rel=\"nofollow\">House of M</a> event, however they stayed and helped form a new <a href=\"../../excalibur/65-14864/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Excalibur</a> team having developed a strong bond together. Nocturne had displayed some romantic feelings for Cain, especially during her stroke recovery, but Cain was not sure how to return them, especially as Cain was suffering from depression due to his loss of power. The situation was brought home when the <a href=\"../../wrecking-crew/65-18519/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wrecking Crew</a> beat him up in London laughing at him having become a joke and the other villains had taken him off their mobile phone and Christmas card lists. Wrecker told him he had abandoned his 'brother' Black Tom.</p><p>The Crew's words to him led Cain to consider his weakened state, which made Cain to travel to Korea and the Temple of Cyttorak. In doing so, Cain discovered that it was never Cyttorak's intention to use Cain as his avatar, but the true target was his brother Charles Xavier. Cain was upset about the fact that it was meant for Charles and not him, especially as it seemed Cyttorak thought him a failure. He asked Cyttorak why he wanted Cain back as was told that being Juggernaut was the one thing Cain has not failed at. Being the Avatar of Strength the destruction he spread was exactly what Cyttorak wanted. Cain fought another possible Juggernaut to for the right to claim the Gem, as to become the Juggernaut, one has to kill the current holder of the power. Only when one was dead could one of them take the Gem and the power. <a href=\"../../excalibur/65-14864/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Excalibur</a> came to take him home before he landed the killing blow and Cyttorak explained the history of his Avatar's and what Cain had done to claim his power; the team walked out in disgust- although Nocturne seemed more interested in what they had going, but this moment seemed to be their split. Cain told Excalibur he had not taken the Gem, but it was shown he had it secretly in his possession. <a href=\"../../pete-wisdom/29-14819/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pete Wisdom</a> told Cain he was still on the team as what he said went and he understood what it was like to have horrible things in one's past.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2405458\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/118368/2405458-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0023_24.jpg\" title=\"Juggernaut Vs Hulk\"><img id=\"2405458\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/118368/2405458-wwh_xmen_3_dcp_0023_24_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Juggernaut Vs Hulk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Juggernaut Vs Hulk</div></div></div></div><p>Cain might had built a life with Nocturne and Excalibur but during Hulk's return to Earth ( <a href=\"../../world-war-hulk-x-men/49-18786/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World War Hulk</a>) the green giant attacked the X Mansion. Excalibur where too far away to help. However Cain pulled out the Gem and agreed to do Cyttorak's bidding again if he will get Cain to the Hulk. Cyttorak transports Cain to the Mansion where he is swiftly and easily beaten by <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a> who claims Cain is 'wimpier' than he last saw him. Confused as to why he did not have his powers Cyttorak informed Cain that Cain himself was restricting the power flow by lying to himself about why he wanted it - he didn't want it to save his brother as he said- he wanted it for himself and to prove he was not a wimp and loser. After he accepts this and what taking back Cyttorak's power and status means he engaged the Hulk again. This time, Cain fully powered, and was able to put up a better fight. They started to punch each other a lot until finally, shoulder to shoulder, their hands locked to push each other. Hulk tells juggernaut that he doesn't have time to continue this fight because he had other plans, so hulk outsmarted Cain and released his hold when <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charles Xavier</a> warned Cain that if he kept fighting against the Hulk the whole mansion would collapse; this caused Juggernaut to move forward and forward with out being able to stop himself and finely crashed into a lake nearby, and hulk then sorted things out with Charles and left the mansion so he could continue his mission,</p><p>After the battle Charles thanked his step-brother for coming to the rescue. Juggernaut told him it was not for him and gave him a message that the others should not seek him out as they would not like what they found. During the <a href=\"../../manifest-destiny/39-55673/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manifest Destiny</a> storyline, Juggernaut was in a bar contemplating on whether to be a good guy or a bad guy while asking those in the bar their advice. After the local police fired on him without stopped to see who he was first Juggernaut thrashed them and decided that he was \"good with the bad\".</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1068750\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33809/1068750-incredible_hulk__602_01_super.jpg\" title=\"Juggernaut VS Skaar\"><img id=\"1068750\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33809/1068750-incredible_hulk__602_01_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Juggernaut VS Skaar\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Juggernaut VS Skaar</div></div></div></div><p>When Banner wanted <a href=\"../../skaar/29-48518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skaar</a> to train for the battle with Hulk, he used a satellite in order to destroy Juggernaut's home in Arizona. That made Juggernaut angry so he tracked Banner and Skaar immediately. When they met each other Banner explained why he did it, but Skaar didn't want to fight Cain, so he left Banner for him to play with. Juggernaut punched Banner so hard that he caused giant earthquakes nearby, and despite of the fact Banner had his Bannertech shield up, he still felt the pain of those tremendous blows. Then Skaar interrupted their fight and the battle between him and Juggernaut began. Skaar made one successful hit, but the rest of the battle was definitely not in his favor, since Skaar had no experience of fighting someone like Cain ,since juggernaut was unstoppable Skaar reverted back to his child form Using his <a href=\"../../old-power/12-55874/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Old Power</a> (to trick juggernaut) , which temporarily stopped Cain from landing hits on him, then with Juggernaut distracted by Banner, he didn't notice that Skaar changed back to his Hulk form. Skaar ran and smacked Juggernaut high into the air by using his Old Power. They continued to battle in the sky, until they landed in a large chasm with lava flowing deep in the bottom. Skaar made Juggernaut think that they're on the same side, as both of them hated Banner. They teamed up and were flying on a giant rock out of the chasm, but in the end Skaar tricked Juggernaut again and pushed him from behind, so Juggernaut fell from the rock and while he was landing, Skaar used Old Power to punch Juggernaut into orbit, removing him from the battlefield.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1210374\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1210374-captain_juggernaut001_super.jpg\" title=\"As Captain Universe\"><img id=\"1210374\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1210374-captain_juggernaut001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"As Captain Universe\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">As Captain Universe</div></div></div></div><p>Juggernaut was shown to have a serious encounter with new <a href=\"../../captain-universe/29-27193/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Universe</a> and he also met his old foe, Spider-man, again. After landing into the one of Manhattan's parks, he was found by Spider-man and then by police,who delivered him into the Inwood Armoury in the Upper Manhattan. Spider-man found Juggernaut and asked him who did it to him. Juggernaut described the appearance of the attacker, when suddenly the one they were talking about appeared - Captain Universe; his current host an unknown. He attacked Spider-man and then threw the platform with Juggernaut into the Jersey Palisades. While Spider-man took care of Captain Universe, Juggernaut woke up and took out two policemen nearby. Noticing that his helmet was destroyed, he created another by using the Crimson Magic. He found Spider-man blinded, and despite Spider-man's worst expectations, he didn't kill him but freed him. Suddenly, Captain Universe appeared again, wanting the revenge on the Juggernaut.</p><p>However, this time he was not so lucky as before and Juggernaut quickly handled him and was about to land a finishing blow. Spider-man said Juggernaut not kill Captain Universe, but the latter took advantage of Cain's distraction and teleported them both to an unearthly realm. There he reveals his story and true identity to Juggernaut. In fact, the host was an office worker, <a href=\"../../william-nguyen/29-70676/\" rel=\"nofollow\">William Nguyen</a>, whose life was ruined when Spider-man and Juggernaut busted through the building where he worked. William was chosen by <a href=\"/uni-power/12-44362/\">En igma Force</a> in order to collect all wrongs in the world, so he decided to start with Juggernaut. He knew that once the Juggernaut starts moving, he cannot be stopped , so he decided to take Juggernaut by surprise, grabbing him from behind and flying with him in the orbit. He tried to use a mental assault on Juggernaut, but his helmet was an impediment. So William blew it up and threw him back to Earth. After telling this story, Juggernaut wanted to fight Captain Universe again, now in a fair fight. William teleported them back to Earth. While his original purpose was to repair tectonic plates that were damaged by Juggernaut, he decided to kill Juggernaut first, leading to the disappointment of Enigma Force. The repair must have been done, and for that Captain Universe is needed. Absolutely surprisingly, Juggernaut became the new Captain Universe. Enigma Force chose him to repair the damage he did long time ago.</p><p>After fulfilling his purpose, Enigma Force left the Juggernaut and disappeared. So did the Juggernaut, after apologising Nguyen for that accident.</p><p>Despite Luke Cage's apprehensions, the executives of the Thunderbolt initiative decided it would be an asset to their team to have Juggernaut be a part of it. Marko is eager to join and escape his cell on The Raft, but has thus far shown to be insubordinate to Cage, Songbird, and the other staffers of the team. It has also been pointed out several times that Juggernaut's powers are greatly diminished, being able</p><p>to be controlled by nanites and shown to be extremely vulnerable to physical attacks, all this because his links with Cyttorak\u2019s energies were disrupted after Marko took possession of the <a href=\"../../uni-power/12-44362/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uni-Power</a>\u2019s energies temporarily when he became the Captain Universe's host.

During his imprisonment on the <a href=\"/the-raft/34-50736/\">Raft</a>, an object crashes from the sky and smashes into the prison. Juggernaut recovers from the impact and upon 'hearing' the hammer, he grasps it. The hammer transforms him into one of <a href=\"/the-worthy/65-58278/\">The Worthy</a>, and he becomes Kuurth - Breaker of Stone. With a single massive hammer strike, the newly empowered Juggernaut smashes the entire prison seemingly in half.</p><p>With Kuurth now in complete control of Cain's body and mind, he flew away from The Raft and began tearing his way across the middle United States, specifically Missouri. Upon reaching the town of Salem, he briefly found himself in conflict with Speedball and was thrown out of town by his kinetic abilities. However, this did nothing to harm Kuurth, only enrage him to the point that he split Salem in half but not in the same way he had with The Raft.</p><p>Kuurth moved on after his short conflict with Speedball and ran into Cain Marko's old teammates, The Thunderbolts, out in Chicago before moving onto the city of Las Vegas, Nevada where the only opponents standing between him and the total annihilation of the city were The Heavy Hitters, the ex-Fifty State Initiative team that once represented Nevada.

Similarly, due to the mystical nature of his powers granted by an external source of magic as the Gem of Cyttorak, Juggernaut can increase his physical strength to immeasurable levels with a simple thought when he needs it. Juggernaut has been able to defeat powerhouses such as <a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thing</a>, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> , among numerous others.</p><h3>Invulnerability</h3><p>A invisible force field surrounding Juggernaut's body allows Juggernaut to be completely immune to any purely physical attack no matter its magnitude or intensity.</p><h3>Healing Factor</h3><p>Juggernaut can be harmed by mystical weapons, cosmic levelers(such as the Silver Surfer), and extra dimensional beings. If harmed, the gem powering him will regenerate any and all wounds instantly without scarring. He has been reduced to as skeleton at one point and completely regenerated within seconds. As long as their is a single molecule of Cain's being, he is unable to die.</p><h3>Self Sustenance</h3><p>The mystical energies of the gem flowing through Cain's veins completely sustain him, meaning the Juggernaut can survive indefinitely without food, water, or air. In addition, Juggernaut is unable to tire to matter the physical exertion his body puts out.</p><h3>Unstoppable Momentum</h3><p>Once juggernaut gains momentum, nothing can stop him.

Her parents married far too early in their relationship. In an attempt to fix their decaying relationship, Priscilla got pregnant. Nine months later she birthed a baby girl that she named Anna-Marie. Unfortunately the young couple was whisked into a nature-loving commune where they joined in an insane plan to reach \u201cthe Far Banks,\u201d a dreamland from Native American mythology, where the rules of the physical world no longer applied. The commune hired a shaman to take them to the Far Banks, but something went horribly wrong during the ceremony. Owen had planned to sacrifice Priscilla to the spirits of the Far Banks, but she took control of them and closed the mystical place behind her as she vanished. Grief stricken, Owen pleaded with Priscilla\u2019s sister <a href=\"../../aunt-carrie/29-67310/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carrie</a> to aid him in raising his daughter. Anna-Marie, who had been nicknamed Rogue, didn\u2019t have a pleasant childhood with her aunt as Carrie used a rough education on her in an attempt to prevent her from making the same mistakes her mother made. Though Anna did not go entirely without love, her beauty is well recognized by the boys of her town. There is one boy in particular she fell in love with, his name was <a href=\"../../cody-robbins/29-14804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cody Robbins</a>.\nShe was with him one night, under a full moon, during their first kiss, when she developed her powers, leaving her first love in a lifelong coma.

She was seen and chased by a small part of the mob while looking at her followers; Anna ran into a stranger and fell unconscious. She never saw how, but she was rescued by the time-traveling <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cable</a>. He quickly dealt with the mutant haters and left before Anna awoke.

It was planned that her first appearance would be in the <i>Ms Marvel</i> #25 comic book in 1979. This was changed however, when this book was canceled which left her original introduction story unpublished for over a decade. Finally, in 1981, Rogue made her first appearance in the <a href=\"/avengers-annual/49-2350/\"><i>Avengers Annual</i></a> #10 in 1981 and made her first X-Men appearance in <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\"><i>Uncanny X-Men</i></a> #158.</p><p>Rogue's real name and history were not revealed until twenty years after her first introduction when <a href=\"/robert-rodi/26-48654/\">Robert Rodi</a> created the back story in her solo series entitled <a href=\"/rogue/49-19612/\"><i>Rogue</i></a> in 2004.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2471818\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79830/2471818-rogue_8.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2471818\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79830/2471818-rogue_8_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Rogue is a long-time, central character in the X-Men world within the Marvel Universe. Her beginnings were as a simple villain being led on by Mystique. But her battle with Carol Danvers and the absorption of her powers of strength and flight stuck and became definitive of her for many years. The encounter with Carol Danvers also had the side-effect of introducing Rogue to the X-Men, whose line-up she would never leave again. The Ms. Marvel powerset stuck with her, even after a passage through the <a href=\"/siege-perilous/18-40957/\">Siege Perilous</a>, but finally lost these abilities after the <a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a> story arc. Rogue was one of the few X-Men characters whose real name had never been revealed until a long time after their first appearance (see also <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>). In the X-Men films, Rogue's real name is Marie. In the comics, however she called herself Anna Raven when her powers were deactivated. Her real name was finally revealed in her solo series \"Going Rogue\" in flashbacks of her Aunt Carrie and her mother, who called her Anna Marie.</p><p>Most recently, Rogue has gained more control over her abilities than she has ever had before, and has been featured in a more solo role in the <a href=\"/x-men-legacy/49-20691/\">X-Men Legacy</a> series.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2078357\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/2078357-679726_rogue03.jpg\" title=\"Rogue's first meeting with her foster mother, Mystique\"><img id=\"2078357\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/2078357-679726_rogue03_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Rogue's first meeting with her foster mother, Mystique\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rogue's first meeting with her foster mother, Mystique</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique took Anna home with her where she introduced the teenager to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destiny/29-3557/\">Irene Adler</a> ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destiny/29-3557/\">Destiny</a>), Raven\u2019s lover. In a few short weeks Anna grew to trust the two women, and she would expose herself as a mutant; what was most shocking to her was that her foster mothers themselves were also mutants. With this information she grew to further trust them, and even love them. It was with them she met her closest friend, another mutant girl her age who called herself <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blindspot/29-14588/\">Blindspot</a>, her powers allowed her to erase anyone\u2019s memories by touching them. Her powers seemed to counteract Anna\u2019s mutation and they were able to safely touch each other, which pleased Anna to no end because this made her feel normal.She felt pressured by Mystique to join her terrorist group, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, but Anna wanted a normal life. When Anna was dared to kiss a boy named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freddy/29-70856/\">Freddy</a>, her powers kicked in and she drained him too. After that she would never speak to him again, and with no sign of a normal life ever being possible she joined Mystique and The Brotherhood. Anna frequently tested her limits. <a href=\"/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> often needed to keep her in line, as Anna took her powers too lightly and enjoyed using her abilities for fun. Anna also dyed her naturally white streak brown, only to replace it with two white streaks on her temples, apparently in an attempt to look older.</p><p>During their final mission together, they were hired to travel to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a> and break into the house of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lord-dark-wind/29-19384/\">Lord Dark Wind</a>, the father of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-deathstrike/29-8470/\">Lady Deathstrike</a>. They were to steal his plans for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adamantium/18-40759/\">adamantium</a> bonding process. In order to succeed, they had to team-up with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a>. During the mission, Sunfire was knocked out and Anna took his flame powers. She loved flying and wanted to keep these abilities, but they quickly faded, however not before Anna destroyed major parts of Dark Wind\u2019s estate. Although they hadn\u2019t accomplished their actual mission, the Brotherhood still classified this as a victory, and to celebrate, Blindspot took a picture of Mystique, Anna and Sunfire with Dark Wind\u2019s burning property in the background. Back home, though, Mystique had enough of Blindspot and exiled her from the group. In order to protect herself, Blindspot erased Mystique\u2019s, Anna\u2019s, and everyone else\u2019s memory of her to move on without being recognized. Life went on for Rogue, Mystique and Destiny as if nothing had happened. In time, Destiny received precognitive visions that warned her about the Avenger known as Ms. Marvel costing Rogue her soul one day.</p><p>Destiny discussed this with Mystique, who then vowed to not allow it, even if it would kill her. Anna, only hearing the last part, decided she would hunt down Ms. Marvel herself in order to protect her mother. However, Ms. Marvel had vanished from Earth and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>\u2018 active roster, having been taken to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> by Marcus, was nowhere to be found. When Mystique\u2019s Brotherhood of Evil Mutants made their public debut, Destiny had convinced Mystique to keep Rogue back from the mission as a failsafe. Destiny proved to be correct, for all of the Brotherhood, except Mystique who was captured in their first mission by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>. During this incident Anna learned that Carol had returned and was now living in San Francisco. Unaware that this would cause the danger that Destiny had predicted, she tracked down and battled Ms. Marvel on the plane.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"679732\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/679732-rogue09.jpg\" title=\"Vs Ms. Marvel\"><img id=\"679732\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/679732-rogue09_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Vs Ms. Marvel\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vs Ms. Marvel</div></div></div></div><p>Carol resisted Anna\u2019s powers like nobody before and something went wrong. Anna found that, somehow, her metabolism had permanently retained Ms. Marvel's mind and powers. Fearing for her own sanity and identity, since she kept hearing Carol's voice in her head, Anna threw her body off the bridge, Hoping that her physical death would also kill the voice in her head. Unfortunately for Anna, she was rescued by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a>, who brought Carol to a hospital, where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a> could partially restore her memories. Under Mystique\u2019s guidance, Anna proceeded to attack the Avengers one by one, absorbing the powers of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, with Raven impersonating <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>, she tried to free the rest of the Brotherhood from prison. However, the remaining Avengers and Spider-Woman prevented the breakout. As most of her stolen powers were already fading, Anna escaped with Mystique to avoid being captured as well. Several weeks later, the X-Men sneaked into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pentagon/34-55834/\">Pentagon</a> with Carol to delete their data files. In one of the corridors, they ran into Anna, who was there thanks to Mystique's secret identity as a government agent, immediately,a fight started and Anna absorbed both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>\u2019s powers.</p><p>After regaining consciousness, Storm created an air vortex to carry Rogue away, as she did not want to endanger the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pentagon/34-55834/\">Pentagon</a> personnel by a fight. Soon, Mystique tried once more to release her teammates from prison. Anna and Mystique easily defeated the guards, but <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rom/29-2189/\">Rom</a> (the Spaceknight), discovered the breakout. He easily rendered the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blob/29-3182/\">Blob</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pyro/29-3554/\">Pyro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avalanche/29-3553/\">Avalanche</a> unconscious, because they fought unorganized Mystique angrily decided to leave them in prison for a while longer. Searching for new allies, Mystique, Destiny and Anna found <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hybrid/29-45621/\">Hybrid</a> (a half-human, half- <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dire-wraiths/65-14015/\">Dire Wraith</a>) and offered to team up with him against their common enemies, Rom and the X-Men. In combat with Rom, Rogue touched his Galadorian armor and absorbed some of his inherent nobility in the process. When Hybrid revealed his plans to turn the entire Earth, including mutants, into his slaves and cattle, the mutant trio opposed him before fleeing. While Rom battled Hybrid alone, Rogue showed the potential for goodness for the first time, as she went back against Mystique\u2019s orders, finding she could not bring herself to leave without helping the Spaceknight. Wanting revenge on the X-Men for having spoiled their plan to assassinate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Kelly</a>, Mystique and her partners assaulted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>.</p><p>During the fight, Rogue was supposed to absorb the knowledge of the X-Men\u2019s whereabouts from Angel\u2019s mind but she did not want to use her powers on him, as the wings were a physical mutation and Rogue feared what effect that would have on her. While distracted with their own problems, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a>, took Anna and Mystique by surprise with her light powers. Anna then developed a grudge against Dazzler, the woman who had everything that she wanted. Having been a fan of her music before, she now saw that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dazzler/29-1498/\">Alison Blaire</a> had also a controllable mutant power and a beautiful boyfriend. Slowly, the personality and memories that Anna had permanently absorbed from Ms. Marvel began to overpower Anna\u2018s mind, affecting her control and her sanity. Finally, after seeing that Mystique clearly couldn't aid her with these problems, she turned to Charles Xavier and the X-Men.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Becoming an X-Man: A Fresh Start</h3>Shortly after moving into the X-Men's headquarters, Anna changed her hair back to its original style with the single white streak, to reflect her inner change and to support the idea of a fresh start. Naturally, the X-Men were suspicious of the former enemy among their ranks, especially Wolverine, who was good friends with Carol. However, slowly but surely, Rogue gained the X-Men\u2019s trust, by risking her own life to save Wolverine\u2019s fianc\u00e9, <a href=\"../../mariko-yashida/29-3196/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mariko Yashida</a>. Naturally, Mystique noticed that Anna had left the house and, before long, she tried to get her daughter back. While the Brotherhood kept the rest of the X-Men busy, Mystique infiltrated the mansion and knocked out Xavier. Believing that he must have mentally controlled Anna to make her abandon the Brotherhood, but after Rogue stated that it was her own choice to join the X-Men, considering that Xavier might be her last chance to control her power, Mystique reluctantly agreed and left.<br /><br />Rogue found a message from Colonel Mike Rossi, asking for help. Rogue immediately went to help him and rescued him from the <a href=\"../../shield-helicarrier/18-40700/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD Heli-Carrier</a>. Without realizing it, she accessed memories and personality traits of Carol Danvers, even her voice and accent changed. She had stolen the very identity of Carol Danvers, everything that had made her the person she was, was forever lost to Carol and locked away in Rogue\u2019s head. After being framed for murder, the government planned to use a prototype power neutralizer on Rogue. Rogue was still struggling against the Ms. Marvel personality that was still inside her. Mystique learned of this in her guise as a governmental employee, and Destiny's prediction of the danger. They alerted Storm to Rogue\u2019s whereabouts and after she had found her, Storm and Rogue finally sorted out their differences and Ororo proved her trust by volunteering to let Rogue absorb her power.Rogue was tempted to permanently absorb the weather abilities but resisted, not wanting to betray the trust placed in her.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><a href=\"/mutant-massacre/39-41407/\">Mutant Massacre</a></h3>Suddenly <a href=\"../../henry-gyrich/29-9711/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Henry Gyrich</a> and his forces attacked and it became painfully clear that Mystique had not revealed the full extent of Destiny\u2019s vision. Whoever would come to Rogue\u2019s aid would have to take her place and it was now Storm who was hit by the power dampening blast meant for Rogue. With Storm incapable, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> became temporary leader of the team, and he tried to test Rogue for the seventh sense that Ms. Marvel had possessed. It seemed that she was only able to manifest this vague ability under great stress, and she had absolutely no interest to develop this ability any further. When attacked by <a href=\"../../nimrod/29-13314/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nimrod</a>, the X-Men were almost defeated. Buried under the rubble of a construction site, Rogue saw no other chance than to absorb the powers of her unconscious teammates all at once. The gamble worked, as Nimrod was confused by Rogue\u2019s use of multiple mutant signatures at once.</td></tr><tr><td>During the <a href=\"../../mutant-massacre/39-41407/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mutant Massacre</a>, history seemed to repeat itself. Rogue was temporarily rendered vulnerable by <a href=\"../../scrambler/29-9735/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scrambler\u2019s</a> power canceling effect, and as she was about to be hit with one of <a href=\"../../harpoon/29-9733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harpoon</a>\u2019s energy lances <a href=\"../../kitty-pryde/29-3548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitty Pryde</a> jumped in between, believing to phase both of them to safety. Yet, the energy spear interacted with Kitty\u2019s intangible form, leaving her stuck in phased state. Rogue was saved, but once again at the price of a teammate being harmed. Soon afterwards, Dazzler found herself attacked by the Marauders, and reluctantly joined the X-Men, as she, by herself provided a too easy target. To get into shape, <a href=\"../../dazzler/29-1498/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dazzler</a> excessively trained in the <a href=\"../../danger-room/34-41918/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danger Room</a> and Rogue was not too pleased when she learned that Alison was running simulations with Rogue as the villain.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Australian Outback</h3><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fall-of-the-mutants/39-41745/\">Fall of the Mutants</a>, the X-Men battled a mystical entity known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adversary/29-26995/\">Adversary</a>, who was bent on destroying and remaking the multiverse. In the final battle, the X-Men's physical and spiritual essences were used as fuel for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a>'s energy star, which closed the doorway to the Adversary\u2019s plane of existence and saved the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-multiverse/34-45892/\">multiverse</a>. They, in effect, died. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roma/29-14810/\">Roma</a>, a prisoner of the Adversary and guardian of the multiverse, used her powers to recreate the fallen X-Men from scratch, making her own minor alterations. Now invisible to cameras and all forms of detection equipment, the X-Men resettled to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/australia/34-55838/\">Australia</a>, claiming an abandoned ghost town in the Outback as their new base of operations.</p><p>The X-Men used their new status to attack anti-mutant threats around the world, which also brought them in conflict with the island nation of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>. Their own super powered agents, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/press-gang/65-56450/\">Press Gang</a>, captured Rogue and Wolverine and the unthinkable happened as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wipeout/29-28583/\">Wipeout</a> fully canceled their abilities. For the first time in years, Rogue was able to experience skin to skin contact, though it now happened against her will. Thanks to a special form of digitalized teleportation, Rogue arrived naked to the prison of Genosha, and the guards took a few liberties when they put her into a cell. Rogue completely withdrew into her subconscious. There, she found out that some psychic residue had remained of all people she had absorbed and now these phantoms tried to overwhelm her. As Anna was fighting for sanity and control within her mind, unexpected help was provided by the permanently absorbed personality of Carol Danvers. She was more than the psychic residue, in fact, she was as solid and real as Rogue. As Carol, with her spy training, was more suited for escaping from the prison without any superpowers, Rogue let Carol take over. From then on, Carol and Rogue agreed on a new modus operandi - the two personalities would actually share the body, with each having their times of dominance, or acting as back up when one was rendered unconscious. It also seemed that Carol had no trouble to keep the absorption power under control. While she was using the body, she touched <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a>'s bare skin without any effect. Evidently, Rogue\u2019s lack of control was strictly psychological in nature.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"259452\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9690/259452-187982-siege-perilous.jpg\" title=\"Siege Perilous\"><img id=\"259452\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9690/259452-187982-siege-perilous_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Siege Perilous\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Siege Perilous</div></div></div></div><p>During Inferno, the X-Men were demonically influenced and started to behave strangely. Rogue was scared by the experience, as it showed her what another presence in her mind could make her do. Afterwards she no longer allowed the Ms. Marvel persona to surface, prompting Carol to take control by force. When the X-women went shopping in a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/california/34-55716/\">California</a> mall, they run into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jubilee/29-4562/\">Jubilee</a>. With Carol in control, she decided to get a new hairdo in the style of Ms. Marvel, and later picked up some personal belongings from her old apartment, she even made Rogue wear the Ms. Marvel costume. The two women did not manage to get their difficulties sorted out again, as soon after, the X-Men fought an all-out battle with the merged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bastion/29-40568/\">Nimrod/Master Mold Sentinel</a>, which ended with the robot being pulled through the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siege-perilous/18-40957/\">Siege Perilous</a>, a mystic gateway that judged all beings and placed them into different lives. On its way into the portal, Nimrod / Master Mold grabbed Rogue, ready to take her along. The X-Men were unsure what to do but, knowing that this was their only chance at victory, Rogue ordered Dazzler to blast both the robot and herself through the Siege. It was said that everyone who entered the magical portal would be judged by the highest of powers, the good and ill of their lives being weighed in the cosmic balance, only to be reborn into a new life without remembering the old one.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Battle of the Personalities</h3>Weeks later, Rogue emerged in her room in the Australian Outback town with her memory completely intact. At first, she thought that the whole explanation of cosmic balance and second chances was a hoax, but then she discovered that she no longer had Carol\u2018s abilities and memories. She was now ground-bound and vulnerable. Suddenly she was attacked by Ms. Marvel. It seemed that the Siege Perilous had attempted to separate the two women and provide each one with a body her own, yet there wasn't enough life-force to sustain both of them. Rogue tried to escape through Gateway\u2019s portals and was sent to the <a href=\"../../savage-land/34-21766/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Savage Land</a>. Ms. Marvel meanwhile ended up on <a href=\"../../muir-island/34-43505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muir Island</a>, after being possessed by the <a href=\"../../shadow-king/29-14889/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King</a>, she followed Rogue and continued the battle. Whoever had the upper hand of the battle was healthy, while the other withered away. Rogue was about to give up, since she didn\u2019t want to \u201ckill\u201c Ms. Marvel for a second time, when suddenly <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a> stepped in. He rendered both, and when Rogue woke up, Magneto had used machinery to drain/kill Carol\u2018s body and restore Rogue to full power, without the Carol personality in her head. Since the power transfer temporarily scrambled her absorption powers, they could to such and had the beginnings of a relationship.</td></tr><tr><td><h3>Savage Land and Muir Island</h3>The pair found themselves caught in a war being fought in the Savage Land, between <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a> and <a href=\"../../ka-zar/29-3558/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ka-Zar</a> and <a href=\"../../zaladane/29-21948/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaladane</a> and the <a href=\"../../savage-land-mutates/65-41180/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Savage Land Mutates</a>. Rogue regained her abilities, her own and those of Ms. Marvel, in the middle of the conflict, right in time to change the odds in their favor. However, Rogue was shocked by Magneto's viciousness when he killed <a href=\"../../zaladane/29-21948/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaladane</a>, and she ended their romance before it even began.<br /><br />The X-Men were busy in <a href=\"../../shiar/65-55854/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shi\u2019ar</a> space at that time, so Rogue decided to head to Muir Island. However, the supreme telepath known as the <a href=\"../../shadow-king/29-14889/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King</a> had taken over the minds of the residents there and Rogue quickly fell under his influence. The many residents were forced to battle each other in tournaments held by <a href=\"../../moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moira MacTaggert</a>, much to the delight of the Shadow King, who fed off the negative emotional energies routed through <a href=\"../../polaris/29-1473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polaris</a>. Once they returned to Earth, the X-Men tried to help, but were captured as well, with only Forge still being free. He developed a neural spike cannon and psionic catalyst and succeeded in freeing Rogue, <a href=\"../../banshee/29-9708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a> and Wolverine from the mind control. Together with Xavier and <a href=\"../../x-factor/65-24131/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Factor</a>, they were able to free all of the Muir Islanders and defeat the Shadow King.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Blue Team</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"548982\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/548982-rogue_00_super.jpg\" title=\"Rogue gains her iconic costume\"><img id=\"548982\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/548982-rogue_00_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Rogue gains her iconic costume\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rogue gains her iconic costume</div></div></div></div><p>The X-Men were officially established again, with the original five X-Men and several other former members returning to the fold. In fact there were enough X-Men to divide them into two squads. Rogue was assigned to the Blue Strike Force led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, also including <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a>, <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a>, who had joined the X-Men during Rogue\u2019s absence. Their first mission of the new team involved battling Magneto, the man she might have loved, but the master of magnetism didn\u2019t listen to any of Rogue\u2019s attempts to convince him to stop the fight and attacked her without remorse. Gambit was a man of secrets and mysteries. Just like Rogue, he kept his real name secret, only for the time-traveling X-Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a>, to reveal it as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Remy LeBeau</a> and accuse him of becoming a traitor to the team. Though she knew neither man well, Rogue sided with Gambit in this conflict, reasoning that Gambit couldn\u2019t be held accountable for something he had not yet done. However, when later that day a woman showed up at the X-Men\u2019s doorstep, claiming to be Gambit\u2019s wife, she was not sure about trusting Gambit anymore. He explained himself, that the woman was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bella-donna/29-7896/\">Bella Donna Boudreaux</a>, a member of a rival guild from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-orleans/34-55684/\">New Orleans</a>, and while Gambit had indeed married her, he had not seen her in many years and considered their relationship long over.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stryfe/29-7616/\">Stryfe</a>\u2018s assassination attempt on Xavier with a special form of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/techno-organic/12-43631/\">techno-organic</a> virus united all of the X-Teams to hunt the villain down during the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-cutioners-song/39-42178/\">X-Cutioner\u2019s Song</a>. In battle with his minions, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-liberation-front/65-28349/\">Mutant Liberation Front</a>, Rogue\u2019s eyes were damaged by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/strobe/29-27418/\">Strobe</a>\u2019s heat blast. Temporarily blinded, Rogue was taken off the active roster and took some time to recover. Her feelings for Gambit grew and, after her sight had returned, the pair spent a romantic night out in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a>. Rogue offered to tell Gambit her real name but he declined, saying that names didn't say anything about who a person is. Not much later, Gambit was called back to his home to avenge his brother's death and Rogue accompanied him. During their stay in New Orleans, she accidentally absorbed part of Bella Donna's mind and was flooded with the memories of the happy times she spent with Gambit \u2013 kissing, touching and loving one another \u2013 all things denied to Rogue. For a split-second, Rogue was tempted to touch Bella Donna again and permanently absorb it, but she reminded herself that it was wrong and the absorption wore off. Back in Westchester, Rogue was part of the X-Men team that succeeded in bringing in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>, who began living in the detention chambers beneath the mansion.</p><h3>Final Good-bye to Cody</h3><p>After having some personal time-off, Rogue knew it was time for her yearly visit to her birthplace in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mississippi/34-56246/\">Mississippi</a> and to visit her first boyfriend, Cody, who lies comatose. Rogue first tells <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a>, her new love interest, that she is leaving and informs him that Cody was the first boy to ever kiss her, and that it was on that moment she found out about her mutant powers. Gambit and Rogue have words about her leaving alone, but she does what she wants anyway. Despite the warnings of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, Gambit later decides to follow Rogue. At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bella-donna/29-7896/\">Bella Donna</a> and the other members of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/assassins-guild/65-7903/\">Assassins Guild</a> mourn the death of their patriarch, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marius/29-7902/\">Marius</a>. Bella Donna is approached by Candra, who suggests to bring new life in their now no-longer standing pact. Bella Donna promises to think about it. Bella Donna decides to take revenge on Rogue for stealing memories from her when she lay in a coma and kidnaps Cody. Rogue finds out, but is too late. Bella Donna promises to do the same with everyone else Rogue holds dear, just to make her pay. Rogue quickly moves over to action and tries to find a way to rescue Cody, unaware that the Assassins watch Gambit\u2019s every move.</p><p>Rogue receives an astral warning from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tante-mattie/29-7899/\">Tante Mattie</a>. Mattie promises that she will do anything she can to keep Cody safe, if Rogue promises to rescue Gambit. Rogue agrees and helps an outnumbered Gambit fighting some ninja\u2019s who work for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/assassins-guild/65-7903/\">Assassins Guild</a>. Later, Rogue and Gambit relax in a forest. Rogue makes Gambit promise not to follow her anymore, but he can\u2019t keep his promise after he learns that Bella Donna is behind the attacks. Rogue later makes it to New Orleans and finds herself getting attacked by a large number of Assassins. Meanwhile, Bella Donna agrees with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/candra/29-7900/\">Candra</a> to re-create their pact, after she is finished with Rogue.</p><p>Rogue finds herself being attacked by a large crowd of Assassins. While she begins to fight her way through, Gambit continues his way to New Orleans. Gambit gets a warning from his cousin, Emil Lapin, to turn back, but Gambit doesn\u2019t obey. He makes it to the French Quarters but is ambushed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fifolet/29-14171/\">Fifolet</a> and is captured. Rogue makes her way to Bella Donna\u2019s house, where she has to fight both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gris-gris/29-14176/\">Gris-Gris</a> and Fifolet. She defeats the two Assassins, but is then approached by the External Candra. Candra takes Rogue to the room where Cody, Gambit and Tante Mattie are imprisoned. Candra takes away the powers of both Rogue and Bella Donna. The two enemies attack each other and end up with Bella Donna throwing a knife through Rogue\u2019s shoulder.</p><p>Rogue denies the pain she feels and pulls the knife out of her shoulder and continues her fight against Bella Donna. Rogue runs away, in the hope to buy some time to recover. Bella Donna says that she has enough of Candra\u2019s games, knowing that she used her. Candra threatens Bella Donna and makes her promise to kill Rogue, and in return Candra promises to make things the way they were before. If not, Candra will kill Bella Donna and all the other Guilds. Bella Donna pursues and finds Rogue, but Rogue has had enough of the fighting and knocks Bella Donna out. Gambit frees himself and tries to fight Candra, but she holds him back, wanting to kill him. Rogue arrives just in time and orders Candra to release him. She does and wants to kill Cody instead. Rogue feels her powers coming back and fights Candra, defeating her. Cody is dying, but Tante Mattie uses her magic skills to allow Rogue to enter Cody\u2019s mind and say one last goodbye, before Cody moves over to the next life.</p><h3>On the Road</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"132618\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/132618-181105-rogue.jpg\" title=\"The Kiss\"><img id=\"132618\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/132618-181105-rogue_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Kiss\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Kiss</div></div></div></div><p>Both Rogue and Gambit were with the X-Men when the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mkraan-crystal/18-44426/\">M'Kraan Crystal</a> was about to destroy Earth and the rest of the universe as well. Just as the crystal wave struck, Rogue took her final chance and kissed Gambit passionately. However, the crystal wave washed over without effect, and Gambit was left comatose from Rogue's kiss, with Rogue now possessing a large part of his memories and dark secrets. It was too much for her to deal with and she ran away to wander the country, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> going with her to keep her company. After a few days, Gambit awoke from his coma and chased them down. When he found them, Rogue told him that she didn't know exactly what she had seen only that it was something terrible and that it had been haunting him ever since. As Gambit wouldn\u2019t confide in her and outright tell her what his dark secret was, Rogue reasoned that, if they couldn't trust each other, they also couldn't love each other. Rogue moved again and began working as a waitress.</p><h3>Joseph</h3><p>Operatives of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/operation-zero-tolerance/39-43899/\">Operation: Zero Tolerance</a> found her, however. They kidnapped her and were preparing to kill her when one of the OZT soldiers started throwing off magnetic pulses, freeing Rogue and taking down Bastion. He revealed himself to be <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/joseph/29-15063/\">Joseph</a>. Rogue was unsure how to handle the man in front of her, as he seemed to be a de-aged Magneto. They began traveling by car to reach the X-Men, but <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a> happened first. The X-Men and Avengers had teamed up to defeat Onslaught and had learned that Magneto might have caused Xavier's change into Onslaught, somehow. Therefore, an Avengers/X-Men team, consisting of Captain America, Gambit, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, Thor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>, were sent out to find and subdue him. Rogue and Joseph traveled back to with the Avengers and X-Men team to confront Onslaught. After Onslaught was destroyed, Rogue and Joseph joined the X-Men. Rogue was attracted to both Joseph and Gambit, causing intense friction between all three.</p><h3>Adventures in Space</h3><p>Later Christmas day, the X-Men confronted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gladiator/29-4653/\">Gladiator</a>, leader of the Shi'ar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">Imperial Guard</a>, who then teleported <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a>, Rogue, Joseph, Gambit, Bishop and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trish-tilby/29-3178/\">Trish Tilby</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar-empire/34-23199/\">Shi\u2019ar Empire</a> to defeat the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phalanx/29-9651/\">Phalanx</a> and keep them from destroying the entire Imperium. Among this squad, Beast was the senior member, yet all turned to Rogue for leadership and she filled the expected role. In their battles against the Phalanx, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a>, a member of the Shi\u2019ar Imperial family and former enemy of the X-Men, accompanied them. Against all odds, they succeeded. As Deathbird was taking them back to Earth through a Shi\u2019ar Stargate, a larger ship destroyed the Stargate and the X-Men crash-landed. There, they were confronted by a trio of bounty hunters and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nanny/29-7567/\">Nanny</a>. With their powers negated by an inhibitor field and unable to escape, Rogue and Remy spent their first night together. Albeit prisoners of their enemies, they used the chance to physically express their love to each other. The next day, Gambit was put on trial by someone wearing the guise of Erik the Red. The X-Men were joined by Angel, Psylocke and, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maggott/29-15072/\">Maggot</a>. During the trial, Rogue and the others learned of Gambit's past dealings with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Sinister</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a>, the same memories Rogue had absorbed from Gambit\u2019s mind when the M'Kraan Crystal passed overhead. When the X-Men departed to Westchester, Rogue left him, though to a certain degree her decision was influenced by Remy\u2019s own residual personality in her head. He wanted to atone for his crime and deemed this an appropriate punishment.</p><h3>Back Home</h3><p>At one point, Rogue was given the chance to have her powers removed. She had learned of the Agee Institute through TV news and found that Dr. Agee really was capable of removing the mutant gene.</p><p>When Mystique learned of Rogue\u2019s plan, she became rather angry with her daughter. However, despite all of Mystique\u2019s warnings, Rogue still was about to undergo the treatment, only declining in the last instant for one sole reason, she feared that the device would be used on other mutants against their will, and without her strength, she would have had no way to make sure that the apparatus would be destroyed after her operation. She made the decision to destroy the machine, which could have given her a normal life. Driven by guilt, Rogue secretly sneaked out of the mansion and flew in search of Gambit, yet she found no trace of him or the mysterious fortress where the trial took place. Eventually, Gambit ran across some of the X-Men and returned with them, having been granted a second chance. When Rogue and Gambit finally reunited it wasn't quite the reconciliation they had in mind, when Gambit was stranded in Antarctica to save his life he shared a bond between a mutant being called <a href=\"/mary-purcell/29-47441/\">Mary Purcell</a>, in time she fell in love with Gambit and became over protective, when she had found out that Rogue was his true soul-mate she lashed out on the both of them during and outing Rogue and Gambit were on, they defeated her and Rogue asked Gambit yet again if he really loves her and due to the secret that Gambit was hiding he was unfortunately unable to answer, she departs and lets him know that she cannot wait forever.</p><h3>The Hunt For Xavier</h3><p>During the X-Men's search for Professor X the X-Men were required to be split up into two different teams as there were separate locations that could possibly lead to the destination of their mentor, Rogue was assigned to the team who were headed to Tajikinistan, as they journeyed through the apparent location of Charles they found it wasn't Charles who was there after all but a little girl named <a href=\"/nina/29-12078/\">Nina,</a> her guardian told the X-Men and Rogue how they managed to come to</p><p>Tajikinistan and how there was a link between Nina and Charles, after they all managed to explain themselves the X-Men and Rogue were assaulted by a sentient <a href=\"/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebrite Alpha</a> that had somehow fused with their ally <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Collosus</a>, Rogue was required to leave the battlefield and help support Nina and her guardian, as the raging battle went on Nina alerted Rogue that Storm was apparently dead, as shocked as Rogue was she knew it could not be true so she went to see if she could assist Storm and Gambit in their fight with the Cerebrite Alpha but it was too late, Storm was no where to be seen and Gambit was unconscious in the arms of the sentient Cerebrite Alpha, looking upon all this Rogue saw that Gambit was in for a fatal blow and she knew she could not let that happen, she successfully managed to rescued him out of the clutches of the sentient Cerebrite Alpha but at a price, during the fight her gloves some how got cut which allowed her to make skin to skin contact with Gambit in the process releasing the mutant being Mary Purcell who was still hiding within Gambit even after her previous encounter with her, with Rogue wondering what exactly it was that had just happened she was distracted and left open for a full on attack by the sentient Cerebrite Alpha in the process allowing Nina to be captured by it.</p><p>A day later while the battle for Xavier had reached an almost a fierce finale for the other team over in San Francisco they realized the only way for them to find their supposedly dead teammates would be to \"kill\" themselves too, having done this Night Crawler was keeping a close watch on the teammates he thought had just been slaughtered mysteriously and automatically assumed that all hope was lost unless he somehow managed to get back to Rogue's team in time even though they never answered his previous calls to them,he managed to find them and soon they were off to go help the fight for Xavier. Rogue, Colossus, Gambit and Night Crawler formed an assault team to help save the Professor, Rogue and Colossus proved to be formidable opponents against the Cerebrite Alpha but soon the whole team had already been put into the containment pods, Nina saw that the only way she could possibly help was to help make Charles whole again and in the process bring back his telepathic powers, this proved to be successful and during the ordeal \"Rogue and the X-Men\" freed themselves of the containment pods, the Cerebrite Alpha stated that it never planned on killing those X-Men but to make it's \"Dream\" a reality had now needed to do it, it brought out the <a>Xavier Protocols</a> and almost immediately they were set to destroy, the \"X-Men and Rogue\" had began to die out before Charles' eyes and under a minute were dead, little did the Cerebrite Alpha know that the team of mutants that had just been slaughtered were not the X-Men but robotic clones of them, the real X-Men and Rogue were by Charles' side and he made a telepathic rapport between all of them to strike at the specific targeted areas of the Cerebrite Alpha to destroy it once and for all, they were successful in it's defeat and in it's removal.</p><h3>Magneto Again</h3><p>After the Magneto War and Joseph's funeral, Rogue was left behind while the other X-Men were abducted for a journey through time and dimensions. She flew to Genosha, now under Magneto\u2019s rule, to try and reason with the man she came to know as a friend once more. Yet, after aiding Quicksilver and the Genosha Cabinet in fighting off the Mutate known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zealot/29-50961/\">Zealot</a>, Magneto ordered her to leave or face criminal charges. When the team returned, Xavier began to become mentally unhinged. Xavier pushed the X-Men too far and Storm called in Scott and Jean to reason with the Professor. They failed to help Xavier, who then dissolved the X-Men and told them to go their own way, since he had no use for failures. The majority of the team left on personal vacations and Storm stayed behind to keep Xavier from harming himself.</p><h3>Apocalypse and the High Evolutionary</h3><p>Rogue, Nightcrawler and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Shadowcat</a> began their vacation. During this time, they met up with Mystique, who was on the run from the Japanese government. She was being tracked by Sunfire, but Rogue managed to convince Shiro that Mystique was innocent of the murders she was being charged with.</p><p>After settling things with Mystique and Sunfire, they received a call that Wolverine had been killed on the surrogate X-Men's mission to save the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mannites/29-15061/\">Mannites</a>. At the mansion, Xavier revealed that he had pretended to lose control in order to uncover a traitor in their midst. The traitor was discovered when Wolverine's deceased body reverted to its true form; that of a Skrull warrior. The true Wolverine had been kidnapped months ago by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> working with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>, who was brainwashed into being his Horseman of Death. However, the X-Men were able to snap him out of the mental hold and also stopped Apocalypse\u2019s plans to extract the energies of the mutants, only referred to as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-twelve/65-47547/\">Twelve</a>, which would have granted him omnipotence.</p><p>Weeks later, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a> activated an anti-mutation wave that switched off the mutant gene in everyone across the planet. Finally completely normal, Rogue worked for her law degree and tried to get Mystique out of jail. However, Rogue refused to use criminal methods to get her mother out of jail. When the X-Men learned that the anti-mutation wave was going to reverse itself and horribly mutate the entire world Rogue immediately returned to the team to stop the disaster. They raided the Evolutionary's satellite, disabled the anti-mutation field and defeated Sinister, who had been manipulating the Evolutionary. With her powers active again, Mystique soon broke out of prison and she vowed vengeance on Anna for abandoning her in her time of need.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><h3>Leader</h3>About six months later, Rogue was elected the new field leader for an X-Men squad. She successfully led the X-Men against the <a href=\"../../the-crimson-pirates/65-50340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crimson Pirates</a>, the <a href=\"../../the-goth/65-15025/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goth</a>, and the <a href=\"../../neo/65-41261/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neo</a>, proving to herself that she has a good instinct for making hard and risky decisions. Her style varied a lot from Storm\u2019s and Cyclops\u2018, who usually chose to play it safe. During the crisis known as <a href=\"../../maximum-security/39-49092/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Security</a>, Earth was turned into a penal colony for alien prisoners. Rogue encountered the <a href=\"../../blood-brothers/29-15023/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blood Brothers</a> attacking <a href=\"../../zcann/29-41220/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Z'Cann</a>, one of Xavier's <a href=\"../../cadre-k/65-41179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cadre K</a>. Rogue drove off the attackers but Z'Cann was critically wounded. The Skrull girl deliberately made contact with Rogue, transferring her memories of Xavier's plans to the mutant. With this information, the X-Men managed to meet and rescue Bishop, who had returned from deep space. Unfortunately, Z'Cann was unfamiliar with Rogue\u2019s powers, and to make sure that the information would be received, she even boosted Rogue\u2019s absorption power with her own telepathy. As a result, her Skrull deviant genes mixed with Rogue's half- <a href=\"../../kree/65-7588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kree</a> physiology in an unexpected manner. Rogue was now capable of calling forth the memories and abilities of anyone she had absorbed in the past. She could not control this manifestation of her powers and would spontaneously sprout claws, fire optic blasts or adapt organic steel skin. She gained some self-control through meditative training with Wolverine but, because of the disability her new powers gave her, Rogue stepped down as team leader.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><a href=\"/dreams-end/39-56127/\">Dream's End</a></h3>Around the same time, Mystique led the Brotherhood in another attempt to kill Senator Kelly and spread the <a href=\"../../legacy-virus/12-42281/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus</a> to humans only. Rogue, Bishop and Wolverine confronted Mystique on this. In the fight, it became painfully clear that Mystique still held a grudge against Rogue for having abandoned her in a time of need. She used a blade on Rogue\u2019s gut, causing a serious wound that would have been fatal, if Rogue had been without Wolverine\u2019s healing abilities. Rogue recovered quickly and returned the \u201cfavor\u201c on Mystique, inflicting a similar, critical knife wound. Still, victory was too late, as Moira MacTaggert died because of the injuries received when the Brotherhood blew up her lab complex. As a result of this conflict, Rogue and the X-Men learned of Destiny's journals, a collection of diaries written by the deceased precog that depicted the future of mutant kind.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><a href=\"/x-treme-x-men/49-9411/\">X-Treme Team</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"287456\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/287456-150150-rogue_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Treme X-Man\"><img id=\"287456\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/287456-150150-rogue_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Treme X-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Treme X-Man</div></div></div></div>During her time on the <a href=\"../../x-treme-x-men/40995/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Treme X-Men</a> team, led by Storm, Rogue requested <a href=\"../../sage/4559/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sage</a> to use her powers to help evolve Rogue so she could control the powers that she absorbed. Sage agreed to this and helped out Rogue, enabling Rogue to be able to use any powers that she had absorbed in the past. When the enemy known as <a href=\"../../vargas/29-4643/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vargas</a> foresaw his death at the hands of Rogue, he attempted to get rid of Rogue before she had the chance to kill him. He ambushes her and speared Rogue, but since Rogue possessed the powers of Wolverine and the <a href=\"../../hulk/2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>, she was able to recover. Rogue would confront Vargas in Psylocke 's costume and begin battling him. It has not been revealed if Rogue did actually kill Vargas or if she had let him leave. Afterwards Rogue would figure out that Destiny\u2019s future predictions were only probabilities. She also inherits a mansion from Destiny and the X-Treme team would stay there to recuperate from the fight. Rogue and Gambit became powerless and they decided to leave the team in an attempt to help develop their relationship. Rogue and Gambit had a bit of trouble running into mutants that hated homo-sapiens, they would start a fight with Rogue and Gambit and beat them. The two ended up residing in a beach house at Valle Soleda where both mutants and humans lived peacefully together. Bishop and Sage would often visit the couple and eventually they decided to help fight Sage\u2019s enemy, in return Sage would restore Gambit\u2019s abilities.</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Return</h3><p>Rogue and Gambit returned to the X-Men's main team while Rogue's abilities were slowly returning to her, however the abilities she gained from Ms. Marvel seemed to have been lost. On one mission they were able to successfully save <a href=\"/xorn/29-3183/\">Xorn</a> and brought him back to the mansion. They also fought a new Brotherhood when they followed them back to the Mansion and attacked them there. Rogue battled <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, who almost killed her, but she was saved by <a href=\"/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a>.</p><p>In Rogue\u2019s own series, she travels back to the south to save a young mutant girl from her powers. She meets a man named Campbell St. Ange who was immune to Rogue\u2019s touch. During her time in the south she was determined to find out about her mother, forcefully absorbing her Aunt Carrie\u2019s memories to find out what happened. Rogue would eventually encounter her mother\u2019s spirit and set it free, Rogue returns to her Aunt Carrie and tells her that she considers her a mother. Rogue went along with Sunfire to investigate a photo of her and Sunfire doing criminal activities. Rogue would learn that Blindspot had erased her memories. Rogue also accidentally absorbs Sunfire\u2019s powers permanently. Blindspot erases Rogue\u2019s memories again which caused Rogue to engage in a battle with the X-Men.</p><p>Rogue would return to the X-Mansion but finds that Gambit was being seduced by Foxx. It was later revealed that Foxx was actually Mystique who disapproved of her relationship with Gambit. Mystique proceeds to try and seduce Gambit by transforming into Rogue. It was not revealed if Gambit did anything but he insisted he did not. When Rogue discovered that it was Mystique trying to seduce Gambit it angered her. Her relationship with Gambit takes a bit of a turn when she finds out he knew about it but failed to tell her. Afterwards, Mystique asks to stay at the mansion and work with the X-Men. After <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-day/41003/\">M-Day</a> happened Apocalypse was re-awoken. Gambit tried to protect Rogue and the X-Men but was transformed into the new horseman Death. Gambit would proceed to try and kill Rogue, twice, but soon left with Sunfire to be rid of Apocalypse\u2019s brainwash.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"139898\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/139898-29951-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"Rogue's new team\"><img id=\"139898\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/139898-29951-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Rogue's new team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rogue's new team</div></div></div></div>When Professor Xavier gathered a group of X-Men, including <a href=\"../../havok/29-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a>, to go into the <a href=\"../../shiar-empire/34-23199/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shi\u2019ar Empire</a> after <a href=\"../../vulcan/29-21233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vulcan</a>, Anna was offered a role as a strike team leader by Cyclops. With the luxury to choose her own team, Anna quickly put together a motley crew of X-Men and former villains, consisting of <a href=\"../../iceman/29-1464/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"../../cannonball/29-1496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball</a>, <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cable</a>, <a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabretooth</a> (Rogue injected him with Nano-Sentinels in order to control him), <a href=\"../../lady-mastermind/29-12055/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Mastermind</a>, <a href=\"../../omega-sentinel/29-3421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karima Shapandar</a>, and Mystique (who she chose because she wanted to personally keep an eye on her). The first mission for her team was to stop the <a href=\"../../children-of-the-vault/65-43765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Children of the Vault</a> (advanced humans who had attacked the mansion). After she and her team defeated the Children of the Vault, Anna announced her team\u2019s departure from the mansion. Anna and her squad had to take down a villain named <a href=\"../../pandemic/29-42336/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pandemic</a>. Pandemic's goal was to take Anna's power and add it to his collection of powers (that he had already absorbed). Upon capturing Anna, he infected her with the disease called strain 88, and it took a very bad effect on her. When her squad of X-men took Pandemic down they freed Anna, but she was too weak to do anything and had to be hospitalized on Cable's island, while a new threat was released from within the mind of <a href=\"../../lady-mastermind/29-12055/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Regan Wyngarde</a> (Lady Mastermind) called the <a href=\"../../hecatomb/29-74334/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hecatomb</a>. With the other X-Men, barely surviving an attack from the Hecatomb (as Sabretooth ran off with their ship), Cable mind merged with a Shi'ar species that wanted to destroy the Hecatomb. The two had no other choice but to wake Anna from her comatose state of mind. She easily defeated the alien by absorbing its powers and memories, since the Hecatomb had already taken in so many lives and Shi'ar species beforehand. Although she had recovered, she now seemed to have a hunger to absorb the people around her. As they now were not part of the mansion, the X-Men took refuge in Mystique\u2019s home, where they were attacked by the new Marauders, including Lady Mastermind and Mystique, the latter shooting Anna in the stomach. Things weren\u2019t looking up for Anna, she was half dead, her team now consisted of Iceman and <a href=\"../../cannonball/29-1496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball</a>, and she was carried off by the enemies that blind-sided her.</td></tr><tr><td><h3><a href=\"/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a></h3><p>It was made clear that her purpose was to give Sinister <a href=\"../../destinys-diaries/18-44250/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destiny's Diaries</a>, since she had been the only one who had read most of them.

Mystique and Gambit, concerned about Anna\u2019s survival, confront Sinister, he confirms that she would soon die. Enraged when Sinister refused to put any effort into curing Anna, Mystique forced his cheek against Anna's, using Anna's augmented powers to kill him instantly. Upon Gambit's arrival with the baby (the first known mutant birth since <a href=\"../../m-day/12-41003/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day</a>, later named <a href=\"../../hope-summers/29-49329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hope</a>) Mystique states that it was revealed in Destiny's Diaries what she had to do. Following through with Destiny's prophecies she pushed baby Hope against Anna's cheek as a means of healing her dying daughter. While at first there doesn't seem to be any effect, but minutes later, Anna wakes up. By doing this, Hope erased all the psyches and powers Anna had absorbed throughout her life. Anna, realizing her mother put an innocent baby's life on the line (even if to cure her), then turns on Mystique, stating that no one is ever safe whenever Mystique is around, and not knowing that Hope has cured her, she touches Mystique's face (intending to kill her) causing her foster mother to collapse to the ground. However this backfires, and Anna is trapped, having only her own psyche and the thoughts of her worst enemy, her foster mother Mystique, in her mind. While Gambit tries to comfort her, she pushes him away, stating that she needs her space and time alone and if he truly cared, he\u2019d give it to her. She then leaves Gambit alone at the Marauders / Mr. Sinister\u2019s base.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h3><a href=\"/manifest-destiny/39-55673/\">Manifest Destiny</a></h3><p>In Manifest Destiny, in an attempt to gain control over her powers and life again, Anna traveled to Kooroowi. Heading on motorcycle to the abandoned X-base, she reflects on the entirety of her experiences as an X-Man. In the course of her reflection and meditation, Anna is continually interrupted by the presence of Mystique\u2019s psychic personality echo that was left in her mind. The pair trade words several times, each time with Anna affirming that, though she\u2019s aware that Mystique still cares for her, she'd still prefer not to have a psychic echo in her head giving her advice or making her doubt herself.

Anna grants her access to the town on the condition that she is left in peace. When the anthropologist interrupts her some time later, asking her about some technological debris she discovered, Anna claimed to be ignorant despite knowing that it likely came from one of the X-Men's battles with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/reavers/65-9726/\">Reavers</a>. Growing tired of her waiting game, the anthropologist reveals that she is well aware of Anna's identity, confirming Anna's original suspicions that the woman wasn't who she pretended to be. Unfortunately a third party interrupted their interaction, a crew of Shi'ar pirates seeking to obtain a technological find of great value. Anna is to soon learn that her guest is not Mystique, her original suspect; but the AI known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger/29-40862/\">Danger</a>.</p><p>Danger reveals that she had originally intended to use Anna in her foremost revenge plot against Xavier. However the resulting battle soon has Anna, Danger, Xavier and Gambit working collectively to force the Shi'ar pirates to flee Earth. It is in this process that Danger resolves her conflict with Xavier, and explains why Anna was never able to gain control over her mutant powers.</p><p>Danger stated that it was the traumatic damage of the incident that sent Cody into a lifelong coma that was the first in a series of subconsciously built psychological barriers formed in Anna\u2019s mind to help her cope with the her guilt. Each personality absorbed built up another barrier, until her mind contained so many barriers, that it prevented her powers from developing past their infant stages.</p><p>With this new insight and Danger's aid, Xavier is able to enter Anna's mind and permanently remove the psychological barriers, including erasing the remnant of Mystique\u2019s psyche that was trapped in Anna's mind. When the process was concluded, Anna awakens to feel her skin tingling, a feeling she compares to having every cell being on fire. Anna removes herself for several hours of meditation, as she explores the new sensations of having a free mind. When she\u2019s ready, she asks Gambit to help her test her control.

Anna is quick to grab <a href=\"../../ares/29-11940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ares</a> and absorbs his powers. Ares initially is dismissive of her attack and claims that she could not absorb him, a boast that proves to be wrong as she weakens him enough for him to be susceptible to Gambit\u2019s energy blasts, leaving him bloody and stunned.

Rogue tells him that he cannot do that without Surge\u2019s permission, before they kiss. Rogue knows it is because of the telepathy, and warns Magneto once again to back off from Surge.

Indra tells Rogue that he doesn\u2019t want to be a fighter, before almost uncontrollably using his powers to armor up and confront Rogue with a multitude of weapons, a power he's never displayed before.

Regrettably, Destiny was possessed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/proteus/29-2165/\">Proteus</a> when she made telepathic contact with Blindfold, thus Proteus was able to possess Blindfold's body as well. Proteus was able to fool Blindfold into gathering a team of X-Men (Rogue, Trance, Psylocke, Colossus, Nightcrawler, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/husk/29-3426/\">Husk</a>, and Magneto) to travel to so he (Proteus) can have the chance to kill them.</p><p>After arriving, Blindfold is quick to flee. Anna attempts to find her, but is instead confronted by Proteus, who has possessed Blindfold and resurrected Destiny. After Proteus fully possesses Blindfold's body, he takes each X-Men down one by one, except Colossus, whom is thrown all the way to the X-Jet. In the end, Proteus possesses Nightcrawler as well. Proteus learns he can control more than one body at the same time. Cautiously, Anna chooses not to take chances, and absorbs Nightcrawler's powers, teleporting herself and everyone else outside of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira\u2019s</a> old lab.

Leaving Anna and Magneto by themselves. Erik is quick to use his powers, throwing Colossus at Proteus. Anna absorbs Betsy's powers and uses the psy-knife on him, but to no effect. Magneto then uses his powers to lift a piece of magnetized rock with him and Proteus (in Blindfold's body) on it, taking the fight to outer space. Anna, using Psylocke's powers, breaks Proteus' psychic hold on everyone, except for Husk. Meanwhile, Magneto throws up a magnetic shield against Proteus (Blindfold), so that he can't possess Erik\u2019s body. Proteus, upset, takes them back to the ground. When Husk is close to touch Anna (which would give Proteus control over Anna\u2019s body), Psylocke arrives and uses her psi-knife on Paige, setting her free from Proteus\u2019 possession. Proteus and Magneto continue on fighting, when Erik reveals he's been distracting Proteus in order to understand his energy pattern, as he's made of pure energy, electrons. This way, Magneto is able to purge Proteus out of Blindfold's body, dispersing him completely. Psylocke asks him where Proteus is, to which Magneto replies, that he doesn't know and that Proteus will come back sooner or later. Anna and Destiny meet at the shore. Irene tells her she will be dead before the day is out, but that she's proud of her daughter. Destiny also implies that Rogue is bound to Hope in ways that matter, and with that, they say a finale goodbye. Magneto hits on Rogue again, but Anna is quick to put him in his place.

Bastion extends his bionic arm in order to kill Hope, but Nightcrawler teleports right in front of her. Kurt ends up impaled on Bastion's arm. Anna witnesses the entire battle in despair. Kurt prays to God to strengthen him for one last jump. He lands on the rocks of Utopia, his last words to Hope are that he believes in her. He then dies. Anna was able to return to Utopia to attend her foster brother, Kurt\u2019s funeral. After being trapped by Bastion\u2019s impenetrable dome, the X-Men are soon swarmed by Nimrods, leaving <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a> handless and Iceman\u2019s skin badly burnt. Cyclops entrusts Anna with one mission: evacuate all humans and non-combatants to the Atlantean column.</p><table class=\"t-editor full-width with-out-border\"><tbody><tr><td>After this, Cyclops instructs Rogue to protect Hope on Utopia. Rogue finds Hope crying. Rogue asks if Cable taught her not to cry, Hope tells her that he didn't mind when she cried, but to cry later. Hope tells Rogue she won't stand around and let people die on her behalf and asks Rogue to join her on the battlefield. Hope and Rogue arrive in time to save the others on the Golden Gate Bridge. After the crisis is over, Rogue attends Cable's funeral. After the service, Cyclops confronts her, telling Rogue that because of her they could be burying Hope, and that Nightcrawler and Cable\u2019s deaths could have been in vain. He demotes her, excluding Rogue from any strike team.<br /><h3>Aftermath</h3>After the X-Men got out of Legions warped reality each and every single one of them had a hard time adjusting back to normal life, Rogue in particular, her and Remy discuss her personality change back in The Age Of X, how her counterpart \"Legacy\" was the taker of lives and that keeping the memories of the dead in that reality are the price she had to pay for being the Angel of Death, Remy suggests that she go and see Emma Frost as she would be able to help her remove those memories from her mind but she declines as it was a promise she would not break, he mentions how she's keeping a promise that Legacy made but not the real Rogue, she agrees with him while he then brings up the kiss Legacy and Gambit of the Age Of X shared when they were alone with themselves, she remembers the passion and feelings Legacy felt at the time but then suggests if they kissed because she loved Gambit or because they might have died in time, Gambit brings up the reason why Rogue said she was afraid to love him in the first place, her power control, he then goes on to say that she was lying, not for him but for herself, he explains to her his take on love and that you should just know when you love someone, he then tells her that out of all the woman he has ever loved in his life none have compared to Rogue, he continues by saying that he is not a station for Rogue to come and stop at on the path of her life but her home and her end point and that when she is ready to realize this she will come to him but until then she should not come at all.<br /><br />Later on Rogue takes some time by herself but is accompanied by Magneto whom she makes clear to that she is not in the mood for anyone at the moment, he then admits that only 3 people in Utopia would he voluntarily seek their companionship and Rogue begin one of the ones that concerns him the most at the moment, she tells him that she does not want to be around him because she is unable to sort out the feelings that Legacy had for Magneto in The Age Of X, he was her anchor in her time of need, Magneto tries to cheer her up and tells Rogue that his counter part the General had feelings for Legacy too, Rogue's goes on to say that Magneto is nothing like the General and that their relationship is not relevant to what was happening there and then, she then goes on to say that Magneto is at his most dangerous when he seems more than willing to help someone she then asks if there is anything else about him that she needed to know, he replies with \"Yes, many things\" she tells him that it was a rhetorical question, Magneto moves closer on the subject and tells her that they were put together in The Age Of X for a reason, Rogue argues against that by saying that Moira wrote the \"script\" of everything that happened there, and that it was not by their own free will but she then gives and and tells Magneto she will talk with him, he takes her and they fly off, she asks where they are going to and he tells her \"The past\". Rogue and Magneto arrive at the National Holocaust Museum where he proceeds to tell her a \"parable\" that involves his past that includes killing a Nazi doctor at a very young age. Rogue asks what was the point of bringing her to the museum and telling her his story, to which he explains that he has done a lot of terrible things in his life most of which he does not regret and begins to tell her that The General was kind, noble, put other mutants before his pride, and says that The General everything that Magneto is not. He then tells her to go back to Gambit as her love \"enobles\" him. Later, once they return to Utopia, Rogue decides that she wants to make her own decision, not one based on Gambit, Magneto, or Legacy/Reaper's influence, about Magneto and their relationship, so that night she visits Magneto's room; telling him that she's \"too big to be afraid of the dark\" and that she \"can't\" promise anything beyond the night.</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2434013\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/2434013-x_men_15.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Legacy #269\"><img id=\"2434013\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/2434013-x_men_15_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Legacy #269\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Legacy #269</div></div></div></div><p>Rogue is a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant/12-40656/\">mutant</a> with the ability to drain a living being's essence upon physical contact, giving them a biophysical shock while synthesizing into her body their physical skills, memories, personality traits, and superhuman matrices to a varying degree. Prolonged physical touch could be lethal to whoever she contacts. After some work with Danger and Professor X, she has gained a control of her power. Now that she has conscious control of her ability, if she so chooses, she can now physically touch people without unwillingly absorbing their powers or minds.

Due to this mutation of the aforementioned virus, the majority of the total human and mutant population was infected, leading them to become <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-vi-locks/65-56186/\">Vi-Locks</a>. Rogue was shown to be one of the infected mutants and was turned into a Vi-Lock.</p><h3>Earth-9811</h3><p>In this reality, Rogue had a daughter with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> named Sarah (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crusader/29-47662/\">Crusader</a>).

A while ago she absorbed the memories and powers of Colossus, leaving him in a coma, it is unknown who's mind is in control, but she does wear Ms. Marvel's costume, and is haunted by memories of both the two heroes. After a recent trip to the Shi'ar Homeworld with the rest of the X-Men, Rogue has returned, and she, along with the rest of the X-Men are helping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a> to fight the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Goblin Queen</a>. Rogue and the rest of the X-Men were involved in the fall of the Goblin Queen, but was apparently killed by the newly reinstated S.H.I.E.L.D. Instead, she and the other X-Men were saved by their ally, Apocalypse, and taken to his Antarctic base. Rogue was later killed in battle against the Goblin Queen.</p><h3>Zombie Universe (Earth-2149)</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/39-40611/\">Marvel Zombies</a> story line, little is detailed about Rogue\u2019s life before the zombie plague arrived on Earth-2149, however it can be presumed that it followed much the same path as her Earth-616 counterpart. The most probable cause was the zombified <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a>'s attack on the Xavier Institute that have infected some mutants from the aforementioned Institute. Rogue appears together with some zombies who have attacked <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> of the Ultimates Universe.</p><h3>Bullet Points (Earth-70105)</h3><p>Rogue was a member of the X-Men.

She then has to borrow <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hyperion/29-6911/\">Hyperion</a>'s powers to destroy the asteroid, but before she accomplish the mission, she ran out of Hyperion's powers and was burned in Earth's atmosphere as she cannot resist it without the borrowed power.</p><h3>X-Punks (Earth-902)</h3><p>Rogue was one of the so called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-punks/65-56129/\">X-Punks</a>.</p><h3>Retro Men (Earth-1038)</h3><p>Rogue was one of the X-Men who have worn retro based costumes due to the fashion sense that became popular during those times. Her uniform also looks like the same uniform that the first X-Men had worn, like her other team mates. Though, Rogue was never called Rogue.</p><h3>Earth X (Earth-9997)</h3><p>The history of Rogue of Earth-9997 presumably mirrors that of her Earth-616 counterpart. In recent history on Earth-9997, the X-Men had disbanded due to the mutation of the entire human race due to the release of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">Terrigen Mists</a> into the Earth's atmosphere, and the death of Professor X through the psychic birth of the Skull. Rogue's ultimate fate is that she is deceased, however there are contradicting accounts of her apparent demise. According to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/machine-man/29-7242/\">X-51</a>, when checking the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watcher/29-7120/\">Watcher</a>'s records of human history regarding Rogue's lover, Gambit, it states that Gambit was 'dead'. Killed by the same kiss that took Rogue's life. However, some time later when Beast was reflecting back at the fates of various members of the X-Men, he would recount that Gambit was killed by an assassin. Rogue, grief stricken, would travel to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a> seeking out <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sauron/29-3180/\">Sauron</a>, believing their similar powers would cancel each other out and cure her of her mutant ability. This plan was said to have backfired and Rogue was killed as a result. The true fate of Rogue remains unrevealed, however one may presume that following her death, her soul resides in the Realm of the Dead, however she did not get involved in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/khnnr/29-56978/\">Mar-Vel</a>'s war against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/death/29-12620/\">Death</a>.</p><h3>Marvel Riot Age of Apocalypse (Earth-95120)</h3><p>Rogue was a member of the X-Men led by Magneto. Magneto then split the team so that they would accomplish various missions on fixing the reality.</p><h3>Roger Fieldston Mutate</h3><p>Together with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-universe/29-27193/\">Captain Universe</a>, they have seen Roger Fieldston and followed him. Rogue having touched Roger was unexpectedly mutated. She became bigger and more violent. She then fought the X-Men. As Captain Universe figures out that Roger would be able to reverse his powers, he touched Rogue and was back to normal.</p><h3>X-Men Revolution (Earth-1004)</h3><p>Rogue was one of the students of Bayville High School. Rogue was a friend to Jean, Scott, Kurt and Pietro. Together, they have formed a band and have composed songs about their experiences as mutants. Sharing the same interest in music, all of them became great friends and started performing in clubs.

Rogue gains a tail, blue skin, and three fingered hands and feet from the experience. In this state, she no longer absorbs other people's memories and can in fact touch people with no effects. It is unknown if this mutation is temporary or permanent.</p><h3>Earth-1025</h3><p>Rogue was a part of the X-Treme X-Men and had a mission to look for the diary of Destiny, a precognitive mutant who once played an important role in Rogue's past. She then stole some of Destiny's items and gained the precognitive powers of Destiny. She then used it and found out about an upcoming tidal wave.</p><h3>Earth-1031</h3><p>Apocalypse had made improvements on Professor X's powers to unlock the potentials of mutants, but the process then killed him.

She and Gambit have two children together, a boy named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/oliver-raven/29-54865/\">Olivier</a> and a girl named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/becca-steinhardt/29-74943/\">Becca</a>. When their children are captured by Mr. Sinister, Rogue succeeds in rescuing them along with the children of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott Summers</a>. However, Rogue is killed soon after when Mr. Sinister stabs her in the stomach while he was in the guise of Gambit.</p><h3>Fantastic Four Lead Anti- Mutant Regime (Earth-8112)</h3><p>In this reality, Rogue grew permanent feathered wings that protrude from her arms due her presumed misuse of the Banshee drug. She also possessed the permanent powers of Wolverine and was able to use to use them anytime without touching him. She is romantically involved with Wolverine under the influence of a Sentinel replica.</p><h3>Magnus Reality (Earth-27)</h3><p>Rogue gave birth to Magnus, who grew up to have similar powers to Rogue except his touch turned objects into metal. She was seemingly killed by Magnus' touch a week after his thirteenth birthday, but turned out to be alive when his body returned to this reality.</p><h3>Marvel Noir</h3><p>In this reality, Rogue is known as Anne Marie Rankin and was a student of Professor X. She can fit into anyone's attitude by means of imitating their traits. Professor X stated that she might play a good role in human social behavior. When Jean Grey is killed and her body is found, Anna Marie is contacted to help a detective find out who murdered Jean Grey. In the end, it is revealed that Jean Grey had posed as Anna, dying her hair, and that dead body belonged to Anna, murdered by Jean.</p><h3>Earth by the Marker</h3><p>In the universe of X-Men: Millennial Visions 2000, Rogue is now unable to get within a certain proximity of any living being without a specially designed suit keeping her from absorbing all life around her.</p><h2>What if?</h2><h3><b>What if the X-Men Stayed in Asgard? (Earth-904)</b></h3><p>The X-Men visited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard-marvel/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> and some decided to stay while some decide to go back to Earth. Rogue was among those who stayed. Rogue is happy there, with her siphoning powers gone. The powers she'd absorbed from Miss Marvel, however (including super strength and flight), stayed.</p><h3>What if the Phoenix Had Not Died and Rose Again? (Earth-9112)</h3><p>Rogue was among the members of the X-Men who have battled numerous villains after Jean and Cyclops have left the team. Rogue was also shown participating in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-wars/39-40978/\">Secret Wars</a>.</p><h3>What if Hulk Had Killed Wolverine? (Earth-93600)</h3><p>Rogue was among the members of the X-Men who'd been sent into a mission in Dallas, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/texas/34-55822/\">Texas</a> to battle the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adversary/29-26995/\">Adversary</a>. With the team defeated, Wolverine along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a>, Dazzler and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/longshot/29-6757/\">Longshot</a> were all killed. Following some events, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spiral/29-9722/\">Spiral</a> announced that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> was already on his rampage in Dallas. Rogue took the opportunity to avenge her teammates who had died. She joined the fight against the Hulk. She was almost defeated, but in the nick of time, some remaining X-Men and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freedom-force/65-24132/\">Freedom Force</a> appeared to help her and together defeated the Hulk. Rogue, along with the other concerned mutants mourned for their friends who died in heroism.</p><h4>What if Sinister Learned the Greatest Secrets of the Marvel Universe? (Earth-979)</h4><p>Rogue was a member of the X-Men along with her lover, Gambit. Following some events, Gambit betrayed the the team when he gave the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a> files to Mister Sinister. Gambit then returned and found Rogue furious with him for his betrayal. Gambit then proposed to her with a ring, but she declined. She then followed Gambit in his mission secretly so she could stop him. When a ceiling almost fell on them, Rogue was able to catch it, leaving everybody unharmed. Gambit told her that Mister Sinister had found a cure for Rogue's powers so she could touch anybody freely. Rogue tried to prove to Gambit that he was just being used by Mister Sinister. She kissed him, but unwittingly killed him when she absorbed his life force. She then conquered Sinister and revealed that everything that happened to them was just a part of some fantasy in a comic book.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h3>X-Men: The Animated Series</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"136444\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/136444-146674-rogue_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men: The Animated Series\"><img id=\"136444\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/136444-146674-rogue_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men: The Animated Series\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men: The Animated Series</div></div></div></div><p>Rogue's first animated appearance was in the X-Men television series, where she was one of the most important members of the X-Men. In this animated series, she had her absorption powers, as well as Ms. Marvel abilities. She has a love-hate relationship with Gambit throughout most of the series, much like when they first met in the comics, but also shows a more flirtatious attitude towards numerous other characters, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Archangel</a>, Colossus, and during the X-Men's appearance on <i>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</i>, she flirted with, and kissed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> (with his mask on). She is also depicted with a stronger Southern Accent than in other animated portrayals. During the series, Rogue almost takes the 'cure' which Apocalypse and Mystique secretly used to make mutants into their slaves. However, Rogue does not take the cure. She is also revisited by Cody, her first boyfriend, and almost runs away with him when she finds that she can touch him. She soon finds out, however, that he was part of a plot to have Rogue become the new leader of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a> (referred to here as \"the Family\"). She attempts to convince him to come back with her to the mansion to help reverse his transformation, but fails in her attempts, leaving her to cry on Gambit's shoulder. Rogue was also present when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a> had to take Professor Xavier up to space with her. Rogue was voiced by Lenore Zann.</p><h3>X-Men: Evolution</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"297338\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14624/297338-178832-rogue_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Evolution\"><img id=\"297338\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14624/297338-178832-rogue_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Evolution\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Evolution</div></div></div></div><p>In the series, <i>X-Men: Evolution</i>, Rogue is re-imagined as a rebellious, yet deeply insecure, teenager with a stereotypical goth appearance. Her powers make her cynical and reclusive, but truthfully, she is consumed by the desire to get close to the people around her. She was raised by Mystique and Destiny, soon being brought into the Brotherhood of Mutants, but left when she found out that they nurtured her to be a potential weapon. Rogue has a strong interest in <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, though her feelings for him fade soon after he and Jean start dating. She is then shown having an interest in Gambit when they first met, when he kidnapped her, and when she kissed him in the season 3 finale (while under <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mesmero/29-5065/\">Mesmero</a>'s control). This was one of only two kisses to be seen in the series, the first being between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> and a disguised <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a>.</p><p>Rogue's energy-absorbing abilities are very strong in this series, nearly driving her insane, but prove vital in the final episode against Apocalypse. Unlike in other universes, the powers she absorbs never totally fade, and at times, can still use a mutant's power (not always intentional) long after she had absorbed them. At times, she had more control over absorbed powers than their natural owner had (after absorbing Cyclops' power, she did not have to close her eyes). Although this Rogue did not have super-strength or flight abilities, she displays some skill in hand-to-hand combat. She is never shown gaining Ms. Marvel's abilities, but in Xavier's vision of the future, she is seen flying and not wearing gloves, suggesting contact with Ms. Marvel. Her accent is less pronounced than in the previous Animated portrayals and was said to be paired with Scott in this future. She was voiced by Meghan Black.</p><h3>Wolverine and The X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"706449\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35376/706449-rog_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine and the X-Men\"><img id=\"706449\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35376/706449-rog_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine and the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine and the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Rogue was severely distressed with Wolverine's departure. She stated that the Institute would not be a home for her without Logan. For that, she got mad at Logan. After a year, Logan went back with a mission to reform the X-Men after their temporary disbandment. During <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Kelly's</a> speech introducing the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>, a Sentinel detected Rogue and attacked her. Not even the men responsible for the creation of that Sentinel have full control of that which attacked Rogue. She was cornered until Angel and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> appeared to help her. Logan then appeared and defeated the Sentinel and asked Rogue to rejoin the X-Men. Rogue refused and told him that he would not be a good leader for the X-men and no one was going to rejoin with him as their leader.</p><p>That night, Toad was rescued by the Brotherhood from the MRD. After being freed, Toad confronted Rogue, totally annoying her. Toad then pulled her gloves away and Rogue accidentally absorbed his powers. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/domino/29-2161/\">Domino</a> and the rest of the Brotherhood apologized and asked her to join them because they think that if they do nothing, the humans would terminate them. Rogue became a valued member of the Brotherhood in some of their missions, striking up a close friendship with Domino, the only other female on the team. Rogue was also assigned to absorb the memories of Angel's father to learn the whereabouts of Senator Kelly in order to put an assassination on him. Thus, it ruined her friendship with Angel. Throughout her stint with the Brotherhood, Rogue and Domino bond, and swap their views on mutant kind. Domino is also the only one who treats Rogue as a human being, rather than a weapon, like Pietro. Pietro and Rogue are not very good allies during Rogue's Brotherhood stint. He treats her unfairly, and has a knack of annoying her. Eventually, Rogue comes to her senses, and betrays the Brotherhood, but not without answering to Domino. The ladies leave on bad terms, their last meet was with Rogue absorbing her powers and knocking her out. Rogue rejoins the X-Men, leaving Domino without an answer and the Brotherhood one member less. She helps Wolverine fight the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-samurai/29-3174/\">Silver Samurai</a>, and meets his former love, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mariko-yashida/29-3196/\">Mariko Yashida</a>. At the end of the first season, Rogue apologizes to Logan about doubting his abilities to keep the team together, and hugs him. Rogue and Logan have a father/daughter relationship in the show.</p><p>In Professor Xavier's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/days-of-future-past/39-44425/\">Days of Future Past</a>, Rogue is dead, and her once good friend Domino is second-head to the future X-Men. It is rumored that her friendship and death, are what led Domino to join Bishop and the others, becoming Days of Future Past's Future X-Men.</p><h3><b>X-Men Anime</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2172753\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108992/2172753-1951642_rogue_x_men_anime_2011.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Anime\"><img id=\"2172753\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108992/2172753-1951642_rogue_x_men_anime_2011_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Anime\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Anime</div></div></div></div><p>Rogue makes a cameo appearance in the X-Men Anime series.

In the second film, she has greater control of her power and can kiss Iceman for a few seconds, but any longer causes him pain. The third film shows her becoming jealous of Bobby and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>, who can touch without restrictions.

They celebrate the sudden reunion. However, Jaime notices that\nshe has an extreme cold body temperature. Layla mentions that they do not have any\ntime to throw away in explications right now. If Jaime wants to live, he needs\nto decide if he wants to go away with her. It is a simple decision; he just needs\nto reach her hand right now. As Layla starts the regressive countdown, Jaime\ntakes hold of her hand to be off to wherever this generated portal is going to take\nthem.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"746683\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/746683-001.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"746683\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/746683-001_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>They arrive in the future where Layla has been trapped\nfor years. Layla informs Jamie she has brought him 80 years in the future. The renewed Layla that Jaime was looking at John Madrox\u2019s residence was a\nhologram in 3D. It was a multidimensional projection of the real Layla that was\nthe main reason why Jaime could not sense Layla\u2019s body temperature. As the\nintense light materializes, they wake up in some kind of medical facility. Layla\nwas still pluged to a machine with cables connected around her body. A gigantic sentinel emerges\nthrough the ceiling. The sentinel is ready to fire a full bore laser blast towards\nboth of them. He tries to create a dupe to distract the sentinel but his\nefforts are unsuccessful. Layla and Jaime attempt to escape but it\u2019s too late\nagain. The sentinel has already locked on the target. It\u2019s ready to wipe them out.\nAt that dreadful moment, Layla confess to Jaime that he is the only person she\nwould like to die with.</p><p>As they are expecting the inevitable death; the sentinel\nexplodes. Her close friend Ruby Summers has come to rescue them. Ruby demands an explanation from Layla. Why\nis Jaime Madrox worth the effort of bringing him into the future? Both of them had already\ndiscussed the proper course of action, when they found that particular time\ntravel facility. As when this conversation is taking place, Layla predicts a second\nsentinel assault at their location. They struggle to escape but they are aided\nby Hecat\u2019e and Daemon, two members of the Summers Rebellion.</p><h3>Timely Events</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"807066\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/807066-001.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"807066\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/807066-001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The group arrives to a safe place near the coast. They are\nbrought to get together with an senior aged Cybernetic Cyclops and the rest of\nthe main Summer Rebellion core. The rebels are hiding in Atlantic City which is their headquarters and\ncentral base of operations. It\u2019s the perfect location to stop and to defend\nfrom incoming sentinels assaults. Layla joins Jaime for a long walk on the\nboardwalk. The sunset begins to set down, they argue about the reasons why they\nhave being a part of each other. They question their motives. Time has passed quickly\nwithout them doing what is necessary to be together. As they shout at each\nother, they drawn themselves closer and with each word they get really closer. Finally,\nthey kiss. As Jaime tries to break away, he gives excuses and reasons to\nrationally stop. Layla talks to him to calm him out; she explains that the good\nthing about being involved with her is that he does have to guess about\neverything anymore.</p><p>Later, they are reunited with Cyclops who asks Jaime to\ninvestigate the lost track of some members of the Summer Rebellion. Layla\nexplains that in their future it\u2019s impossible to lose a member during an\nassignment. The next day, Layla wakes up early and sneak into Jaime\u2019s room. She\nnotices marks on his upper body. She wants to know about the marks, they share\na moment of truthfulness as he explains the events of him reabsorbing Teresa\u2019s\nbaby. She attempts to console him. The whole situation is observed by Cyclops\nand Ruby who are at edge of the door. Cyclops mocks Jaime and tells him about\nthe first time he meet Layla. As they walk into the assignment, Ruby asks if\nLayla and Jaime had sexual intercourse. Layla refuses to answer, she recommends\nto her to take care of her own business. They travel to Detroit which is in ruins. The city is home\nof the only person who can provide the right answers to their questions.</p><p>They arrive to the Home of Victor Von Doom. He is a senior\nperson who has lost track of reality. He lives in his mind in the world that he\nused to live when he was younger but the current reality is totally different.\nHe is delusional. Layla intends to extract the information that they need.\nInstantly, he gets an interest on Layla who he seems to know from before. He\nremembers two things that she had told him before. He knows that they want to\nknow more about the time gaps. He demands that Layla knee in his presence to\nshow some respect. Layla plays along. Van Doom forces her to knee by bending\nhis hand but in reality Layla is just role playing along with him because Von\nDoom\u2019s advanced age is an impediment. He can not force Layla against her will using\njust his physical stamina. Ruby and Jaime notices her strategy. Victor Von Doom\nexplains that the only effectively way affect to change the future is to have a\nDoomlock. The device allows impacting any change of your actions in that\nparticular time stream. Layla asks him how she can get one. He explains that\nyou need to be a cybernetic organism to be able to use it because the\ntechnology has to be bound to yourself. Suddenly, Van doom remembers the second\nthing Layla told him before they meet which is an imminent attack. He screams to\nhit the deck for cover. The team does not have enough time they are surrounded\nby a new deadly type of a small versatile sentinel, the Omeganoid.</p><p>As they try to react, the Omeganoids disappear. Trevor\nFitzroy has come to aide them sending these sentinels to the past to battle with\nthe other members of X-factor Investigations. Madrox asks Layla if that is the\nsame well known criminal from the future. She gives details about that he is a\nrespected member of the Summers Rebellion in that reality. He also wants to\nknow why Layla did not reach for Trevor help to go back to their past. Layla\nexplains that Trevor does not have a proper handle of his time portals yet that\nshe could have ended in a different time stream. He acquired that knowledge to\nmanage his powers later in his life when he is a criminal. Jaime feels that\nsomebody needs to act to put Trevor in place before he can not hurt people in\nthe future. He can avoid a lot of people to suffer by doing something. Layla\nsuggests numerous ways to kill him but she was being sarcastic. He suggest to\nMadrox to stop whining about it. Trevor is a good friend right now.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1717663\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79250/1717663-x_fac_48_1.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1717663\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79250/1717663-x_fac_48_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Back in <a href=\"/atlantic-city/34-57770/\">Atlantic City</a>, Layla is walking on her bare feet on the beach\nwhen she is approached by Cyclops. He wants to know the reason why Madrox and\nher bring the senile Victor Von Doom back to the city. Cyclops is concern that\nVon Doom is the greatest villain of all times even when his mind is working\nhalf of the time. Layla explains that they need Victor Von Doom to build a\ndevice that will pull the Doomlock, a.k.a. Cortex out of the past to their\ncurrent time line to avoid he makes changes in the past that affect their\npresent.</p><h3>The Cortex Equation.</h3><p>Layla is concern when Jaime feels a deep pain in his chest.\nThat is a direct result of the battle that some of the members of X-Factor\ninvestigations and Cortex are having in the past to protect the life of Lenore. Layla presents information about a pending Sentinel attack in\nPhiladelphia\nbut this time the Summers Rebellion is ready to oppose the assault. Later as\nthe group celebrates the victory, Jaime inquires in relation to the cause why he\nwas brought there to that future. He feels that everything is going to turn at\nthe worst possible outcome anytime soon. Jaime asks Layla if he is the reason that\neverything goes horrific, she replies that he is one of the reasons, the other\nis her.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1225867\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/66206/1225867-x_factor_investigations___layla_miller_2.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1225867\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/66206/1225867-x_factor_investigations___layla_miller_2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Back at the headquarters in Atlantic City, Victor Von Doom brings Cortex\nback from the past under his direct control. Cortex attacks and kills Trevor\nFritzroy. Ruby counter attack sending him to clash with Layla at the beach.\nRuby requests Madrox to inform Layla that she is needed where the Trevor\u2019s body\nrests. Cortex tease Layla\u2019s powers since he feels that she can not hurt him. He\nmotions to hit Layla when Madrox intervenes as Layla runs away to aide Trevor. Ruby confronts her to use her true\npowers to save him. Ruby has seen Layla to revive butterflies and small insects\nback to life. Layla does not want to do it since there are huge consequences.\nShe explains that she can bring the physical body back but the soul is gone.\nTherefore, He will not have a conscience to distinguish the concepts of right\nor wrong. However, Layla feels that she has to bring him back. She accepts\nunder the one condition that if things do not work correctly she will take\nTrevor\u2019s life back since that is part of her power as well. Layla apologizes to\nTrevor in advance and revives him. Trevor rejoins the fight in time to avoid\nall mutants in that reality to be teleported out to a different time stream. He\nkills Cortex by draining his energy in a similar fashion to a vampire. He also\ncreated a time portal to send Eddie Falcone back to his past to fulfill his\norigins.</p><p>Jaime confronts Layla about her true nature of her powers.\nHe wants to know if she can bring people back from dead. He does not understand\nwhy she did not help Theresa, a.k.a. Banshee when she had the chance. He feels\nthat Theresa was in real pain with the dead of her father. She tries to explain\nwhy she brought Trevor back but as she is talking. Victor Van Doom creates a\nnew time portal to teleport them back to the past. Madrox emerges at the\nX-Factor Investigations headquarters. Layla is nowhere to be seen. She appears\ntalking to a younger version of herself back at the orphanage. Layla tells her\neverything about her past and future. She explains how reality works. She also\nimplants memories and data about events that going to happen in the next eighty\nyears. However, she leave some gaps of information so she could have an\nopportunity for free will since she does not need to know everything that is\ngoing to take place. She walks away saying \u201cwhat things people do to kids\u201d.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"996754\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/996754-121_x_factor_201.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"996754\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/996754-121_x_factor_201_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Later she is found to have been spending a little around a year with Doctor Doom.

She and Shatterstar save Siryn from being killed by <a href=\"/bastion/29-40568/\">Bastion</a>'s men. When they save her some men shoot at Layla, she reveals that she has some power gauntlet that stops the bullets.

Guido goes to take Monet back to bed, and Layla informs him that <a href=\"/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Rahne</a> was back and she sent her to <a href=\"/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a>'s room. Guido informs her that Shatterstar was up there too. Rahne and Shatterstar get into a fight that goes into the street, Rahne informs everyone that she is pregnant with Rictor's baby. As Rahne hugs Rictor Layla watches her, because she knows Rahne is lying about the father of her child. The team goes to Vegas on a mission. Layla joins and saves some humans with a force field that seems to generate from her gauntlet, she then uses the gauntlet to pull the team back from hell very easily. Shortly after Vegas, Jamie and Layla go alone on a mission where a demon was attacking a woman. In the end Layla ended up using an incantation to exercise the demon.

Guido was taken to the hospital, a doctor comes out to tell Jamie and the others that Guido has died, but instantly they find out he is alive and well the doctor doesn't know how, we see Layla hiding in the hospital room's bathroom.

Although Layla has claimed that she once had horns and could breathe fire, she may not have meant for this to be taken literally, as she is explaining to Jamie Madrox that she was an outcast and treated badly by the other children in the orphanage. In <a href=\"../../x-factor-/37-179202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Factor #50</a>, Layla revealed to Jamie that her true mutant power is to return life to the dead. However, the people she resurrects are soulless - hallow shells of their former selves, so she does not use this power often on humans, nor does she get any pleasure out of it. Layla does enjoy using her life-giving abilities on animals. The first person she is shown to resurrect is <a href=\"../../trevor-fitzroy/29-8300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trevor Fitzroy</a>, who originally was a good man and lover of <a href=\"../../ruby-summers/29-57040/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruby Summers</a>. Following his resurrection, the soulless Fitzroy becomes the evil man known to the X-men.</p><h3>Feigned Powers</h3><p>When the aged Doom sends Jamie and an older Layla back to their own time, Layla is at first sent too far back, meeting a young, pre-House of M version of herself. She implants this young version of Layla with a device that give her information about things which present-Layla has already experienced, giving her the 'power' to 'know stuff.' When asked what her powers were she almost always replied that she \"knows stuff.\" This lead to speculation on her power by several sources and the general consensus was that she had the power of precognition.</p><p>With her \"future history\" she seemed to be able to perceive almost any event's outcome long enough before it occurs to casually (and generally cryptically) warn people if she feels it is warranted. Her abilities were shown to have limits when she was surprised to learn that her abilities to understand future events are hindered when dealing with mutants that <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a>, mutants he has re-powered, and <a href=\"../../damian-tryp/29-40708/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Damian Tryp</a>. Several people have demonstrated that they've been 'invisible' to her knowledge of the future. Strong Guy was probably invisible to her powers for a while because he was hypnotized, and Nicole was because the Isolationist built her with a \"chaotic randomizing generator\". In actuality, sometimes she just has 'black spots' in the data download which prevent her from knowing specific details about events. Some beings, with similar knowledge or prediction abilities (like Damian Tryp), can actually cause events that she has seen to not come to pass. However, despite the details, Layla has a considerable knowledge of future.</p><p>Layla has knowledge of events that will happen, allowing them to evade them. She often placed herself and her friends out of harms way and her opponents into situations that would end badly for them.</p><h3>The Gauntlet</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1564896\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79250/1564896-layla_1_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1564896\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79250/1564896-layla_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Since rejoining the team as an adult, Layla utilizes a mysterious gauntlet in addition to her true and implanted powers.

This energy force field can be use in a variety of forms. She has demonstrated its use as a weapon and as a protective shield. As a weapon, it makes objects explode when they come in contact with the generated force field. As a shield, Layla is able to create a barrier around her to protect herself and others. For instance, she had used to repeal an attack with firearms. She was able to increase the radius of the shield to protect a small group of people from a river of red-hot lava. In addition, She used the gauntlet as a protective energy shield to rescue out of hell her teammates of X-factor during the Asgardian Case. It wasn\u2019t clear how the device worked. To exit hell involves a high degree of complexity. It appeared slightly easy for her to walk in and out of hell using the device.</p><h3>Mystic Art</h3><p>Layla has developed an interest in magic, spells and incantations. It\u2019s not clear if that is a direct result of her interaction with Doctor Von Doom.

The idea was born during the 1970's run of the live-action \"Incredible Hulk\" television series. The show enjoyed such success that CBS considered making a female Hulk spin-off series. If CBS had gone through with it, they would have owned the rights to She-Hulk. But Marvel got wind of their idea and acted quickly, getting Stan Lee to write the first issue of a She-Hulk comic book series, with artist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-buscema/26-3800/\">John Buscema</a> doing the pencils.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"712273\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34475/712273-sheulk_super.jpg\" title=\"She-Hulk in her original costume\"><img id=\"712273\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/34475/712273-sheulk_medium.jpg\" alt=\"She-Hulk in her original costume\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">She-Hulk in her original costume</div></div></div></div><p>She-Hulk has played many roles in her comics career. Her early portrayal in her solo series made her similar to her cousin Bruce, with her transformations brought on by anger, but when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morbius/29-6722/\">Morbius</a> cured her of a blood disease, she gained full control over her abilities. Her solo series ran from 1980 until 1982, after which she joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-avengers/49-2128/\">Avengers</a> #221. Following the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-super-heroes-secret-wars/49-3352/\">Secret Wars</a> mini-series in 1984, Jennifer then joined the Fantastic Four, replacing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> until he later returned to the team.</p><p>She-Hulk's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-sensational-she-hulk/49-4243/\">solo series</a> - beginning in 1989 - introduced a new aspect of her persona, that is her awareness that she is a comic-book character and her ability to break the fourth-wall. After this series concluded in the mid-90s, She-Hulk continued to be a reliable member of the Avengers, and appeared in two further solo series in 2004 and 2005. After the huge events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/world-war-hulk/39-42294/\">World War Hulk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fall-of-the-hulks/39-55979/\">Fall of the Hulks</a>, Jennifer is a key player in the life of her cousin and is beginning to establish a new life for herself alongside all the many new members of the Hulk family.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Start of her Superhero Career</h3><p>At first, Jennifer was unable to control the She-Hulk, just as her cousin Bruce could not control the Hulk. At one point, Jennifer had a mental block placed on herself to keep from changing into She-Hulk. However, she eventually was able to maintain her intelligence in She-Hulk form. She also began to come to terms with her dual persona, since she loved the confidence she had in her She-Hulk form. She even reached a point where she loved being the She-Hulk more then regular Jennifer Walters. Jennifer eventually comes to terms with both forms, feeling that she can offer society more between the two of them.</p><p>After fighting solo for awhile, she joined the <a>Avengers</a> upon the request of her friend the <a>Wasp</a>, who was the founding female member of the team. This was during the same time that the archer <a>Hawkeye</a> rejoined the Avengers. She-Hulk and Hawkeye had clashing personalities were always at each others throats, but during a battle with the <a>Masters of Evil</a>, she was unwillingly turned back into Jennifer Walters by the Radiation Man. Feeling helpless, she became depressed, but thanks to Hawkeye cleverly taunting her, she was able to become the She-Hulk once more. She continued to work with the Avengers up until the <a>Secret Wars</a>, when she became a temporary member of the <a>Fantastic Four</a>, replacing The <a>Thing</a> until he returned.</p><p>While on a mission with the Fantastic Four, She-Hulk attempted to prevent a deadly radiation leak on board a <a>SHIELD</a> <a>Helicarrier</a>. She successfully stopped the radiation, but afterwards it appeared that she could not transform back to her normal body. However, Jennifer happily accepted this as she loved to be in her She-Hulk form more then her normal human body. Eventually, it would be revealed that the reason she could not change back to her normal body was because she was psychologically blocking that ability. Jennifer would eventually be able to transform back into her human body.</p><h3><b>Returning to the Avengers</b></h3><p>After the Thing returned to the Fantastic Four, Jennifer voluntarily left the team and re-joined the Avengers. She also got a new job on District Attorney <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blake-tower/29-2467/\">Blake Tower</a>\u2019s staff. Jennifer would eventually learn that one of the workers there was a former Golden Age super heroine named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blonde-phantom/29-41880/\">Blonde Phantom</a>. Blonde Phantom was the reason that Jennifer gained a job on the District Attorney\u2019s staff. After a while she left the Avengers, returning only occasionally when they truly needed her. When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> went insane and killed many of the Avengers, she used her powers to cause She-Hulk to go completely berserk. She-Hulk went on a rampage similar to the Hulk and was unstoppable. She even ripped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> in half while she was out of control.</p><h3><b>The Civil War and Super-Human Registration Act</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1227513\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/53078/1227513-she_hulk_sensational__1_052_super.jpg\" title=\"She-Hulk and the Avengers\"><img id=\"1227513\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/53078/1227513-she_hulk_sensational__1_052_medium.jpg\" alt=\"She-Hulk and the Avengers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">She-Hulk and the Avengers</div></div></div></div><p>Jennifer registered under the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human Registration Act</a> and was pro-registration. However, Jennifer still gave legal advice to any side that needed it. Jennifer worked as a lawyer for a Superhuman Law firm and married <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-jameson/29-4456/\">John Jameson</a>, son of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">Daily Bugle</a> Publisher, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson</a>. In order to gain Jonah\u2019s blessing, Jennifer came up with a plan that would help Jonah sue <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a> for fraud. However, she revealed that her true purpose was to keep Jonah on a wild goose chase, since she had no intentions of actually suing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>. Jennifer was also the defense lawyer for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\">Robbie Baldwin</a> (Speedball), whose carelessness led to the reason for the Superhuman Registration Act going into action.</p><p>Eventually Jennifer discovered that her feelings toward John had been manipulated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starfox/29-7257/\">Starfox</a>, the Titan. She then separated from John. One of the ramifications of the SHRA is that She-Hulk has now been drafted as a SHIELD agent, and works on a squad dedicated to Hulk-Level threats. However, Iron Man and SHIELD have been sending Jennifer and her team in a wild goose chase, telling them to \"go after the Hulk\" when they actually aren't. After sleeping with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield-helicarrier/18-40700/\">SHIELD Helicarrier</a> went crazy and all the technology began attacking everyone.</p><p>She-Hulk had to go up against a bunch of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> Life Model Decoys (LMDs) that went insane. After everything calmed down, Jennifer was holding a severed head of the Fury LMD when it mentioned Bruce Banner. A curious She-Hulk decided to go to her old Superhuman Law Firm to see if anyone could decrypt the message. With Mr. Zix and some unknown outside help, Jennifer was able to discover that Tony Stark and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illuminati/65-40421/\">Illuminati</a> shot her cousin Bruce out into space. An angered She-Hulk returned to the Helicarrier and engaged Iron Man in battle. She-Hulk seemed to have the upper hand until Iron Man used an adamantium needle to inject nanotech, causing her to lose her ability to change into She-Hulk.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1198188\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1198188-182069_20120_crimson_fox_super.jpg\" title=\"Lean, Mean, and Evergreen!\"><img id=\"1198188\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9541/1198188-182069_20120_crimson_fox_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lean, Mean, and Evergreen!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lean, Mean, and Evergreen!</div></div></div></div><p>Now, a powerless Jennifer could only continue her old life as a lawyer. Ben Grimm let her stay at his apartment for the night, and in the morning, Jen was still uncomfortable waking up in her human form. Jen went to work at the Law Offices of Goodman to discover that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mallory-book/29-4949/\">Mallory</a> is going to defend the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/leader/29-7617/\">Leader</a> in his upcoming case. Mallory then slaps Jen with a subpoena, forcing her to testify about her radiation experience. On the day of the trial, Mallory calls up Jen to recall her emotions while she was in her She-Hulk form. This proves embarrassing for her when she realizes how many men she has slept with, even including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a>. Mallory continues with tough questions, determined to prove that the radiation forces people to do something they usually would not. Jen has begun realizing that she loved being in her She-Hulk form more then her human form. Eventually she would come to terms and be comfortable with her human form again.</p><p>The next day, John came back to Jen pleading not to annul their marriage. However, Jen wants to since their marriage meant nothing. Mr. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/recorder-zeta-9/29-6804/\">Zix</a> comes in and asks everyone to join him in the office. Zix reveals his true form as a robot and tells them that he only has a couple hours to complete his task. He needed to ask some questions to Jen about what she tried to do by trying to warn Hawkeye about his death. However, Jen finally learns that her plan worked, and Hawkeye is still alive.</p><p>Apparently, there was another Earth out there that is similar to real life, where comic characters live as regular everyday citizens and there were no superheroes at all. That Earth called themselves Earth A, (Earth A or Earth-712 was first seen in Fantastic Four #118) and they had discovered a way to interlope to other dimensions. The Jennifer Walters of Earth A decided to go on a vacation to Earth B (Earth-616 , the main Marvel Universe), since Earth A decided to allow their civilians to use it as a vacation destination. Jennifer of Earth A gets transported to Earth B and is then able to turn into the She-Hulk. She begins battling and defeats the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rhino/29-2126/\">Rhino</a>, however she eventually gets arrested for interloping dimensions, and is sent to a holding cell with other interlopers.</p><p>Jen of Earth B (who is still powerless because of Tony Stark injecting nanites in her) comes and reveals that she is going to be her lawyer. Trouble came up right away, and Jen allows She-Hulk of Earth A to go and fight. Afterwards, Jen decides to use She-Hulk to help gather up other interlopers. When they brought an interloping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, Jen gets into an argument with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a> about the nanites, and how it is permanent and cannot be undone. Afterwards, Jen and She-Hulk of Earth A went out for the night to drink and talk. Eventually Jen of Earth B decides that She-Hulk should stay in Earth B and have Jen go live in Earth A since she no longer has any powers. It is decided and agreed, and even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> gives Jen his blessings. Jen goes through the transporter to head for Earth A, however, Reed realizes that he could reverse her direction which will cause her atoms to match the one with Jen from Earth A. Jen, now with her recovered powers, decides to stay in her own Earth, and the Jen from Earth A realized that she missed her old home, and decides to return.</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><p>Hulk returns to Earth and he is very angry. Hulk defeats <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a> and demands Iron Man, Dr. Strange, Mr. Fantastic, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> to come face him. He arrives in Manhattan and battles Iron Man, defeating him easily even when he is wearing his Hulk Buster armor. The Avengers arrive and prepare to battle, and as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a> charges at the Hulk, Jen stops him and tells them that she will try to talk to her cousin first. Jen tries to calm down the Hulk, but he stands his ground, forcing them to beat him if they want to stop him. Jen gets a couple of good shots in on the Hulk, but he overpowers her and slams her head first into the ground.</p><h3>A New Job</h3><p>Jen, who now has her powers again, but no longer works for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-initiative/65-42781/\">The Initiative</a>, began a new career. Now working for the Freeman Bonding Inc. her job was to capture anyone who skipped out on their court date: pretty much a bounty hunter. In this new job, Jen works with a new partner. The two of them track their target to Minnesota and eventually Jen gets impatient waiting for their target to come out, and alerts her partner that she is going in. The two made a 20 dollar bet that Jen \"couldn't do it without turning green.\" She goes inside and captures their target easily. However, a cat startles her and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/absorbing-man/29-1779/\">Absorbing Man</a> (who was their target's cousin) grabs her neck and snaps it in half. Absorbing Man then heads for the RV that they were traveling in, to encounter She-Hulk jumping out. The two battle each other across town. She-Hulk is then ambushed by a tiny <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titania/29-4943/\">Titania</a>, who was shrunken by Hank Pym's particles. Titania invades She-Hulk's ears and begins causing havoc in there. Meanwhile, the Jen that got her neck snapped gets up while her neck was still out of joint. She captures their target and heads for She-Hulk. Eventually She-Hulk is able to defeat Absorbing Man and complete their mission. Later that night, as \"Jen\" is driving, She-Hulk comes up to the front to ride with her. It turns out that \"Jen\" was really a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrull/12-43139/\">Skrull</a> named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jazinda/29-48744/\">Jazinda</a> who was pretending to be Jen.</p><h3>Lady Liberators</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"824913\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/824913-thundra1_super.jpg\" title=\"Lady Liberators\"><img id=\"824913\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/824913-thundra1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lady Liberators\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lady Liberators</div></div></div></div><p>She-Hulk joined with super-heroines <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thundra/29-7235/\">Thundra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valkyrie/29-6809/\">Valkyrie</a> to form the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-liberators/65-46791/\">Lady Liberators</a>.

Their first mission was to travel to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marinmer/34-55975/\">Marinmer</a> to give earthquake aid, where they were confronted by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/winter-guard/65-22537/\">Winter Guard</a>. After an initial misunderstanding and a brief battle, the two teams worked together to help the devastated people. The Lady Liberators then sought out and battled the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/general-thunderbolt-ross/29-3457/\">Red Hulk</a>, though with mixed results.</p><p>After a confrontation with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lyra/29-27405/\">Lyra</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a>, Jennifer decided to find out the Red Hulk's identity. This led to a confrontation with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doc-samson/29-4315/\">Doc Samson</a> in which She-Hulk was captured. She was being held prisoner by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/intelligencia/65-56959/\">Intelligencia</a> but was released Lyra. She and Lyra fight Red She-Hulk who throws them off the Helicarrier.

Their first target is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trapster/29-4328/\">Trapster</a>.</p><p>After Lyra's first day in her cover at high school, Jen and Lyra next go after <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wizard/29-3287/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the Wizard</a>, who had purchased a large yacht and filled it with women in bathing suits. During the fight, Wizard's yacht crashes, allowing them to capture him. Wizard is then brought to a prison within Banner's Death Valley Gamma Base, where the Hulk convinces him to reveal the location of their next target: the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-ghost/29-2473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Ghost</a>. During the fight with the Red Ghost and his apes, Jennifer is knocked away, leaving Lyra to battle them alone. Amelia (a girl from Lyra's school who discovered her secret) is then found on the carrier by one of the apes named Petro, but Jennifer returns and saves her.</p><p>Their next target is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/klaw/29-3171/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klaw</a>. After receiving a message from Bruce, Lyra and Jennifer arrive in Switzerland and break into the base where Mad Thinker is helping Klaw get rid of his powers by transferring them into a creation called Byte. However, the process is stopped when Lyra starts destroying machines before she knows what they are. With Klaw's energy having nowhere else to go, an explosion destroys Mad Thinker's base. Outside the destroyed base, Klaw wakes up and attacks the Hulks, who soon overcome and defeat the sound powered duo.</p><p>Later on Lyra is at her high school dance in her human form when her boyfriend asks her to dance.

She also possesses an above average (but not superhuman) level of intelligence, and is trained in hand-to-hand combat as well possessing some martial arts training.</p><p>As She-Hulk her powers are similar to those of her powerful cousin, the Hulk. She has great superhuman strength, endurance, and healing abilities. Unlike the Hulk, she usually retains her intelligence and an ability to transform between Jennifer Walters and She-Hulk. Rather than being triggered by anger, she can change at will. This ability has been lost at certain points, leaving her either only as Jennifer Walters or only as She-Hulk for extended periods of time.</p><p>When transforming in and out of She-Hulk form, Jennifer gains and loses mass in the form of body size as well as additional muscle mass. When changing into She-Hulk, her body and hair also take on a distinctly greenish hue. Although the She-Hulk's strength originally remained at a set level and did not increase, later in her history her strength increases as her anger grows, similar to her cousin the Hulk. If she increases her strength level as Jennifer Walters, her strength level as She-Hulk will be vastly greater than it would be otherwise. She has used this to her advantage in the past, using weight training as Jennifer Walters to make her much more powerful than normal as She-Hulk. A side effect of utilizing this facet of her power is that in She-Hulk form her muscle mass increases, making her much larger.</p><p>As She-Hulk she is able to easily lift more than 100 tons. She is impervious to most forms of physical attack and possesses a considerable healing factor.</p><p>She has also gained the ability to perform the Ovoid mind switch, but as a byproduct of being She-Hulk, when she performs it she switches the physical characteristics and powers of the person in question instead of their mind. She-Hulk was able to punch <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doc-samson/29-4315/\">Doc Samson</a> to another state and defeat the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/champion/29-26081/\">Champion</a> with the power-gem. Also, she was able to lift the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>'s greatest working out mass with one hand and realize that she could beat <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a> easily in arm wrestling.</p><h2>Skills</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"194046\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/194046-167348-she-hulk_super.jpg\" title=\"The hottest lawyer ever!\"><img id=\"194046\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/194046-167348-she-hulk_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The hottest lawyer ever!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The hottest lawyer ever!</div></div></div></div><p>Even aside from her superhuman powers, Jennifer is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat, being personally trained by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>. She has displayed martial arts skills in her human form as well. Jennifer often uses her sex appeal to aid her in fights against male opponents. Jennifer is also a skilled pilot.</p><p>In addition to her fighting skills and her incredible strength, Jennifer is a very intelligent woman. She received a degree in criminal law prior to becoming the She-Hulk and is a highly accomplished lawyer. She usually practices law as Jennifer Walters, but sometimes appears in her more striking She-Hulk form when she wishes to make a more dramatic impression in court. Jennifer is one of the few super-heroines to have acquired a college degree in the Marvel Universe.</p><h2><b>Personality</b></h2><p>When She-Hulk first appeared in Savage She-Hulk, her personality was different from the current modern version. Back then, she was short-tempered, violent, and demanding.

He spent his childhood in a gang called The Rivals along with his friend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/willis-stryker/29-44388/\">Willis Stryker</a>. Lucas engaged in many gang fights with The Diablos, a rival gang. He also committed petty crimes and worked for a crime lord named Sonny Caputo.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1237420\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1237420-30978__2_page_17_8__122_648lo_super.jpg\" title=\"Origin\"><img id=\"1237420\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1237420-30978__2_page_17_8__122_648lo_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Origin\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Origin</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually, Lucas was put through the juvenile justice system and realized the pain he was causing his family. He changed his ways and in his adulthood, he joined The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nypd/65-57310/\">NYPD</a> ( New York City Police Department) as a police officer. Willis Stryker rose through the ranks of crime. Stryker's actions brought the anger of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maggia/65-26082/\">The Maggia,</a> a New York crime syndicate, upon Willis. The Maggia ordered a hit on Willis and he was badly injured, only to be saved by Carl Lucas. Stryker's girlfriend Reva Conners grows fearful of Willis' line of work. She breaks up with him and finds comfort in Carl Lucas. Willis then believes that Lucas is the one responsible for the break up between him and Reva. In revenge, he planted drugs in Lucas' Harlem apartment and tipped off the cops. Lucas is then wrongly convicted and imprisoned.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Luke Cage was created by <a href=\"/archie-goodwin/26-42923/\">Archie Goodwin</a> and <a href=\"/john-romita/26-7499/\">John Romita</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1121674\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35895/1121674-moore_luke_cage_super.jpg\" title=\"Power Man\"><img id=\"1121674\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35895/1121674-moore_luke_cage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Power Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Power Man</div></div></div></div><p>While incarcerated, Lucas grows angry and hateful towards Willis. He engages in jail fights and makes numerous failed escape attempts. Lucas, is then transferred to a prison on the coast of Georgia. Lucas faces racism from one of the guards named Albert Rackham. Lucas then volunteers for an experiment which will shorten his sentence. <a href=\"/dr-noah-burstein/29-3157/\">Dr. Noah Burstein</a> puts Lucas in an electrical field with a chemical compound, leaving him unattended for a moment. Rackham tampers with the controls, causing an overload. Pushed way past its original intent, the resulting incident empowers Lucas with super strength and gives him nearly impervious skin. Lucas uses his power to escape from the prison and later makes his way back to New York City.</p><p>Lucas then adopted a costume and the name Luke Cage and became a Hero For Hire, working for anyone who can meet his price. He set up an office in Times Square, and is eventually proven innocent and exonerated from his crimes. Luke then continues his work as a superpowered mercenary. He eventually runs into his old friend, Willis Stryker, now a Maggia agent who goes under the name Diamond Back. Luke Cage and Diamond Back have an intense battle but Diamond Back is killed. Luke then went on to face many foes such as <a href=\"/gideon-mace/29-33457/\">Gideon Mace</a>, <a href=\"/chemistro/29-42236/\">Chemistro</a>, <a href=\"/discus/29-10314/\">Discus</a>, <a href=\"/stiletto/29-2129/\">Stiletto</a>, <a href=\"/shades/29-11015/\">Shades</a> and Comanche over the years.</p><p>Cage was one of the first African American super heroes;</p><p>along with the likes of Black Panther. During the Civil War story line, he</p><p>compared the registration act to slavery, which is a vitally important theme of</p><p>Civil War and what it represented. However, his creation was criticized by some</p><p>for promoting racist black stereotypes; as he was initially involved in gang</p><p>crime.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Luke Meets Other Superheroes</h3><p>Luke Cage later did a job for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> and attempted to collect a fee from Doctor Doom after he failed to pay, becoming a close ally to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">The Fantastic Four</a> for a time. Cage was then hired by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> to find and capture <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>. Cage later got to know Spider-Man and returned Jameson's money. This led Jameson to bash Luke in his newspaper. Cage later met his future wife <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jessica-jones/29-2265/\">Jessica Jones</a>, also known by her hero name, Jewel. During a mission, Luke got tricked into stealing a suit of armor from Stark International. Cage later got the codename Power Man. Luke then began to associate with the team know as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/defenders/65-26333/\">The Defenders</a> he fought along side <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">The Wrecking Crew.</a> Cage later got a spot on the Fantastic Four when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Ben Grimm</a> (The Thing) lost his powers. Luke was later mind controlled by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/puppet-master/29-3799/\">Puppet Master</a> and was used to fight his teammates on the Fantastic Four. Cage later went solo and fought more villains including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cockroach-hamilton/29-35948/\">Dontrell \"Cockroach\" Hamilton</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/piranha-jones/29-33988/\">Ray \" Piranha\" Jones</a>.</p><p>Luke was later called to help out the Defenders against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/floronic-man/29-24969/\">Plantman</a>. He later began to complain that his working in their group was messing up his paying work. Luke was then paid by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nighthawk/29-4832/\">Nighthawk</a>, who gave Luke a steady paycheck for helping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/defenders/65-26333/\">the Defenders</a>. Luke remained on their team as a main member as a result. He later worked with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk,</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/samantha-parrington/29-63767/\">Brunnhilde the Valkyrie</a>, Nighthawk and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-guardian/29-7581/\">Red Guardian.</a> They defeated many threats such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/egghead/29-3797/\">Egghead</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/headmen/65-17793/\">Headmen</a>. Cage somehow felt out of place and later quit the team because he thought that he was not suited for teamwork.</p><p>Months later Cage's innocence in his drug charges was proven and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-bushmaster/29-27473/\">John Bushmaster</a> kidnapped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-noah-burstein/29-3157/\">Noah Burstein</a>, then began to blackmail Cage for his safety. Cage was later ordered by John to kidnap <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/misty-knight/29-1491/\">Misty Knight</a>, which led to Luke fighting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> (Danny Rand) from the city of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kun-lun/34-56104/\">K'un-Lun.</a> Cage talked to Rand and explained the situation, Rand and Cage teamed up to defeat John Bushmaster and save his friends. Cage later on would work for Misty Knight in her detective agency.</p><h3>Heroes For Hire Is Founded</h3><p>Luke and Danny Rand (Iron Fist) would later form a company called Heroes for Hire, they had an attorney named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jeryn-hogarth/29-23834/\">Jeryn Hogarth</a> and the business was managed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jennie-royce/29-34291/\">Jennie Royce</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"615497\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/615497-hero1il_super.jpg\" title=\"Both heroes meet for the first time\"><img id=\"615497\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/615497-hero1il_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Both heroes meet for the first time\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Both heroes meet for the first time</div></div></div></div><p>Although the streetwise Cage and the unworldly Iron Fist seemed to have little in common, they soon became the best of friends. Cage and Iron Fist had great amounts of success with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heroes-for-hire/65-23588/\">Heroes For Hire</a>, then earned a reputation and fought a vast amount of criminals such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/constrictor/29-2127/\">the Constrictor.</a> Luke and Iron Fist had their first mission where Iron Fist got radiation poisoning and Cage took him to K'un- Lun for treatment.</p><p>Cage had a relationship with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/claire-temple/29-13384/\">Claire Temple</a>, that did not last long. After this, Cage became involved with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/harmony-young/29-13383/\">Harmony Young</a>.</p><p>Luke and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> worked with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moon-knight/29-1493/\">Moon Knight</a>, however they barely helped in the larger issues which <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">The Avengers</a> were in charge of. Their friendship made a turn for the worst when S.M.I.L.E. used Cage and Iron Fist to join Consolidated Conglomerates Inc. Luke would later be accused of murdering Iron Fist while he was actually being impersonated by a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull.</a></p><p>Luke was now on the run and moved to Chicago and he was later cleared of the charges with help. Daniel Rand later appeared and wanted to start over with Luke Cage. Cage tried to locate his surviving family members with the aid of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dakota-north/29-3128/\">Dakota North</a>, but his brother kept moving his father around. Luke's girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/harmony-young/29-13383/\">Harmony Young</a>, was killed and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ghost-rider/29-4268/\">Ghost Rider</a> aided him in finding her killer. Luke's heart was no longer set on heroics and he later helped run The Gem Theater with his friend. Luke later rejoined Heroes For Hire for one last mission. Luke then went back to Heroics and joined a group called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-knights/65-40427/\">Marvel Knights</a>, but mere days after he joined, the group disbanded following clashes with the forces of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tombstone/29-3161/\">Tombstone</a>. Luke later decided that a return to basics was in order, he re-established his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heroes-for-hire/65-23588/\">Hero for Hire</a> activities, intervening in a war between Crime Lords, Hammerhead and Tombstone.</p><h3>Jessica Jones, The New Avengers and the Wedding Bliss</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"631464\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/631464-0011_super.jpg\" title=\"Danielle Cage\"><img id=\"631464\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/631464-0011_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Cage\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Danielle Cage</div></div></div></div><p>Luke later has a one night stand with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jessica-jones/29-2265/\">Jessica Jones</a>. Cage had a crisis later when Jessica reacted to the fling, however, her and Luke made peace and later worked together when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daredevil/29-24694/\">Matt Murdock</a> was accused of being Daredevil. Luke later told Jessica his feelings towards her grew and she told him she was pregnant. Cage and Jones moved in together and Jessica later became a superhuman consultant for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">The Daily Bugle</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> still hated Luke though, for denying the job of capturing Spider-Man previously.</p><p>Shortly after, Luke is hired by Matt Murdock to accompany him to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-raft/34-50736/\">the Raft</a>, a prison off of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rykers-island/34-55830/\">Ryker's Island</a> to visit <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Robert Reynolds, the Sentry</a>.

However, during the visit <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/electro/29-3228/\">Electro</a> stages a prison break. As <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> arrive to help maintain order during the ensuing riot, something unexpected happens. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">The New Avengers</a> form.</p><p>Following the riot, Captain America asks all the heroes to join, however Matt Murdock declines. Despite this, the team begins to pursue the cause of the riot, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/electro/29-3228/\">Electro</a>. After which they go to the Savage Land to find the real reason for the breakout, Karl Lykos, better known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sauron/29-3180/\">Sauron</a>. After a run-in with Sauron, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land-mutates/65-41180/\">Savage Land mutates</a>, and S.H.I.E.L.D. troopers (Led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yelena-belova/29-19397/\">Yelena Belova, the second Black Widow</a>), the New Avengers have some relative downtime in which they notice the continued presence of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a>.</p><p>The New Avengers (partially) were sent to deal with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecker/29-2252/\">Wrecker</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a>, who had escaped during the Raft riot. Cage, Wolverine, Spider-Woman, and Spider-Man fight Wrecker and capture him, sending him back to jail. They have no time to rest though as they go confront the Sentry in his house about why nobody remembers him. With the help of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic 4</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a>., <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, and the X-Men, they defeat Robert's dark side, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/void/29-11585/\">Void.</a> After this, the complete New Avengers help fight off a second <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a>- <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree-skrull-war/39-55742/\">War</a> with the Young Avengers.

The team ignores this and per Luke's request, visit Highland Park, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/detroit-michigan/34-55783/\">Detroit</a> on one of their off days, to help clean up a neighborhood of it's scum and villainy. The visit is cut short though, as the team has to run off to go fight the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/michael-pointer/29-7600/\">Collective</a>, a battle that they win.</p><p>During this time, two important things happen. The first is that Jessica has their baby, a girl that they name <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danielle-cage/29-50739/\">Danielle</a> after <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Danny Rand</a>, Luke's best friend. In addition, Luke and Jessica get married, which was officiated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/29-3115/\">Stan Lee</a>. However, the bliss was not to last, as the Senate was beginning to have talks about the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super Human Registration Act.</a></p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>Luke would later oppose the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super Human Registration Act</a>, along with Captain America and the Anti-Registration forces. Luke felt the act was like slavery and fought alongside Iron Fist, Captain America and the rest of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> until Captain America gave himself to the government and ended the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War.</a> Luke had sent Jessica and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danielle-cage/29-50739/\">Danielle</a> to Canada where they would be safe from the new law.</p><p>S.H.I.E.L.D.

Luke Cage and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> got together with a group of unregistered heroes, many of which had been on the anti-registration side. From here the continued <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-avengers/65-42520/\">The New Avengers</a>. The team, at this point, included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a> (she was secretly the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/queen-veranke/29-54514/\">Skrull Queen</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>.

Cage's Avengers and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a> fought many times in the ensuing months over registration. Luke often had trouble trusting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clint-barton/29-1475/\">Clint Barton</a> due to his past of criminal activities, however Cage was later proved wrong when Clint Barton had proved himself by taking out a group of ninjas single handed.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"631467\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/631467-0010_super.jpg\" title=\"Cage finding out his daughter had been kidnapped\"><img id=\"631467\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/631467-0010_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cage finding out his daughter had been kidnapped\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cage finding out his daughter had been kidnapped</div></div></div></div><p>The Avengers would later rescue <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/echo/29-9038/\">Echo</a> in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/japan/34-55746/\">Japan</a> and found out that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a> was a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siri/29-54515/\">Skrull</a> impostor. Cage became very worried about the Skrulls' powers to copy a person. Luke also had a theory there were more Skrulls on Earth. Many of the Avengers were not sure they could trust anyone and the team was betrayed by Spider- Woman, as it was The Skrull Queen.</p><p>Later The Sanctum would be raided by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">The Hood</a> and his gang. Cage moved to a new location with the team and thought Jessica had abandoned him with the child. Luke and his wife, Jessica, got into an argument and had many disagreements.

However, they also state that once the heroes are truly back on their feet, his reign would have to end and because of certain aspects that have changed about his personality and methods, they send Luke and Iron Fist to tell him how things are going to work out. When the pair arrives at Daredevil's stronghold they find him and his hand minions engaged in a heated battle with his arch-nemesis Bullseye. Luke and Iron Fist offer to back up Daredevil, but he turns them away because they will not swear their full allegiance to The Hand. Fearing that their friend's new direction will end terribly, they try to shut down the fight, but instead are forced to look on in terror as Daredevil takes matters into his own hands and brutally murders Bullseye.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As a result of volunteering for a chemical experiment involving AVX, Luke Cage possesses formidable superhuman capabilities. His physical attributes have all been enhanced to much higher levels. Cage possesses superhuman strength which allows him to lift up to 25 tons. He has considerable stamina which allows him to perform strenuous work without taxing himself for extended periods of time. Luke has nigh impenetrable skin, which can protect him from high caliber bullets, knife wounds, and powerful explosions. His durability is great enough for him to withstand blows from opponents possessing great superhuman strength. However, Luke's durability does not extend beyond his skin layer, as his internal body parts are not nearly as well protected. Thus, as he may be all but invulnerable externally, his interior parts can still be damaged if he is attacked with enough force. In addition to his heightened durability, Cage also has greatly accelerated healing which affords him the ability to recover from injuries and damage much faster.</p><h2>Abilities</h2><p>Luke is a skilled brawler and street fighter. He also possesses excellent leadership skills.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>Marvel Super Hero Squad</h4><p>Luke Cage appears in the episode \"A Brat Walks Among Us\" voiced by Lil' JJ.

Sam was his parents youngest child with older sister named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sarah-wilson/29-32510/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sarah Wilson</a> -Casper and a older brother named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mister-gideon/29-47101/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mister Gideon Wilson</a>. Sam's childhood started out a happy one during which he finds he has a natural affinity for birds. He takes up training pigeons, and has the largest pigeon coop in Harlem. In his teens, however, he encounters racism for the first time which leaves him frustrated, jaded, and disappointed.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1237469\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1237469-mc_ca_falcon_super.jpg\" title=\"Meeting Red Wing\"><img id=\"1237469\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1237469-mc_ca_falcon_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting Red Wing\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Meeting Red Wing</div></div></div></div><p>When he is 16, Wilson refuses to go to church, believing his deeply religious parents faith could be wrong. To his surprise, rather than put up a fight, his parents provide him with books on different religions and comparative theology. The next night, however, Sam's father is killed trying to break up a neighborhood fight. Two years later, his mother is shot and killed by a mugger one block from their apartment. Consumed by grief and \"angry at the world\" Sam became a respected community volunteer and social worker to try to better his community.</p><p>On his way to Rio de Janeiro, his plane crashed and he was later found by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a>. Using the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">Cosmic Cube</a>, Sam gained telepathic</p><p>communication with birds and created his Snap persona (this is a RETCON and a bad one at that since he had that ability in his childhood way before he met the Red Skull), the Red Skull turned him into the ideal fighter to take on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, but Cap was able to snap Sam out the Skull's control, and together they defeated the Red Skull.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>Sam Wilson made his first appearance in Captain America #117. He was created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gene-colan/26-3792/\">Gene Colan</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Back in America, Steve helped Sam become a superhero and they even teamed together on several occasions. Sam even took the identity and costume of Captain America. He worked hard to be a hero for the Harlem community, but a certain section of the African-American populace viewed him an an \"Uncle Tom\". Even his soon-to-be girlfriend, Leila would call the Falcon \"a yellowback\", not knowing he was really Sam Wilson. When Falcon helped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>, T'Challa rewarded him by giving him a costume with wings capable of flight. When Falcon found out that the Red Skull manipulated him and was the one that gave him powers, he joined up with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Sam took part in the \"Defender for a Day\", in which Nighthawk was trying to recruit new members. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Gyrich</a> recruited Falcon to the Avengers, so that the Avengers could be more \"racially diverse\", but Falcon didn't appreciate being the token minority and quit after a couple of missions.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1237488\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1237488-dc_260_79f21a944_super.jpg\" title=\"As an Avenger\"><img id=\"1237488\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1237488-dc_260_79f21a944_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"As an Avenger\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">As an Avenger</div></div></div></div><p>During the 1970s and 80's he was a dedicated social worker in Harlem, New York. He personally saved President Reagan from an assassination plot that he uncovered. He ran for a congressional seat but was beaten when his earlier criminal history as \"Snap Wilson\" was revealed. While working as a social worker, he often teamed-up with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sergeant-tork/29-15660/\">Sergeant Tork</a> from the N.Y.P.D. During this time Sam was mistaken by a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a> to be a mutant.</p><p>After Captain America gained enhanced strength from the side effect of a toxin used by the Viper, Sam felt inadequate to continue working as Captain America's partner. Turning to Black Panther for assistance, T'challa crafted a new costume for Sam which included glider wings which were powered by sunlight and linked to Sam's brain. He then returned to help Captain America clear his name after being framed for the murder of the tumbler by Moonstone.</p><p>After Steve Rogers had taken on the new identity of The Nomad, Falcon teamed up with the new Captain America Roscoe. Unfortunately Sam was brutally beaten and Roscoe was murdered by the Red Skull. When Rogers had retaken the mantle of Captain America, Sam joined him to face the Red Skull yet again. However this time it was revealed that the Red Skull had actually set up the meeting between Sam and Captain America on Exile Island. The Red Skull had actually changed Sam's persona and altered his memories. Sam Wilson, social worker of Harlem was actually Snap Wilson, notorious criminal charged with multiple cases of importation and sales of narcotics. During the trial the Stilt Man had attempted to kill the Falcon, but was thwarted by Sam and Redwing. Ultimately the judge placed Sam on parole with none other than Nick Fury as Sam's parole officer.</p><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a> storyline, wherein the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a> went insane, she reverted Sam back into the \"Snap\" persona. While he still continue to team-up with Captain America, his attitude become more of a nuisance and eventually Cap and Sam parted ways. Later, Captain America saved Falcon from being killed by taking a bullet meant for his friend.</p><p>In the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, Falcon joined up with Captain America's Secret Avengers. When Cap was incapacitated during a fight between the Avengers and the Pro-Registration Heroes, Sam took charge while Steve recovered. When Cap was assassinated, Falcon was one of the pallbearers in his funeral.</p><p>After that, SHIELD has assigned both him and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sharon-carter/29-38227/\">Sharon Carter</a> to investigate the assassination by locating Bucky Barnes</p><p>(who is still the Winter Soldier at the time) and tracking down the Red Skull (the primary suspect to the death of Captain America).</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Since his early childhood Falcon had a natural affinity for birds and could understand them. After the Red Skull used the Cosmic Cube on Sam he discovered he could speak telepathically with them. Sam has a paranormal empathic link with his bird <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/redwing/29-59930/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Redwing</a>. He is currently capable of having the same link to other birds. He is able to command the birds verbally and/or telepathically, and he can garner sensory information from them. Falcon's costume is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wakanda/34-41027/\">Wakandan</a> which consist of glider wings which have jet powered tips and are charged by a sunlight battery pack linked to Sams brain, a talon that he could use to capture enemies, and a mask that gives him sight in different ranges from night vision, infrared, magnification, and 360 degree view of his surroundings. He also has a glider system that employs 'hard light' wings that are created by a holographic projector.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-398</h3><p>In this reality Falcon was known as Blackbird and was a member of the Queen's Vengeance.</p><h3>Heroes Reborn</h3><p>In the Heroes Reborn universe, the Falcon is an old man that mysteriously remembers Steve Rogers as Captain America when no one else does. He posed as a cook to keep an eye on Captain America, but he was really Special Forces during the Second World War.</p><h3>Earth-1610</h3><p>Samuel Wilson was a member of the armed forces but retired to pursue a scientific interest, who served later with or under General Nick Fury, and wore a pair of metal wings. He appeared to be an accomplished combatant, especially when using the sharp edge of the metal wings he wore as a weapon. Wilson worked with <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Vision_%28Gah_Lak_Tus%29_%28Earth-1610%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vision</a>, demonstrating a high level of technological understanding.</p><p>Wilson later helped Vision and the cybernetic mutated <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/George_Tarleton_%28Earth-1610%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. George Tarleton</a> against a <a href=\"http://marvel.wikia.com/Gah_Lak_Tus\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gah Lak Tus</a> module. After the module was destroyed, Wilson comforted Vision of the events that have happened and gave her his keys to his home, if she needs a place to stay given that she doesn't have the power to return into space.</p><h3>Earth-717</h3><p>In this reality, the Falcon is a Native American who gave Steve Rogers his powers to fight in the American Civil War. He was later killed by Colonel Barnes, the White Skull.</p><h3>Earth-58163</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>, Sam is a detective and he doesn't appear as a superhero.</p><h3>Earth-9997</h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/earth-x/39-44571/\">Earth X</a> reality, Sam has been consumed and assimilated by the monster, Hydra. Using mind-control, the Hydra spoke to Captain America through Sam about joining them. When the Hydra was thought to have been killed, it merely retreated back to its base. Later, Captain America banished the Hydra, along with its mind-controlled heroes (including Sam), to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> using a neutralizer weapon. Sam's soul was later recruited by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Mar-Vell</a> to help defeat <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/death/29-12620/\">Death</a> in the realm of the dead.

At a young age, Jessica was lethally poisoned by radiation while living near <a href=\"../../wundagore-mountain-transia/34-41286/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mount Wundagore</a> in Transia. In an attempt to save her life, her father injected her with an experimental serum based on irradiated spiders' blood. Because the serum did not have any apparent effect on her, the man who would come to be known as the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Evolutionary</a> placed her in a genetic accelerator. While in the accelerator, she aged at a decelerated rate.</p><p>Eventually, HYDRA, under the control of <a href=\"../../otto-vermis/29-35357/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Count</a> <a href=\"../../otto-vermis/29-35357/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Otto Vermis</a>, found and recruited her as a HYDRA agent. They manipulated her, even going so far as to give her a fake boyfriend and then have him die. She was trained rigorously (and abusively) under Taskmaster. Through brainwashing and manipulation, she was convinced she was not human but actually an evolved spider. During this time, she went by the alias of Arachne. As a HYDRA agent she battled <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> and <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, until Jessica learned HYDRA's true nature. In the new re-telling, Otto Vermis, who had originally recruited her into HYDRA, was now instead an old, retired HYDRA agent who Jessica seduced in order to gain information to lead her to her mother. Other changes included that Jessica's father was never possessed by the spirit of the Sixth Century magician <a href=\"/magnus/29-7934/\">Magnus</a> which created some confusion over why Magnus, decades later, would help Jessica in many of her adventures.</p><h3>Other Spider-Women</h3><p>Several other characters have held the mantle of Spider-Woman. <a href=\"/arachne/29-16197/\">Julia Carpenter</a> appeared during the first <a href=\"/secret-wars/39-40978/\">Secret Wars</a> crossover and held the title for a while. <a href=\"/spider-woman-franklin/29-41988/\">Mattie Franklin</a> also acquired powers and became Spider-Woman for a time.

During this time Jessica was recaptured by HYDRA and brainwashed into working for them. This brought her into direct conflict with <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">Ben Grimm</a>. After HYDRA's brainwashing was reversed, she battled magical elements alongside the Thing and <a href=\"/mordred/29-19961/\">Modred the Mystic</a>.</p><p>Jessica battled Excalibur, an agent of <a href=\"/morgan-le-fay/29-13925/\">Morgan Le Fey</a>, and then came into contact with Morgan's arch nemesis, the sorcerer Magnus. Magnus would become one of her strongest allies, later providing information leading Jessica to relocate with him to Los Angeles and begin her career as a costumed crime fighter. While in Los Angeles Jessica encountered Morgan Le Fey's ghost and also tracked down her father's murderers. Jessica was pursued at this time by S.H.I.E.L.D. agent <a href=\"/jerry-hunt/29-13841/\">Jerry Hunt</a>, who followed her to Los Angeles, to begin a romantic relationship with her.</p><p>In her early days as Spider-Woman, Jessica chose to keep her presence in Los Angeles a secret.

Her search led her to the Hatros Institute and her first true job. Working as a secretary, she was able to gain free medical treatment to suppress her pheromones so that she could move effectively among people without producing any unwanted side-effects. Alongside the Shroud, she battled the above mentioned Nekra and the cult of Kali, and learned of her pheromone secretions. The culmination of her time at the Hatros Institute led Jessica to her encounter with <a href=\"/nekra/29-13896/\">Nekra</a>, and the loss of her job.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"921316\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/921316-76_new_avengers_59_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Woman and Spider-Man\"><img id=\"921316\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/921316-76_new_avengers_59_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Woman and Spider-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Woman and Spider-Man</div></div></div></div><p>Unemployed, Jessica briefly considered stealing, but at the last moment decided against it. She came into contact with <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, who advised her to use her unique talents to help others in need. Jessica chose to heed his advice and became a bounty hunter. She worked closely with former FBI specialist, <a href=\"../../scotty-mcdowell/29-34026/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scotty McDowell</a>, who later became the <a href=\"/hornet/29-4803/\">Hornet</a>. When their working relationship failed, Jessica moved to San Francisco with her best friend <a href=\"../../lindsay-mccabe/29-15723/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lindsay McCabe</a>, where she set up a practice as a licensed private investigator. On her first assignment, she battled <a href=\"../../siryn/29-3181/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siryn</a>, <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, and the <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> alongside the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>. She also battled Morgan Le Fey once again.</p><p>While working as a P.I., Jessica encountered the <a href=\"/viper/29-3420/\">Viper</a> and the Silver Samurai in a battle. Two main revelations came out of it. The first was that Lindsay McCabe finally learned that Spider-Woman and Jessica were one and the same (although Lindsay claimed that she had known all along). The other was Viper's claim to be Jessica's real mother. Whether this meant she was actually Miriem Drew remains unknown, but the resemblance between the two was uncanny and even fooled other HYDRA agents. However, the Viper was shown to be a pawn of <a href=\"/chthon/29-15683/\">Chthon</a> and ultimately betrayed Chthon rather than hurt Jessica. Jessica later encountered and battle the Viper again, although now the Viper believed that Jessica had brainwashed her into believing that she was her mother. Not long after that, Jessica gave up her immunity powers to save <a href=\"/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Giant-Man</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"204391\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9490/204391-91304-viper_super.JPG\" title=\"Viper tries to convince Jessica that she is her mother and that she should work for HYDRA again.\"><img id=\"204391\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9490/204391-91304-viper_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Viper tries to convince Jessica that she is her mother and that she should work for HYDRA again.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Viper tries to convince Jessica that she is her mother and that she should work for HYDRA again.</div></div></div></div><p>Jessica traveled in astral form with Magnus to the sixth century England to free her friends' souls in a showdown with <a href=\"/morgan-le-fay/29-13925/\">Morgan Le Fey</a>. She managed to vanquish Morgan, but Jessica's human body died while her spirit was gone from it. Jessica was believed dead and the sorcerer, Magnus, placed a spell over humanity to remove all traces of Jessica's existence. However, this spell was faulty, and <a href=\"/tigra/29-21188/\">Tigra</a> and the Shroud discovered Jessica's dead body and contacted the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>. It turned out that Jessica was in fact trapped on the astral plane, and was attempting to make contact with her body again. The Avengers and Strange traveled to the astral plane to battle Morgan Le Fay, who was also trapped on the astral plane. Morgan attempted to foil the Avengers' attempts to revive Jessica, bringing Morgan in direct conflict with both the Avengers and Dr. Strange. Eventually, Doctor Strange was able to reunite Jessica spirit with her human body and trap Morgan, but it was not without a cost: Jessica's bioelectric powers were eliminated and Magnus sacrificed his astral form to help restore her to life. Jessica was nevertheless grateful for returning to the land of the living, and abandoned her Spider-Woman identity. She continued her life as a private investigator in San Francisco, assisted by <a href=\"/lindsay-mccabe/29-15723/\">Lindsay McCabe</a> and occasionally by <a href=\"/tigra/29-21188/\">Tigra</a>, the Shroud and (during their brief time in the city) the X-Men.</p><p>Jessica Drew frequented <a href=\"/madripoor/34-42665/\">Madripoor</a> as a private investigator, partnered with Lindsay McCabe. During this time she had lost her ability to discharge bioelectricity, but found that her super powers were slowly returning. She still possessed superhuman strength and agility, and the ability to cling to walls.

Jessica began to regain her powers at this time while investigating two cases with Mattie, making use of her restored superhuman strength and agility. Although she regained the bulk of her spider-powers they were unstable. For example, her \"venom blasts\" worked efficiently in one fight then would fail unexpectedly on another occasion.</p><p>When Mattie Franklin was drawn into a highly abusive and parasitic relationship with a New York-based drug dealer who cannibalized her tissue to make the \"Mutant Growth Hormone\" (commonly known as \"MGH\").

Knowing Connely would kill her if she said no, Jessica agreed and contacted <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>, who confronted her securely and urged her to accept the offer. Nick offered to feed her selected safe information, allowing S.H.I.E.L.D. to use Jessica to research the HYDRA cell and take it down. However when she went undercover to regain her lost powers, she was ambushed by the <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> and replaced by their current Queen, <a href=\"/queen-veranke/29-54514/\">Veranke</a>, who took her place in the <a href=\"/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a> and assumed her role as Fury's spy in preparation for the upcoming <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Invasion</a>. In the aftermath of the Skrull Invasion, Jessica and many other superheroes were found on an orbiting Skrull ship by Iron Man. Sadly, Jessica's homecoming was rather cold, until her old friend Carol Danvers ( <a href=\"../../ms-marvel/29-21561/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ms. Marvel</a>) ran up to her and gave her a hug.

After fighting and killing a Skrull posing as Spider-Man, Jessica wakes up in a filthy jail cell, but refrains from breaking herself out with her powers. She is brought out for questioning and interrogated about her alien detector device. Norman Osborn requests she be taken back to the US for questioning.</p><p>She uses her emotion influencing power on the man, but as they leave, he is shot in the head. The assassination was carried out by HYDAR, specifically a group led by Madame Hydra /Viper who threatens to kill all the pursuing policemen forcing Spider-woman to follow along reluctantly. Viper wants her to rejoin Hydra, who know of her mission to hunt Skrulls through their inside connection to SWORD. Arriving at the Hydra base, Jessica tries to kill Viper, but fails as she's protected by a SHIELD force field.

Unable to fly, Jessica breaks her fall on a wire and crashes into a fountain. Back in hospital Jessica is taken and questioned again. She turns the tables on the detective using her fear inducing powers. However, this backfires as the guy is too terrified to tell her anything and crumples to the floor. As the police burst into the room, Jessica pulls on her costume and escapes to the roof, only to be confronted by the Thunderbolts who want to bring her back to Norman Osborn.

Jessica goes there and provokes Koru Kaviti into breaking cover, revealing himself to be a huge Super-Skrull. As they fight Koru tells her that Queen Veranke picked her to be her disguise because no-one really cared about her enough to notice. As the fight proceeded to go downhill for Jessica (as Koru was a veteran warrior regarded as fourth in command below Veranke), the Avengers arrived to provide assistance. At first, Jessica, in a warrior-rage, thought they were Skrulls. After coming to her senses, she managed to locate Koru, who had shape-shifted during the chaos. Wolverine then promptly impaled Koru from behind.

She has superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, agility, endurance and durability. As well as possessing the ability to focus the bioelectric energy that her body generates into \"venom blasts\" sufficient to stun or kill normal humans and adhere to almost any surface by excreting an unknown adhesive substance from her palms and soles. Jessica rapidly forms an immunity to all poisons and drugs and is totally immune to radiation. Her body also exudes a high concentration of pheromones which elicit pleasure in most human males while eliciting fear in most females, though she often uses a chemical \"perfume\" that can nullify this effect. She has also demonstrated superhuman senses in her solo series. Jessica has lost and regained her powers more than once, but she has recently emerged with her powers restored greater than ever.</p><p>In addition to her powers, Jessica is also a superb hand to hand fighter and has trained in several styles of combat, including boxing, judo, karate, and capoeira, which she learned under the training of the Taskmaster. She has also had training in fencing and the use of many other weapons, including most firearms. Jessica was trained by HYDRA and later on by SHIELD in covert operations, stealth, espionage, and information gathering, and she is also a superb athlete. She speaks several foreign languages, including Korean, Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German. Jessica also received vocational training in undercover detective work and sometimes carried a Walther PPK handgun.</p><p>Whilst not on the same physical level as some of the other Avengers, such as Spider-man, Jessica has shown to be more than capable of using her improved dexterity and reflexes to give more powerful combatants a very difficult time. During her time with S.W.O.R.D, she was locked in a chamber alongside a Skrull Warrior (albeit, it was malnourished and exhausted). She managed to trade blows with it, eventually coming out on top and killing it in the process. Koru Kaviti, the Skrull that originally captured her, on the other hand, was fourth in command below Queen Veranke and near the pinnacle of the Super-Skrull warriors. Jessica, out of costume, traded blows with Koru, holding her own in a losing battle. She took a variety of heavy hits, yet still refused to go down. The fight escalated, smashing through a bar and outside into the city of Madripoor. Whilst the outcome of the fight would most likely have ended in Koru's favor, Jessica held her own until the Avengers arrived, whereupon Koru was impaled by Wolverine.</p><h2><b>Alternate Universes</b></h2><h3>Earth-982 (MC2)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"571812\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8632/571812-spiderman3_super.jpg\" title=\"Gerry Drew, son of Jessica Drew, was the third Spider-Man.\"><img id=\"571812\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8632/571812-spiderman3_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gerry Drew, son of Jessica Drew, was the third Spider-Man.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gerry Drew, son of Jessica Drew, was the third Spider-Man.</div></div></div></div><p>In the <a href=\"/mc2/12-43721/\">MC2</a> universe, Jessica Drew was never able to regain her powers, which forced her to settle down and eventually get married.

With this recollection he realizes his arch-nemesis, the Void, is returning to this world. Reynolds immediately begins seeking out Marvel's most prominent heroes to warn them of the coming threat.</p><p>Various heroes' memories of Sentry were restored as Reynolds talked to them individually. <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a> had taken a photo of Sentry that had earned him a Pulitzer prize. Sentry had also flown countless times with <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> to help him overcome his fear of falling. And <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> had never forgotten Sentry, whom he only ever referred to as Golden Man. Sentry had helped Hulk keep control of his rage; later, this was revealed to be due to a calming aura the Sentry had, which helped the Hulk work to solely be a force for good and to gain public approval. The people eventually remember their own memories about the Sentry and his former sidekick, Scout. Most importantly, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a> remembers that he and Robert Reynolds had been best friends and that Sentry had often teamed up with the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> to fight the world's greatest threats. Over time the general public slowly remember the Sentry and the good he had done for the world.</p><p>During the course of an investigation into why the world had forgotten Sentry, Richards and Reynolds make a discovery: the Void and the Sentry are two parts of the same torn psyche, and the reason behind the world forgetting the Sentry had to do with Reynolds using his power to erase the Sentry from the world's memory, including his own, thus destroying the Void once and for all. With the heroes of the world united and waiting for the Void to come, Reynolds comes to the realization that he must make the sacrifice again. With the help of CLOC, Mr. Fantastic, and <a href=\"/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, he once again erases the memory of Sentry from the world.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Marvel promoted a limited series of <i>The Sentry</i> as an appearance of a forgotten Stan Lee hero of the Marvel Silver Age.

He had voluntarily imprisoned himself for the murder of his wife, <a href=\"/lindy-reynolds/29-13759/\">Lindy Reynolds</a>. During a jailbreak at the Raft, Sentry turns and defends several of the Avengers from <a href=\"/carnage/29-1490/\">Carnage</a>, who had beaten several members to a standstill. He easily overpowered Carnage, flew him into the depths of space, and tore him in two.</p><p>Taking a great interest in the now free Sentry, the Avengers begin investigating his dark persona. They soon realize that the Void is actually the result of a cerebral virus created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, who was under the direct employment of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-general/29-19360/\">The General</a>, a villain from the original Sentry story arc. This virus damaged the Sentry's ability to remember any facts of his life. In a cry for help and an amazing show of power, Sentry transferred his memories into comic book writer Paul Jenkins, who transferred those memories into a popular comic book series. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/1457/\">Emma Frost</a> released Sentry from the bonds of his virus, and he recalls much about his life, including that he never actually killed his wife and that his Watchtower stood atop Stark Tower, where he had hidden it from public view subconsciously all along.</p><p>With his memory reinstated, he joined with the Avengers and began fighting alongside them.</p><h3>Destruction of The Void</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1157559\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/61766/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035_super.jpg\" title=\"The Void\"><img id=\"1157559\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/61766/1157559-siege_3_legion_cps_035_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Void\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Void</div></div></div></div><p>Returned to the world, the Sentry captured the hearts of the public, newspapers referring to him as \"the Golden Guardian\", and he saved hundreds of lives on a daily basis; Reynolds' psychological problems, however, had worsened. Unable to reconcile that Robert Reynolds, the Sentry and the Void were the same being, the Sentry contained the Void in a vault in the Watchtower. At C.L.O.C.'s urging, Reynolds' psychiatrist Dr. Cornelius Worth entered the vault and found only a chair and a mirror. When Cornelius confronted Reynolds with this, Reynolds became confused and ran to the fairgrounds where he first gained his powers.</p><p>Cornelius followed Reynolds to the fairgrounds where the Sentry and the Void had been fighting. The Void claimed that Reynolds transformed into the Void rather than the Sentry, and that the Sentry was merely a guilt-borne byproduct of that transformation. With only half of Robert Reynolds' memories (the Void possessing the other half), the Sentry was not sure the Void was wrong. The Sentry chased the Void away and then explained to Cornelius why Reynolds had hired him in the first place. Reynolds subconsciously wanted someone to reveal the Void's existence to the world so he would no longer have to hide that aspect of himself. The Sentry told Cornelius that he knew all along that the Void was never in the Watchtower's vault. He knew that if Reynolds believed that he believed the Void to be in the Watchtower, the Void would be there. This kept the world safe from the Void for as long as the Sentry could keep up the charade.</p><p>The Sentry then reveals the true way he gained his powers. He ingested a super soldier serum developed in order to get high as a teenager. He finally reveals that he knew all along that the Void was not in the vault, but that as long as Reynolds believed so, the Void would remain dormant. The Sentry then visited Dr. Strange to determine if he was real or not. Strange tricked the Sentry into traveling to his old Professor's research facility where the two men confined the Sentry in an illusionary realm where he was a mental patient and superheroes didn't exist in an attempt to prevent any further destruction. The Sentry broke free of the illusion and after confronting the Professor who made the original serum, he traveled to Antarctica to confront the Void and discover what memories of Reynolds the Void has in his mind.</p><p>In the battle in the Antarctic, the Void reveals that the serum Sentry ingested was actually super-saturated, an exponentially more potent super-soldier serum than what created <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/1442/\">Captain America</a>. This was considered dangerous by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> because Sentry's blood could be used to create enough serum to power the entire world population; several attempts had been made on both the Void and Sentry to kill him. Enraged by this news, the Sentry flies into space and hurls the Void into the sun, claiming that he was no longer needed to balance out his acts of good. The Void swore to return.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the Superhuman Civil War, the Sentry sided with <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>'s Pro-Registration program. He accompanied a S.H.I.E.L.D. squad to battle <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> and told him that he didn't want to get involved but saw no choice - he claimed that he had to stop the ugly business even if that meant becoming part of it for a while. He then knocked Wolverine unconscious and handed him over to S.H.I.E.L.D. While trying to escape from a battle between the <a href=\"/new-avengers/65-42520/\">New Avengers</a>, believing that every path he could choose would ultimately lead to the death of people he knew, the Sentry flew to the moon. There he was confronted by the <a href=\"/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a>; believed a threat, he was ordered to follow them to <a href=\"/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>'s presence in the so-called \"Blue Area\" on the Moon. Then, after a discussion of the Civil War events with the (still unaware) Inhumans, he rekindled his friendship with them and almost resumed his past relationship with <a href=\"/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a>. He was then confronted by Iron Man himself, who finally convinced a still reluctant Sentry to join him, stating that he'll help <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, who is opposed to registration, understand that the world is changing. Three days after the climactic battle of the Civil War, the Sentry publicly announced his support of the Registration Act. Additionally, he was recruited by Tony Stark to be part of the <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a>, the newest incarnation of the Avengers team. He was identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes of the Initiative.</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2214291\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless.jpg\" title=\"Sentry vs World War Hulk\"><img id=\"2214291\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214291-world_war_hulk_vol_1_5_textless_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sentry vs World War Hulk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sentry vs World War Hulk</div></div></div></div><p>Sentry's watchtower, on top of Stark Tower, was destroyed when Hulk and Iron Man first fought in New York. Mister Fantastic made a machine that could duplicate the soothing aura Sentry used to calm down Hulk, but he wasn't fooled by it. All the while, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> and the President tried to call the real Sentry, but he ignores their plea.</p><p>After seeing Hulk on TV, deciding to force Mister Fantastic to kill Iron Man in a gladiator battle, Sentry finally decided to fly to New York to stop Hulk, remarking, \"It's time to play God.\" When Sentry arrived, he engaged the Hulk. He started to lose control and began to unleash his power on a level not seen before. So much energy was released during the battle that both the Hulk and Sentry reverted back to their normal human state and Bruce was able to knock out Robert with a weak punch.</p><h3>Post-Civil War</h3><p>After the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, Tony recruited Robert to the Mighty Avengers, the new incarnation of the Avengers. He was described as the most powerful member, but is inexperienced in using his powers. In a battle against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron</a>, this proves to be a draw until Ultron sends a virus to take down the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helicarrier/18-40700/\">Helicarrier</a>, after which she initiated an assassination of Sentry's wife.</p><p>Enraged and looking like the Void persona, Robert attacked Ultron mercilessly until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ares/29-11940/\">Ares</a> had to knock him out and let <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ant-man/29-6774/\">Ant-Man</a> introduce a virus in Ultron programming to shut her down. But Sentry would not relent on attacking Ultron, so much so that he almost decapitated her while the virus has not yet been completely uploaded, until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> knocked him out. After Ultron's defeat, Sentry rushed to his watchtower to see his wife alive and well. Later, Tony was shocked and terrified by Lindy's request to either depower or kill her husband.</p><p>When the Mighty Avengers confronted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a> for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/symbiote/12-42358/\">Symbiote</a> attack in New York, a time machine took Iron Man, Doom and Sentry back to the \"Silver Age\". Sentry goes to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baxter-building/34-41454/\">Baxter Building</a> to retrieve Mr. Fantastic's time machine in order to return to the present timeline. After knocking out the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>, the trio returned to the present and resumed their fight. Sentry then subdued Doom and took him in SHIELD custody.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2214320\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214320-2079294_avengers___copy.jpg\" title=\"Sentry joins the Dark Avengers\"><img id=\"2214320\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214320-2079294_avengers___copy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sentry joins the Dark Avengers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sentry joins the Dark Avengers</div></div></div></div><p>When the Mighty Avengers investigated a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrull/12-43139/\">Skrull</a> spaceship that crashed in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>, they discovered that inside the ship were some of the superheroes that could have been possibly replaced by Skrulls. When Sentry battled the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>, he transformed into the Void, who told him that the invasion was his punishment for wiping out everyone's memory. Sentry panicked and fled to Saturn in the middle of the battle, where he dealt with his fragile mind. The Skrull thought that the Sentry was most powerful and that the only way to deal with him was to induce a mental breakdown. When the Skrulls invaded New York, they attacked the watchtower, in which Sentry's wife was. When the Skrull was about to attack, Lindy was defended by Sentry in the form of the Void. He boasted to her that whatever the Sentry could not do, he could do as the Void. After the Invasion, Sentry was approached by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">Norman Osborn</a>; they talked about Reynold's mental issues. Osborn told the Sentry that the Void was just his imagination, and that he would help deal with these issues on the condition that he joined the newest incarnation of Osborn's Avengers, the Dark Avengers. Robert agreed.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2214322\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super.png\" title=\"Sentry beheading Morgan Le Fay\"><img id=\"2214322\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214322-901967_speed_sentry_super_medium.png\" alt=\"Sentry beheading Morgan Le Fay\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sentry beheading Morgan Le Fay</div></div></div></div><p>The first mission of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a> was to help Doctor Doom and the rest of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a> as they were under attack by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morgan-le-fay/29-13925/\">Morgan Le Fay</a>. As the Dark Avengers and Sentry arrived in Latveria, they saw Victor knocked cold on the floor. They saw Morgan and Osborn tell Sentry to go all out. Sentry easily ripped off Morgan's head. Sentry wondered if what he did was right or wrong, and Osborn told him that what he did was right. The Dark Avengers seemed successful in their first mission, as they defeated Morgan. Sentry started to scream and there was a big explosion. After it cleared, Morgan Le Fay was seen back and Sentry was gone. After Morgan's later defeat, the Dark Avengers headed back to Avengers Tower. As they arrived, there was a brilliant flash of light, and the Sentry was seen alive and well, hovering in front of his tower. Norman managed to calm down the confused Sentry.</p><p>The next time Osborn called upon Reynolds, it was in response to an Atlantean terrorist cell's attack on US soil. Reynolds was surprised when Osborn didn't ask for the Sentry, but instead suggested that the Void was needed to kill all but one of the terrorists in an act of vengeance. He countered, \"But you said there was no Void,\" and Osborn only repeated his request for what needed to be done. As a result, the Sentry performed the bloody task, leaving one to wonder if the Void was once again in control.</p><p>Sentry and the Dark Avengers went to San Francisco to quell the riots that were happening between humans and mutants. When the Dark Avengers and the Dark X-Men fought the X-Men, Emma Frost entered inside Reynolds' mind and released him from the Void's control, resulting in Sentry flying away from the battle. When Emma's hold over the Void was relinquished, it chased after Sentry, but left behind a small part of itself within Emma, trapped inside her diamond form.</p><p>When Sentry made his way to the Avengers Tower, he was shot in the head by his wife with a ray gun. He was later seen arriving at the end of a battle between the Dark Avengers and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-thing/29-4988/\">Man-Thing</a> in Louisiana. Sentry was sent out to an energy disturbance in a little town called Dinosaur, Colorado. Once there, he noticed a man in a cowboy hat and tried to get his attention. Suddenly, his hand began to glow black, almost as if on fire. Energy erupted from his eyes until he exploded. Osborn immediately assembled his Dark Avengers to find him.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2214302\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Sentry Overpowering Molecule Man\"><img id=\"2214302\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214302-1071548_1066614_darkavengers12016_super_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sentry Overpowering Molecule Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sentry Overpowering Molecule Man</div></div></div></div><p>Sentry was again shown alive, in what appeared to be a high school gym. On the ground, energy continued to emanate from him, even appearing to be dissolving, leaving him in great pain. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molecule-man/29-11880/\">Molecule Man</a> entered and spoke about how he had never experienced molecules like Sentry's, before he ripped him to pieces. He then appeared to disintegrate. Later, Reynolds reformed once again and confronted Molecule Man. He was able to stop him, have him restore everything back to the way it was, and banish Molecule Man. He then explained he realized the source of his power was that he could control molecules as well. Again, Osborn and the Avengers where both in awe and deeply afraid of his power. After witnessing his power, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstone/29-3279/\">Ms. Marvel</a> told Osborn that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch's</a> mental breakdown was nothing compared to what Sentry may do.</p><p>Sentry appeared to have escaped death yet again, when he appeared behind <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/noh-varr/29-11565/\">Noh Varr</a> claiming that Osborn needed to speak with him. A battle ensued in which Noh Varr began to shoot and throw cars at Sentry, which had little effect. Sentry claimed he didn't want to fight, but that Osborn claimed he wanted Noh Varr back \"dead or alive\". Noh Varr refused to go to Osborn, claiming that the whole Dark Avengers team consisted of criminals or the insane, to which Sentry claimed he was neither. Sentry was then blasted out of the sky by a girl using one of Noh Varr's weapons. He dodged the continuous assault of energy blasts and flew straight up through the clouds until a giant green explosion was seen from the ground. Sentry once again landed in the city, and was later joined by the rest of the Dark Avengers. When asked to find Noh Varr again, Sentry stated that he used to have an aura which was no longer present, so he couldn't.</p><p>Eventually, it was revealed that Osborn was able to awaken the Void inside of Sentry, and it slowly attempted to take control of his body. Claiming to be God, the Void was able to convince Reynolds to give up control of his Sentry form. He tried to cause massive chaos, but was reminded by Osborn that such actions could cause his own downfall, and so he once again calmed down.</p><p>As it was later revealed, the Void was Osborn's secret weapon, which he 'used' to wipe Dr. Doom out from the Cabal since he refused to join them. Later, Sentry found out that his wife, Lindy Reynolds, 'committed suicide', although it was revealed that Bullseye killed her and threw her out of the jet over the ocean near Los Angeles, as Norman Osborn ordered him.</p><h3>Siege on Asgard</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2214290\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214290-ares_vs_sentry.jpg\" title=\"Death of Ares\"><img id=\"2214290\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214290-ares_vs_sentry_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Death of Ares\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Death of Ares</div></div></div></div><p>Osborn, deciding to cement his power base over America, chose to attack Asgard under the guidance of Loki. As Osborn's secret weapon, Sentry was the first to attack the city, and even fought Thor. Ares became aware of Osborn's darker motives for attacking Asgard, and turned on him. Osborn sent Sentry on him; in the resulting fight, Sentry tore Ares in half.</p><p>After the death of Ares, Captain America and the Avengers arrived; Osborn's armor was shut down by Iron Man. In a final effort to win, Norman Osborn ordered the Sentry to tear down Asgard around them. When Osborn was finally taken down by Captain America and the Avengers, he revealed that he was the only person keeping Sentry in check. It now seemed that Sentry had merged with the Void.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2214271\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214271-1225602_siege01022_super.jpg\" title=\"Thor killing The Void/Sentry\"><img id=\"2214271\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/83594/2214271-1225602_siege01022_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Thor killing The Void/Sentry\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Thor killing The Void/Sentry</div></div></div></div><p>As the Avengers tried to mount an offensive against the Sentry, they were overwhelmed by his power. Loki, feeling responsible for all that he had done, used the Norn Stones to reenergize the Avengers. Recharged for battle, the Avengers took the battle right at the Sentry. Seemingly off balance, the Sentry realized that Loki was helping the Avengers, and in an instant killed Loki by ripping him in half. Having lost their edge, Iron Man used the SHIELD Helicarrier as a large bullet and ran it directly into the Sentry. The resulting explosion was of nearly nuclear level.</p><p>Battered and beaten, the Sentry reverted back to Robert Reynolds, and asked to be killed after realizing the damage he had caused. At first, Thor was reluctant and wished for Reynolds to pay for his crimes. When the Void began to regain control, however, Thor summoned a bolt of lightning with Mjolnir and delivered one final blow, killing Robert Reynolds and the Void. Feeling remorse, Thor took the remains of the Sentry and destroyed them by sending them in the sun.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"784766\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/784766-sentry_returns001_super.jpg\" title='\"Power of a million exploding suns\"'><img id=\"784766\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/784766-sentry_returns001_medium.jpg\" alt='\"Power of a million exploding suns\"' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">\"Power of a million exploding suns\"</div></div></div></div><p>The Sentry is one of the most powerful superheroes in the Marvel Universe. His own personal statements of his power often have him stating that he has the power equal to one million exploding suns. Spider-Man stated that Sentry fought <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a> to a standstill (very debated subject due to Spider-Man's penchant for satire and hyperbole).</p><p>Sentry's superhuman strength has enabled him to over power beings such as Ares, god of war, with ease, destroy Asgard by flying through the foundation, easily defeat Terrax, the herald of Galactus, and break his axe, and to engage an enraged Hulk ,whose power levels had increased beyond anything seen before. However, that fight resulted in both individuals reverting back to human form.</p><p>Sentry also possesses super speed. This allows him to perform such feats as catching a bullet and flying from the Earth to the Sun and back in a matter of minutes.</p><p>It has also been observed that Sentry has extremely heightened senses. This is evidenced by Sentry's statement that he could literally hear the heartbeat of a butterfly in Africa while he himself was still in New York.</p><p>Sentry is also one of the few super-humans to be considered <i>invincible</i>. Other than his fragile mind, SHIELD and even Iron Man have not been able to find any other areas of physical vulnerability. Given that he was revealed to have been carrying on an affair with Rogue he seemed to even be resistant to her powers.</p><p>According to Emma Frost, Sentry is one of the most powerful telepaths on earth. Once, he wiped the memory of every person on the planet of knowledge regarding his existence. Most of Sentry's mental abilities are used to maintain his physical form.</p><p>Under extreme emotional distress, Sentry can resurrect another being. This was first manifested when Sentry brought his wife back to life by just his touch. Originally, he was not even aware that he had this ability. He was shocked that he even had it. Even now, Sentry does not have full control over this power just yet. He could also emit a wave of radiation that can calm the Hulk down.</p><p>During the Civil War, Spider-Man and a group of SHIELD agents ranked Sentry as the most powerful of all Earth's heroes, with the Hulk ranked as second and Black Bolt ranked as third (It should be noted that at this time Thor was dead, so he didn't have a place on the list). While this arbitrary ranking is at best debatable (particularly given the events of World War Hulk), the Sentry is nevertheless one of the most powerful meta-humans on the planet, and has even been called by Norman Osborn as a \"living H-Bomb.\"</p><p>After being blown apart by the witch Morgan Le Fay, Sentry was later reformed at Avengers Tower under his own power. He was again thought to have been killed when his wife shot him with a weapon of Noh Varr and then twice by Molecule Man. After his last apparent death at the hands of Molecule Man Sentry came back realizing he could also control all forms of matter to a molecular level like Owen Reece could and was able to use his power to beat him with ease and then teleport him to an unknown location. He even firmly stated that he cannot die meaning he is for all intents and purposes immortal.</p><p>In one instance he projected the Void as an entirely separate entity, a giant monster. This could suggest some form of light manipulation and the creation of hard-light constructs, but can more likely be attributed to his control over matter.</p><p>As the Void, Robert has completely different powers. They can be seen on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/void/29-11585/\">Void</a>'s page. It is thought by many that Robert is even more powerful as the Void than he is in his Sentry incarnation.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3><b>Earth-2149: Marvel Zombies</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"264997\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/264997-131741-sentry_super.jpg\" title=\"Earth-2149 Zombieverse\"><img id=\"264997\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/264997-131741-sentry_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-2149 Zombieverse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-2149 Zombieverse</div></div></div></div><p>The infection started when a version of Sentry from an alternate universe, who was already a zombie. He first ate those who were ascending into heaven, until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ash/29-11302/\">Ash</a> confronted him and shot him in the face using his shotgun. Unfazed, Sentry punched Ash strong enough, that he he ripped through the fabric of reality, thus sucking both Ash and Sentry into Earth-2149. Warped into New York City, Sentry started looking for food. His first victims were the Avengers consisting of Colonel America, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> and Ms. Marvel, for they were the first at the scene of the crash site. Shortly after, the virus had reached every superhuman in the world, what happens to him after the world is consumed is unknown, but probably opened another hole on the fabric of reality and escaped.</p><p>Later another man called Robert Reynolds (THIS dimension's Bob, who seems to have no powers) appears as one of the fell survives with the acolytes, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a> (another uninfected hero) gives him the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a>'s head and alerted him to be cautious or he could be bitten. Years later an older version of him returns to earth in Marvel Zombies 2 (Wasp appears among on a suit designed by Bob which would be later used by Hawkeye too).</p><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies/65-15411/\">Marvel Zombies</a> attacked the Hulk, he reverted to Bruce Banner, and is put on analysis by Bob. Later it is revealed the Robert and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a> used T'Challa's son's body to host Colonel America's brain (but still he had problems to act as the original, but remained the fighting skills). This makes Black Panther attack both, but he is stopped by Colonel (who almost killed him, but was stopped by Bob). Eventually when the zombies return, the heroes (now with zombie Spider-Man and Luke Cage on their side) fight the zombies in order to prevent them from entering the space ship where the last humans remain.</p><p>While repairing Luke and Spidey's injuries (Spidey was ripped in two by Gladiator), Bob kisses Wasp and tells her how he truly feels about her. To the other hero's surprise, her feelings are similar.</p><p>While on watch, Bob is attacked by the zombie Bruce Banner, who had somehow managed to escape his prison. The attack made Bob accidentally open the force field, but he eventually escaped. Later the zombies realize their hunger is gone, but this is shortly interrupted when zombie Hulk attacks, attempting to feed on the humans. Though the fellow zombies tried to convince him to stop, Hulk did not listen a fight began once again. Though the zombies fought effortlessly, Hulk started to gain the upper hand and kills <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firelord/29-7108/\">Firelord</a>, Iron Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Phoenix</a> and Hawkeye. After these deaths, Bob arrives and sacrifices himself to the Hulk. Black Panther tries to stop him, but Bob says he didn't have reason to live anymore, for he believed Wasp was killed by Goliath, and it was the only way to get the Hulk to stop. After devouring Bob, the zombie Hulk reverts back to Bruce Banner, who then asks for the others kill him. The zombies agree in order to avoid another attack on the humans. Later Goliath (Henry Pym) is seen with the remains of Wasp (only a head now) and asks for Wasp's forgiveness. Wasp answers by saying he was the greatest man she ever knew and that he cared for everyone equally. Goliath just answers \"You always knew how to make me feel small\".</p><p>Note: the zombie Sentry that infected the world doesn't have any relation with Bob, who made a sacrifice to Hulk. The character was split by two separate personas.</p><h3><b>Earth-58163: House of M</b></h3><p>Sentry is seen in therapy with Dr. Strange as his therapist.

In his youth, Tony Stark was a precociously intelligent young boy. When Tony was 7 he was sent to a boarding school, and during this experience he found people difficult to relate to. This was when he became fascinated by machines. By the age of 15 Tony had enrolled in MIT (The Massachusetts Institute of Technology) in <a href=\"../../boston-massachusetts/34-56311/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Boston, Massachusetts</a>. He graduated at the top of his class at age 19 with double masters in physics and engineering.</p><h3>Stark Industries</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"739716\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/19940/739716-tonystark_07_super.jpg\" title=\"Tony Stark\"><img id=\"739716\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/19940/739716-tonystark_07_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Stark\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tony Stark</div></div></div></div><p>At the age of 21, his parents were tragically killed in a car accident. Afterwards, Tony inherited <a href=\"../../stark-industries/34-56006/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stark Industries</a>, an unparalleled mega-conglomerate that mostly manufactured weapons for the United States military. One of his first projects as the new CEO was to purchase the manufacturer who designed his parents' car and have the faulty brake system, which was seemingly the cause of their deaths, redesigned in order to prevent any further incidents, thus saving lives. Unknown to Stark, the true architect of his parents' deaths was a business move by Republic Oil (later renamed <a href=\"../../roxxon/65-56010/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roxxon Oil</a>). Lacking in business skills, Tony promoted secretary <a href=\"../../pepper-potts/29-4263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pepper Potts</a> to be his executive assistant and left the majority of his workload on her so that he could avoid what he saw as a burden.</p><p>During the Vietnam War (later retconned as the Gulf War, then later still as the war in <a href=\"../../afghanistan/34-55914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Afghanistan</a>), Stark was at one of his munitions plants testing new technology for the military when he was injured by his own land mine that lodged shrapnel near his heart. Tony was then captured by a local warlord named <a href=\"../../wong-chu/29-66473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wong-Chu</a> (a lackey of the <a href=\"../../the-mandarin/29-3530/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mandarin</a>) and forced under threat of death to create a doomsday weapon for him with another captive, the famed Nobel award-winning physicist, <a href=\"../../yinsen/29-7858/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yin Sen</a>. The shrapnel was working its way towards Stark's heart and slowly killing him, but he and the physicist created an iron suit in secret that would save Tony's life. The suit contained an iron chest plate with magnetic fields that halted the shrapnel in its place. Yin Sen then created a diversion, sacrificing himself so that Stark could put on the power armor in time and escape captivity. In the suit, Stark took on the warlord and his men and avenged Yin Sen's death, thus Iron Man was born.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Tony Stark made his first appearance in Tales of Suspense #39 in 1963. He was created by <a href=\"../../stan-lee/26-40467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Lee</a>, <a href=\"../../larry-lieber/26-4068/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Larry Lieber</a>, <a href=\"../../don-heck/26-6609/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don Heck</a>, and <a href=\"../../jack-kirby/26-5614/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Kirby</a>. Tony's character was loosely based on the life of the rich and successful playboy Howard Hughes. It may be argued that Iron Man symbolized the meritocracy of capitalism. In the 1960's when Iron Man was created, the threat of Communism from the USSR was huge. Not only did Iron Man fight communists and people from the Eastern Block, but he sent the message that great things could be achieved through thrift, risk and hard work, as opposed to Spider-Man's origin story a year previous whereby Peter Parker gained powers from being bitten by a spider.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>When Marvel re-emerged on the comic book scene in the Silver Age (some say Marvel's re-emergence signaled the beginning of the Silver Age of Comics) a big factor in their popularity was making easily relatable characters. In many cases, this took the form of a teenage hero for whom others felt some empathy (as at the time readership was primarily for those of a younger age.) Such heroes included the X-Men and Spider-Man. When it came to portraying more mature characters, there was still an emphasis on portraying the character's humanity as much as their heroics. In the case of Tony Stark, this took on essentially two different aspects. He had to battle alcoholism and re-organize his company so as not to be a war profiteer any longer. Over the course of his publication history, he has had to deal with both aspects of his life.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>After fleeing from enemy territory Tony met and befriended the pilot <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">James Rhodes</a> who had been shot down in his helicopter. By working together, they were able to make their escape and upon arriving back in the United States, Tony decided to continue being Iron Man in order to fight injustice. He believed that he had a limited amount of time left to live due to his injury, and therefore wanted to make the most of it. Therefore, he began making vast improvements to the technology of his power armor.</p><h3>Secret Identity</h3><p>When Tony finally admitted his double identity to his fiancee Joanna Nivena, she encouraged him to use the armor to become a super hero and save lives. Iron Man began to establish himself as one of the U.S.'s most eminent super heroes, but while halting a breakout of lions and tigers from a circus, Tony saw how his armor frightened the people he was defending. Asking his date Marion what she would do if she were Iron Man, Tony painted his armor in stainless gold. Tony Stark allowed the public at large to believe that he was no more than a rich playboy while his identity as Iron Man would remain a secret. Since Iron Man was often seen at Stark Industries, Tony circulated the idea that Iron Man was his personal bodyguard. Stark, of course, still had his heart condition which meant that any day could potentially be his last. Luckily for him, his heart condition became publicly known and he was eventually healed by way of an artificial heart transplant.</p><p>When testing his \"Stark Special\" race car, Tony wound up in a wreck, but was saved at the last minute by ex-boxer Harry <a href=\"../../happy-hogan/29-4262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Happy\" Hogan</a> . To repay Happy, Tony hired him as a chauffeur, although Happy became more like a bodyguard, resenting Iron Man. At the same time, former Stark Industries scientist Gregor Shapanka menaced Tony as <a href=\"../../jack-frost/29-35727/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Frost</a> (later renamed Blizzard), a villain who could generate ice. Happy would often try to play for Pepper's affection, but she was more interested in Tony. However, as Tony's heart could fail at any time, he didn't want to commit himself to a serious relationship since he could die unexpectedly. Happy remained extremely faithful to Tony, telling Iron Man straight out that if he had harmed Tony he would regret it during a period in which Iron Man was thought to have killed Tony. Happy even almost died when delivering a device to Iron Man that would stop <a href=\"../../titanium-man/29-13823/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Titanium Man</a>.</p><h3>Formation of the Avengers</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"181917\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181917-45469-avengers_super.jpg\" title=\"With The Avengers\"><img id=\"181917\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181917-45469-avengers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"With The Avengers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">With The Avengers</div></div></div></div><p>When <a href=\"../../loki/29-4324/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Loki</a> framed the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a> for wrecking a train in the hope that <a href=\"../../thor/29-2268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thor</a> would battle him, the Hulk's friend <a href=\"../../rick-jones/29-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Jones</a> sent a message to the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> asking for their help. Loki then diverted the message to Thor. What he didn't realize was that Iron Man, <a href=\"../../ant-man/29-6774/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ant-Man</a> and the <a href=\"../../wasp/29-1502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wasp</a> had also intercepted it. After Thor, the Hulk, Ant-Man, Wasp and Iron Man all defeated Loki together, Ant-Man suggested that the five of them stayed together as a team, and the Wasp dubbed them the <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a>. Shortly afterwards, after a fight with the <a href=\"../../space-phantom/29-7243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Space Phantom</a>, the Hulk decided to quit since he thought no one trusted him. Whilst in pursuit of the Hulk and <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> (whom he had teamed up with), the Avengers came upon the body of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, a legendary World War II fighter. The Avengers accepted him into their ranks, and he became close friends with Iron Man. Iron Man even gave Captain America transistors to control the flight of his shield, although Captain America later discarded them since they upset the balance of the shield. After a fight with the original <a href=\"../../masters-of-evil/65-7582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Masters of Evil</a> which ended with <a href=\"../../baron-helmut-zemo/29-3278/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Helmut Zemo</a> being killed, Iron Man, <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giant-Man</a>, Wasp and Thor all decided to quit for a while since they needed a break. Captain America stayed on and became the new leader of the Avengers, which now consisted of Captain America, <a href=\"../../clint-barton/29-1475/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hawkeye</a>, <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a> and the <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch</a>.</p><h3>Early Encounters</h3><p>When Tony was targeted by the mysterious villain <a href=\"../../mr-doll/29-39105/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Doll</a>, who was forcing millionaires to give their funds to him, he was completely powerless against Mr. Doll's power to cause pain using a mystic doll (similar to voodoo). In order to defeat Mr. Doll, Tony completely redesigned his armor into light fitting armor rather than his previously heavy and bulky Armor. With this new armor, he was able to defeat Mr. Doll in a rematch.</p><p>Iron Man initially fought primarily against enemies that were a threat to him or his company, such as <a href=\"../../the-mandarin/29-3530/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Mandarin</a>, The Melter, The <a href=\"../../ghost/29-17638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghost</a>, and <a href=\"../../spymaster/29-10222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spymaster</a>. He also fought against communist enemies (the 1960's, when Iron Man first debuted, was a time of unparalleled anti-communism) such as The <a href=\"../../crimson-dynamo/29-7234/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crimson Dynamo</a>, (the first of who would defect to the U.S.A. and later gave up his life to stop the second Crimson Dynamo) <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a> (who would later defect to the US), The <a href=\"../../titanium-man/29-13823/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Titanium Man</a>, and others. Iron Man was also one of the founding members of the <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a> and, with Tony\u2019s fortune, he was able to fund the team through the Maria Stark Foundation, a non-profit charitable organization named after his late mother. He also donated the use of his boyhood manor which became <a href=\"../../avengers-mansion/34-41036/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers Mansion</a>, staffed by Edwin <a href=\"../../jarvis/29-1781/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jarvis</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1247348\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1247348-iron_man_127_jarvis_super.jpg\" title=\"Demon in the Bottle\"><img id=\"1247348\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1247348-iron_man_127_jarvis_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Demon in the Bottle\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Demon in the Bottle</div></div></div></div><p>Over time, Tony evolved into a more complex and vulnerable individual as his dual life as a superhero caused him numerous personal problems. He became the victim of corporate takeovers and would lose and rebuild his fortune multiple times. Tony would also eventually be led to a dependency on alcohol when he discovered that <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a>, who he had previously supported, was seeking to buy controlling stocks in his company, thus ensuring his continued weapons development for them.</p><p>Later, Tony would become bankrupt and homeless when he lost his company to his rival, <a href=\"../../obadiah-stane/29-31197/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Obadiah Stane</a>, who had been manipulating him for some time. During this event, his friend James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes even took on the mantle of Iron Man. Stark would begin rebuilding his fortune when he created a company named Circuits Maximus, which specialized in computer technology. While this was happening, Rhodes was slowly going mad while using the Iron Man armor since its unique interface was designed for Stark's nervous system, and not his own. He eventually succumbs and goes on a rampage. This caused Tony to use a prototype armor that was not yet finished in order to stop Rhodey from causing any more destruction.</p><p>Following this incident, Rhodes repeatedly tried to convince Tony to resume the Iron Man mantle, who kept refusing. Now somewhat fearful of his past alcoholism, and how Stane had abused it, Tony felt that he had grown dependent upon the armour, whilst he had \"rotted\" on the inside. As a result, Tony didn't feel worthy of the high-tech armour which Rhodes used, and relied on a suit of armour which visually looked almost exactly the same as his original, grey armour (but which was much more sophisticated). As Tony continued fighting crime in this suit, Stane realised that Tony wasn't as beaten as he had assumed, and repeatedly tried various tactics to destroy Tony and make him sink into alcoholism once more. This all culminated in Stane kidnapping many of Tony's allies and friends, and bombing Circuits Maximus. As a result of this bombing, Rhodes was injured too badly to use his suit of armour, and Tony's friend <a href=\"/morley-erwin/29-31951/\">Morley Erwin</a> was killed. Obadiah Stane incorrectly assumed that as a result Tony would feel that he had failed, and take up drinking again to cope.</p><p>Instead, Tony finished developing a brand new suit of armor (nicknamed the Silver Centurion) which he had been working on for months, and confronted Stane face to face. Stane used his own suit of armour, which he called the Iron Monger, to battle him in response. Although Stane had layers of ways in which he planned to defeat Stark, Tony overcame each obstacle and managed to send Stane running. As a result, Stane killed himself by removing his helmet, and blowing off his head with a repulsor ray in his suit, as he had finally found a foe whom he couldn't defeat.</p><p>With so many people gaining access to his armor designs, Tony had to figure out a way to stop all the misuse of his armor technology. Tony would develop a way to disable the armors of everyone else who used technology based on his designs. Tony even disabled <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a> armors known as the Mandroids that he had designed for their use, which causes the US Government to go after Iron Man as public enemy number one, and a threat to society. Tony eluded capture by fooling them into believing that Iron Man had gone rogue. However, Tony's good friend both in and outside the armour, Captain America, wasn't fooled, and tried to persuade Tony from taking on the US Government. Tony pretended to comply, but in the end continued his crusade, even going so far as to electrocute Captain America once he tried stopping him physically. Although Cap wasn't hurt badly in any way, this created some friction between the two which lasted quite a while. Tony soon faked the death of Iron Man and claimed that a new person was now using the <a href=\"../../iron-man-armor/18-50749/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man armor</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"504217\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/504217-tony_stark_super.jpg\" title=\"Tony's Destiny.\"><img id=\"504217\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/504217-tony_stark_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Tony's Destiny.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tony's Destiny.</div></div></div></div><p>While Stark is continuing to use the Iron Man armor he discovers that its interface design was causing severe damage to his nervous system. He began remotely controlling the Iron Man armors, but after a failed mission against the Masters of Silence, he realizes that controlling the Iron Man armor is not as effective as being inside it. This leads to Tony designing the <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">War Machine</a> Armor, previously dubbed as the \u201cVariable Threat Response Battle Suit.\u201d His nervous system would continue to deteriorate however, even to the point where it was life-threatening. Tony had to fake his own death and be put into suspended animation in order to survive. Even close friends like James Rhodes were unaware of his faked death, and when he would later reveal the deception it would cause a serious rift in their relationship. Also during this time, James Rhodes would watch over the company and continue Iron Man\u2019s career by using the \u201cVariable Threat Response Battle Suit.\u201d</p><p>Of course Tony would eventually awaken and survive with a chip he programmed and implanted in himself. An enraged Rhodes takes the \u201cVariable Threat Response Battle Suit\u201d and begins his own career as the hero known as War Machine. Tony continues his super hero career and eventually gets into a feud with the Avengers after the <a href=\"../../kree/65-7588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kree</a>- <a href=\"../../shiar/12-43138/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shi'ar</a> War, resulting in him quitting the team. Tony would create a new group called <a href=\"../../force-works/65-14245/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Force Works</a>, but eventually left that team as well because of another falling out. In time, Iron Man would decide to reconcile with the Avengers, and he rejoins them.</p><h3>Death and Rebirth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"504216\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/504216-iron_man_003_super.jpg\" title=\"Life As Iron Man\"><img id=\"504216\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/504216-iron_man_003_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Life As Iron Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Life As Iron Man</div></div></div></div><p>Tony Stark was later revealed as an unwitting traitor to the Avengers while under the control of <a href=\"../../kang/29-2264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kang</a> the Conqueror, who had been using Stark as an unwilling sleeper agent for several years (later retconned into <a href=\"../../immortus/29-7215/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immortus</a> impersonating Kang and that Tony was under control for just a few months). Kang used Iron Man to kill many innocent lives and other heroes, such as <a href=\"../../rita-demara/29-1501/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rita DeMara</a>, and other Avenger teammates. The Avengers traveled back in time to recruit a teenage Tony Stark to fight the present-day Tony, and Kang. The teen Tony was able to steal an Iron Man armor from his older self and used it in battle against him. During the battle, the present-day Tony Stark would regain his memories and realize what he had been forced to do. As a result, he ended up sacrificing himself in order to kill Kang. The teenage Tony Stark would stay in the present time line following Iron Man's death, and continued his life as the new Iron Man. As for Stark\u2019s company, it was sold to a Japanese rival named Fujikawa Industries.</p><p>Unfortunately for the teenage Tony, <a href=\"../../onslaught/29-13352/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onslaught</a> arrived soon after, preventing him from gaining greater control over his life. In the final battle, many of the heroes of the Marvel Universe, including the teenage Tony, sacrificed themselves in order to defeat Onslaught. Luckily for them, <a href=\"../../franklin-richards/29-2469/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Franklin Richards</a> had created a pocket universe with all the heroes in it, and eventually restored everything back to normal, with Tony Stark restored to his normal adult age, but still retaining the teenage Tony\u2019s memories. Tony also gained the help of <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> and his law firm associate, <a href=\"/foggy-nelson/29-3124/\">Foggy Nelson</a>. They helped him regain ownership of his company and assets. Next, Tony reconciled with the Avengers and rejoined the team.</p><p>While trying to save an android by downloading its program into his power suit, the Iron Man armor was influenced by <a href=\"../../ultron/29-2242/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultron</a> who had embedded himself in the androids systems without the android knowing. Ultron used the armor to cause Tony to go into a cardiac arrest after a shock from villain <a href=\"../../whiplash/29-12709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Whiplash</a>. That shock awoke the suit and gave it a mind of its own. It knew that Tony was in cardiac arrest and saved him. Tony welcomed the live armor until it committed murder, and until it began wanting to merge itself with Tony, making him a human machine. Tony decided to battle the armor that had gained a mind of its own. During the battle however, Tony suffered another heart attack. The armor, which still cared about its creator, decided to save him and gave Tony its own cybernetic heart, replacing his own. This worked effectively but meant that Tony had to constantly recharge the battery power in order to keep his new heart functioning. After this incident, Tony decided to return to his original armor.</p><p>Tony would fall in love with a woman named <a href=\"../../rumiko-fujikawa/29-4264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rumiko Fujikawa</a>, the daughter of the man who had previously taken over his company. She only began dating him to rebel against her father however, and did not truly share his feelings for her. Due to the lack of any real intimacy between the two, their relationship soon became tumultuous, with Rumiko even cheating on Tony with one of his business rivals because she thought he had become boring. Strangely, Rumiko was murdered by an Iron Man impostor.</p><p>Stark would later reveal his identity to the world when saving a puppy from a speeding car since he was unable to completely mask himself in time. Afterwards, Tony discovered that the Government was once again using his technology, and was able to do so legally due to a copyright loophole that Tony exposed himself to by revealing his secret identity. Tony decided to accept a Presidential appointment to serve as the President's new Secretary of Defense so that he could monitor and direct the use of his technology by the Government.</p><h3>Avengers Disassembled</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"544136\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/544136-invim005_cvr_var_super.jpg\" title=\"Extremis Armor\"><img id=\"544136\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/544136-invim005_cvr_var_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Extremis Armor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Extremis Armor</div></div></div></div><p>During the <a href=\"../../avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers Disassembled</a> story, in which the <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch</a> goes insane and kills many of the Avengers members, she made Tony Stark confront the Ambassador of <a href=\"../../latveria/34-41031/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Latveria</a> while drunk at the <a href=\"../../united-nations-headquarters/34-56629/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Nations</a>. After this incident, Tony was forced to resign his duties as Secretary of Defense. Later, Stark claimed to be stepping down as Iron Man as well while someone else was stepping into the role, thus allowing him to continue operating as Iron Man in secret. Also during this event, <a href=\"../../avengers-mansion/34-41036/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers Mansion</a> was destroyed. It had been Tony's boyhood manor up until he donated it to the Avengers to be the teams base of operations. After its destruction, Tony built a new operational headquarters for the group which is now located in <a href=\"../../stark-tower/34-40830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stark Tower</a>.</p><p>After being seriously injured during a battle with an extremis-enhanced adversary, Stark calls upon <a href=\"/maya-hansen/29-50599/\">Maya Hansen</a> to inject his nervous system with a modified version of the extremis enhancile (a <a href=\"../../techno-organic/12-43631/\" rel=\"nofollow\">techno-organic</a> virus) in order to save his life. Extremis allows Stark to store the inner layers of the Iron Man armor in the hollows of his bones, and to control the armor through direct brain impulses. Extremis also integrates Stark's existing lockchip (a personal networking implement implanted in his forearm) directly into his nervous system. After this, Tony's abilities as Iron Man are significantly increased. He now has the ability to communicate with his suit faster than any human reaction time would normally be, making him much more powerful than before.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"650259\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><img id=\"650259\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/650259-imvscap_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Iron Man and Cap during Civil War\" /><div class=\"item-caption\">Iron Man and Cap during Civil War</div></div></div></div><p>It was revealed that Stark, in the days following the Kree- <a href=\"../../skrull/12-43139/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrull</a> war had formed a secret society or group called the <a href=\"../../illuminati/65-40421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illuminati</a>, which is a governing body of super heroes.

However, although the rest of the members had different\nviews and did not believe that an alliance like this would be of much use, they\nstill agree to work together and at least share information. In one case, shortly before the events of <a href=\"../../civil-war/39-40615/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civil War</a>, the Illuminati decided to launch the Hulk into outer space feeling he was too great a threat to civilization to be left alone, due to his constant rampages.</p><p>Tony would later discover that the Government was pushing forward with the idea of a <a href=\"../../super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super Human Registration Act</a>. At first, Stark is very much against the idea, even going so far as to hire the Titanium Man to attack him in order to manipulate public opinion in his favor. Tony also tries to talk the government out of Registration but his appeal is ignored after the tragedy at <a href=\"../../stamford-ct/34-45571/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stamford</a>, <a href=\"../../connecticut/34-56118/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Connecticut</a>, in which members of the <a href=\"../../new-warriors/65-11896/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Warriors</a> confronted a villain named <a href=\"/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a> in a residential neighborhood, setting off an explosion that killed many innocent lives. When the heroes unite in the face of this\ntragedy in Stamford , they move around some of the rubble to find if there\nare any survivors. Meanwhile, Tony tells <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> who has caught Nitro\u2019s scent\nto go after him. The trail leaves cold next to the water, but Iron Man lets\nWolverine borrow one of his suits to traverse underwater.</p><p>After the Stamford incident and another in which Tony's armors are hacked and used to attack innocent people, Stark reconsiders his position and the morality of super human registration. He reversed his decision and publicly spearheading the support for the Super-human Registration Act.

Tony also convinced Spider-Man to show the whole world his identity. They begin to hunt down heroes who on the anti-registration side who have gone rogue, led by <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>. Tony also worked with Mr. Fantastic to build a prison in the <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Negative Zone</a> to hold rogue superhumans, but many heroes begin to question the methods of Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic when a <a href=\"/ragnarok/29-47573/\">Thor clone</a> they created kills Bill Foster, the second <a href=\"../../goliath/29-3470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goliath</a>, a friend on the anti-registration side, the combined trauma of witnessing Foster's death, the firsthand view of the Prison 42 and a heated fight with Captain America causes Spider-Man to see the error of his ways. He publicly admits his mistake and joins Captain America's anti-reg forces much to Iron Man's anger. Further questions about their motives arise when it is discovered that they are using former villains to hunt down anti-registration forces. When the anti-registration heroes decide to attack the Negative Zone, it triggers the final battle of the Civil War. While Iron Man is facing off against Captain America his armor is shut down by the <a href=\"../../vision/29-1504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vision</a>.

The Illuminati lured the Hulk into a space-faring vessel and launched him into outer space in order to send him to a world where his power would not be a threat to the sanctity of innocent lives. The <a href=\"../../world-war-hulk/39-42294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World War Hulk</a> story occurs upon his return as the Hulk seeks revenge on Iron Man and the other Illuminati members.</p><p>Tony Stark is the first hero to confront the Hulk upon his return, hoping to prevent any further loss of life on Earth. Donning a modified \"Hulkbuster\" armor, Iron Man engages the Hulk in combat in Manhattan (whose population was previously evacuated to safety by S.H.I.E.L.D. upon Stark's orders). Iron Man makes an attempt to use specially designed nanobots to deactivate the Hulk's powers, but this proves unsuccessful due to the nanobots being sabotaged beforehand by a member of the Initiative. His new Hulkbuster armor and <a href=\"../../stark-tower/34-40830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stark Tower</a> are destroyed in the battle that ensues. While being held captive in Madison Square Garden arena, Tony Stark manages to contact <a href=\"../../dum-dum-dugan/29-3526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dum Dum Dugan</a> via his extremis enhanced powers and informs Dugan of a last resort plan to prevent the Hulk from attacking the rest of the world. The plan is to send the entirety of Manhattan into the Negative Zone. The plan would have the affect of killing himself, the Hulk, the <a href=\"../../warbound/65-43240/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warbound</a>, and all heroes and agents on the island. He trusts Dugan to know if and when he should execute the plan. Stark is later seen fighting with his fellow Illuminati members in the arena, defeating a gigantic tentacle monster. After the battle, the Hulk forces Tony and Mr. Fantastic to face off in combat via the obedience disks implanted into each of them. Mr. Fantastic defeats Tony, and the Hulk orders him to kill Stark. It was in that instant that the <a href=\"../../sentry/29-1454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentry</a> came in the arena and begin to battle the Hulk and after Hulk goes on a berserker rampage over the wounding of his friend, <a href=\"../../rick-jones/29-2248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rick Jones</a>, by his fellow Warbound, <a href=\"../../miek/29-43226/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miek</a>, Stark orders his satellite to fire a gamma inducing energy onto the <a href=\"../../hulk/29-2267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hulk</a>, thus knocking him unconscious.</p><h3>Murder Inc.</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/49-21487/\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073340\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073340-mayhem_super.jpg\" title=\"Mayhem in Philippines\"><img id=\"1073340\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073340-mayhem_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mayhem in Philippines\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mayhem in Philippines</div></div></div></div><p>Swiftly dealing with the entirety of the members of AGM, Iron Man faced their leader, <a href=\"../../modok/29-3709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">MODOK</a>, and had little trouble into dispatching him to space, and shutting down their operation. Concerned that all the members of AGM lacked passion, and zealotry, he was certain that they were not the ones behind the massacre. The prediction proved accurate once again, when, during an honorary ceremony in , another set of repulsor technology infused suicide terrorists, this time disguised as monks, caused mass destruction, and killed all the members of the country\u2019s heroic squad.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073336\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073336-evaluation_super.jpg\" title=\"Evaluation\"><img id=\"1073336\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073336-evaluation_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Evaluation\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Evaluation</div></div></div></div><p>Once there to investigate, Iron Man, War Machine and Pepper confirmed Tony\u2019s suspicions, with more clues that the technology was repulsor based, but also improving and growing at a significant rate. The man behind it all was none other than <a href=\"../../ezekiel-stane/29-54531/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ezekiel \u201cZeke\u201d Stane</a>, the teenage son of Tony\u2019s old adversary, Obadiah Stane (a.k.a. the <a href=\"../../obadiah-stane/29-31197/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Monger</a>). Who, with the use of cheap Stark based technology equipment he acquired from black market exchanges, was methodically trying to destroy Tony\u2019s operations from the root, and most importantly, end his Tony\u2019s life.</p><p>Putting the investigation for the culprit of the two suicide bombings aside for a while, Tony and Pepper attended a charity gala at Tony\u2019s penthouse in. After a small argument, Pepper stepped outside the building, with Tony coming after her. He was then stopped by Zeke Stane himself, who had managed to sneak in the building. Distracting Tony for a while, he achieved his true goal: another set of suicide bombers entered the building, and everyone inside was caught up in a huge explosion.</p><h3>Pepper Potts At The End Of The World</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/49-21487/\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073343\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073343-on_fire_super.jpg\" title=\"Man on Fire\"><img id=\"1073343\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073343-on_fire_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Man on Fire\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Man on Fire</div></div></div></div><p>Managing to activate the Extremis under sheath, and call his armor from the other room in virtually no time, Tony not only managed to escape, but also see the figure of Zeke Stane, sarcastically smirking at him, at the exact point of the detonation. Searching for Pepper, he located her through her Stark ID badge, buried under the debris. As he watched the ambulance carrying Pepper away from the scene, Tony was stunned to see another survivor: Zeke Stane himself. Tony was certain that Stane was the man behind the attacks, but had no substantial proof of it. Stane on the other hand, escaped the medical facility he was kept in after causing significant mayhem. It was revealed that Stane had undergone a procedure enabling him to store far greater amounts of energy to his body, and channeling the energy as a weapon through his hands, but the intense amounts of heat, caused his skin to burn out. As a solution, Zeke decided it was time to create a uniform in order to absorb and redirect the energy from his body.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073344\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073344-ready_for_the_showdown_super.jpg\" title=\"Ezekial Stane is ready for battle!\"><img id=\"1073344\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073344-ready_for_the_showdown_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ezekial Stane is ready for battle!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ezekial Stane is ready for battle!</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073349\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073349-uneasy_solutions_super.jpg\" title=\"Uneasy solutions\"><img id=\"1073349\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073349-uneasy_solutions_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Uneasy solutions\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Uneasy solutions</div></div></div></div><p>In the meantime, Tony was informed that Pepper\u2019s condition was critical \u2013 a shrapnel penetrated her chest cavity, and was closing into her heart. Adding the other injuries she sustained during the explosion, made an operation about the removal of the shrapnel, impossible. Determined to save Pepper, Tony awaited for her to regain consciousness in order to explain the situation, and offer her a solution: adding a derivation of the repulsor that kept him alive after his own accident years go, to her chest, to prevent the shrapnel from reaching her heart, while she was recuperating. Later on, Tony went to , where another explosion took place. At that time, and while giving Maria Hill insight about his past with Zeke\u2019s father, Obadiah, Tony started to suspect that Zeke had been using parts from his own original technology to achieve what he had done. Scanning the site for Starktech, he found one more damaged repulsor, what came to be Zeke\u2019s trademark, until that point. Tony\u2019s search came to an abrupt end after he was attacked by remote controlled androids, commanded by Chinese agents, while accused of unauthorized access. Defeating them without much trouble, Tony headed back to Pepper\u2019s side, where the doctor informed him that all went well. Little did Tony know that Zeke Stane had managed to complete his suit by that point, and was setting up the final pieces in order to retract his revenge against him.</p><h3>Neutron Bomb Heart</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/49-21487/\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073333\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073333-checkmate_super.jpg\" title=\"It's all part of the plan.\"><img id=\"1073333\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073333-checkmate_medium.jpg\" alt=\"It's all part of the plan.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">It's all part of the plan.</div></div></div></div><p>Tony then asked for confirmation that the various pieces of equipment found on land sites were originally created by him before being modified, and repurposed, from <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards</a>: Reed confirmed it, while the duo was playing chess on multiple boards at once. Tony knew then that his suspicion was correct all along: Zeke Stane needed him to complete his plans \u2013 he did not invent something for himself, he merely build upon Tony\u2019s tech. While continuing their game, Tony explained that he started learning chess in order to understand better Obadiah Stane, and eventually beat him in his own game. When Reed questioned him on how he intended to beat Zeke, a younger, dangerous and quite possibly smarter, opponent than him, Tony responded that Zeke was not smarter than he is: his attachment to original Stark was proof of that. His attacks in various sites had been escalating, just distractions and tests of his true cause. Before Reed could shape one final question, he came to realize that Tony had checkmated him on every single table, simultaneously. After doing so, Tony cryptically said that that is how he intended to beat Stane, before leaving the room. Intending to bail out Stane, and certain that he would, sooner, or later, be in need of his technology once again, Tony gave a piece of his original armor to a friend, a collector of superhero related items, with the instruction to immediately sell it on the black market. Tony had placed a tracer on the armor.</p><p>Once contact was made, and Zeke did buy the spare part of the armor, the tracer-tech went online, and was located by SHIELD. Noticing that the tracers pointed out to four different sites \u2013 Long Island, Valencia, Tokyo and Los Angeles, it became clear that Zeke Stane did not only intend to kill Tony, but also destroy the most crucial Stark facilities and cripple Tony\u2019s company, all in one blow.</p><h3>Code Black</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/49-21487/\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073365\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073365-zeke_super.jpg\" title=\"Zeke triumphant?\"><img id=\"1073365\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073365-zeke_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Zeke triumphant?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Zeke triumphant?</div></div></div></div><p>Finally, the day which Stane was waiting for arrived: with a squad of suicide bombers, he personally infiltrated Tony\u2019s company in , all the while he dispatched others to the other three key locations. Tony, fully aware of Stane\u2019s scheme, headed for , while ordering code black: the immediate evacuation of all personnel from each company. The one in occurred too late, though. Stane ordered the hit to commence earlier than anticipated, costing the life to fifty-eight people. Intending to put an end to Stane\u2019s actions, Tony entered the field while trying to pass unnoticed by Stane \u2013 only to find himself failing. A brutal fight commenced, with Stane slowly gaining the upper hand. Realizing that his opponent could very well be superior to him, Iron Man fought valiantly, nonetheless, only to find himself in the losing end, with Zeke decapitating him. Or did he?</p><h3>Irrational Actors</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/the-invincible-iron-man/49-21487/\">The Invincible Iron Man</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1073351\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man_super.jpg\" title=\"Painful Price\"><img id=\"1073351\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/43469/1073351-what_kind_of_a_man_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Painful Price\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Painful Price</div></div></div></div><p>Knowing that with the evacuations half completed, more lives would be at stake had Stane decided to order the other hits swiftly after the one in , Tony remotely controlled an empty armor to fight off Stane, while he was closing in to the facility himself. It was then that, in a stroke of genius, he proved what he meant in his earlier conversation with Reed Richards: He needed to be in four places at once. He needed to be an army. And by using the spare units in his armory, he did just that. Using the armors to contain damage, help in the evacuations, locate and prevent the suicide bombers from going off, and stopping Stane from giving the OK for the bombings to proceed, he handled every task at hand successfully. In the meanwhile, Stane, realizing he had been played, and gave the OK for the hits to start, while fighting off multiple older armors. It was at that point that Tony finally arrived at the scene, landing on top of Stane himself, and bracing for the final fight. Quickly immobilizing him, Tony asked him to cal off the hits, but Zeke refused. Holding yet another ace up his sleeve, Tony had planted devices in each location, to unleash electromagnetic pulses, and thus shutting down every piece of Stark equipment, from regular computers and advanced suits of armor, to even the suicide bombers. The fight continued without armors, neither for Tony, nor for Stane, with Iron Man finally putting Zeke down, mano-a-mano. With the entire crisis avoided, Iron Man could not help but think that Stane actually provided him with a fifth nightmare: what kind of a man he had to become, in order to stop his four nightmares from coming true, and the price with which those actions came to pass.</p><h3>The Mighty Avengers</h3><p>Iron Man as the Director of SHIELD is also given access to form a government\nsponsored Avengers team. He meets up with <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> and tells her that she\nis to be the team leader.

Thor defeats Tony and causes his armor to malfunction. He states\nthat he no longer complies to man\u2019s laws and that if Iron Man ever came to Asgard\nagain he would get an even worse welcome next time. Tony then asks him how is get back home\nwhere Thor tells him to walk.</p><p>In assembling the Avengers, Iron Man states that they need a \u201cThor\u201d and a \u201cWolverine\u201d\nto which Carol that she knows someone who is both a Thor and a Wolverine.

Afterwards a squadron of Skrulls attack. The Illuminati are forced to kill the Skrulls during the ensuing battle. In the aftermath, the Illuminati members realize they can no longer trust even each other since they cannot tell who is real and who is a Skrull importer. They go their separate ways, hoping to defeat the Skrulls on their own terms. Tony also wonders if Captain America during Civil War was a Skrull.</p><p>When an unidentified flying object lands in the <a href=\"/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>, Stark summons the\nAvengers to go and investigate. However, the unregistered heroes beat them to\nit and Iron man arrives just as soon as <a href=\"/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a> is about to open the door to\nthe spaceship.

Just when she is\nabout to kill him, Black Widow and Wolverine break in and save Stark whereas the\nQueen decides to retreat.</p><p>Black Widow injects the defeated Stark with a dose of adrenaline and\nquestions him about where his allegiance lies. He states that sleeper agent or\nnot, he doesn\u2019t believe in the Skrulls ideology and will fight against them.

Public opinion of Osborn changes into that of a patriot\nand a war hero whereas Iron Man's becomes synonymous to failure.</p><p>Once, the Skrull Queen is murdered, the Skrulls begin to lose faith in the prophecy\nthat states Earth to be their new home. They begin to retreat but many are\nthwarted by the Skrull <a href=\"/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a> who doesn't believe in their ideology and\nWar Machine whom is sent by Iron Man.

War Machine is\nable to safely transport them back to Earth.</p><p>Secret Invasion does not end without its casualties however and one of the\nmost notable Avenger, the Wasp dies while attempting to use the size changing\ndevice that the Skrull Pym gave her. Iron Man attends her funeral and gives a\nspeech honoring her memory and stating that far too many of their best have fallen in\nrecent years including Steve. Hank Pym, however, cuts Tony\u2019s speech short by\ninterrupting and stating that he is very much responsible for their deaths. He\nalso states why it is so that Tony hasn't died; Tony has no answer but feels his lost just the same. Finding this to be an opportune moment, Osborn also attending\nthe funeral offers membership to Hank for his new Avengers. Hank curses him out\nin public and leaves.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/dark-reign/39-55707/\">Dark Reign</a></b></p><p>In the aftermath of the Secret Invasion, S.H.I.E.L.D. is disbanded and replaced\nwith the agency known as H.A.M.M.E.R. Both Tony and Maria Hill lose their positions\nin favor of Osborn. On Tony's last day, Osborn questions him about the Superhuman\nRegistration database and how he could access it. Stark tells Norman\nthat he would be breaking the law and thus would need to get proper authorization\nfirst. Frustrated, Norman tells him\nto leave his office.</p><p>Later, Stark has a conversation with Maria Hill and Pepper Potts discussing\nwhat Osborn is up to. He states that he deleted the Registration Database from\nthe computers and that if Norman\ntries to access it all of his systems will get a virus. However, he tells that\nanother instance of the database exists within his brain and that he has a plan\nto get rid of it but needs their help.</p><p>Tony tells Pepper to put down Stark Industries and sends Maria Hill on an\nerrand to retrieve a jump drive from FuturePharm, a pharmaceutical subsidiary\nand then deliver its contents to Captain America.\nIn the meantime Tony works towards slowly deactivating his brain. Osborn calls\nfor Tony to appear in public and answer accusations that he throws at him, and\nthen for his lack of appearance issues an arrest warrant and order for H.A.M.M.E.R.\nto seize all of Stark\u2019s assets.</p><p>Before leaving for her assignment, Maria Hill has sex with Tony. When she\nwakes up, she finds a note from Tony telling her to blow up her armory and\nnotices that Stark has already gone off with one of his older suits. Meanwhile,\nPepper is frustrated about the state of the company and in her anger destroys a\nmirror only to discover a secret passageway leading to a secret armor that Tony\nhas designed for her. With the armor, Pepper escapes capture from H.A.M.M.E.R. and\nTony, Pepper and Hill, all three become fugitives on the run from H.A.M.M.E.R. and Osborn.</p><p>During his run, Tony is continually forced to downgrade his armor as he\nloses the skills to monitor his more advanced armors. He also stages a fight\nwith War Machine to make sure that Rhodey is not hunted, as well as runs into Namor who plans\nto deliver him to Osborn. Tony manages to escape and goes into Russia\nwhere the Crimson Dynamo (former enemy turned ally) buys him some time.\nFrustrated by Dynamo\u2019s denial to allow H.A.M.M.E.R. into his country, he sends Madam\nMasque who has a history with Tony to find and kill him. Masque finds him with\nPepper, whom she holds hostage with a gun on her head and asks Tony to tell her\nif he has ever loved her.</p><p>Tony stated that he used to but that he no longer does. However, since he has\nlost most of his memories he cannot recall enough of his past. While they are talking, Pepper manages to break free\nand tells Tony to run. They exchange a momentary kiss and Iron Man leaves Pepper as Rescue to deal\nwith Madam Masque.</p><p>Tony then finds refugee in Afghanistan\nand switches into his oldest armor. Norman Osborn finally manages to confront him and\nas the Iron Patriot severely beats him in camera. This changes public\nperception as well as what most of the heroes had thought about Tony. Doctor Donald\nBlake arrives to cure Tony\u2019s vegetable state.</p><p>Also during Dark Reign, Loki impersonated the Scarlet Witch and chose Iron Man to\njoin a new Avengers team. Although he helped on the first mission, he left the team\nand made Hank the team leader and wished him well.</p><h3>Stark Disassembled.</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/stark-disassembled/39-56032/\">Stark Disassembled</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"963112\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/963112-61_invincible_iron_man_21_super.jpg\" title=\"Stark: Disassembled\"><img id=\"963112\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/963112-61_invincible_iron_man_21_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Stark: Disassembled\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Stark: Disassembled</div></div></div></div><p>After the events of \" <a href=\"../../worlds-most-wanted/39-56031/\" rel=\"nofollow\">World's Most Wanted</a>\" , Tony Stark is beaten to within an inch of his life, thanks to the <a href=\"../../norman-osborn/29-58812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Patriot</a>, including a skull fracture and a concussion. The most serious issue is that he's in a persistent vegetative state. His body no longer knows how to breathe on its own. He is in a hospital, in Broxton, <a href=\"../../oklahoma/34-55803/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oklahoma</a>, on life support. Osborn wants to pull the plug and kill Stark, but he's unable to due to Tony having a living Will, which grants life or death decisions to his personal physician, <a href=\"../../thor/29-2268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Donald Blake</a>. Blake is at Tony's bedside along with Pepper Potts, Maria Hill, and <a href=\"../../bucky-barnes/29-40470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>. It is revealed that Stark 's body went into the vegetative state on its own, to prevent Osborn from getting any information from Stark, namely the identities of all Registered super-heroes, and the ever-exclusive Repulsor Technology. Stark pre-recorded a transmission into the <a href=\"../../pepper-potts/29-4263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rescue</a> armor, that details the steps needed on how to bring back, or \"Reboot\" Stark.</p><p>The first step involves taking the Repulsor battery out of Pepper, and into Tony. This is referred to as the \"Heart\" of the operation as the battery will fuel Tony's biology. The next step involves the data that Maria Hill recovered. The data was a hard drive that plugs into Stark's neck. Prior to upgrading to the Extremis armor, Tony backed himself on the hard drive. This serves as the \"Brain\" of the operation. The final step involves starting up the Repulsor generator. War Machine assists with the stripping of parts from the Rescue armor, specifically, the cables for channeling the Repulsor current. Tony is wheeled to the top of the hospital roof. The Shield of Captain America is placed near Stark , with the cables connected from the Shield to Tony's chest. Dr. Blake transforms into the Mighty Thor, and calls upon a lightning bolt on Cap's Shield. The Shield absorbs the lightning and the current flows from the Shield onto Tony. The operation is unsuccessful, and Stark is still in a coma. Afterwards, Captain America calls a consult, <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Stephen Strange</a> to offer his alternative methods.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside Tony's mind, we are given the image of a barren wasteland. Tony is trying to dig up something. He is joined by a couple , Howard and Maria. Every time Stark begins to dig, they are found by machines of his own design and they are blasted. Everything goes white, and the dream begins again and again, with Stark digging a little closer. Eventually, Stark and company are able to dig up an iron chestplate. Fearing the machines, they travel to a empty house. Tony puts on the chestplate, but nothing happens. Howard and Maria are found by the Starktech machines and are captured. Stark escapes capture by hiding in an underground bunker. He is then greeted by Dr. Strange, in astral form, who pledges to help bring Tony back , as \"the world needs its Iron Man\".</p><p>Considering Stark's current state a victory and no longer seeing him a threat, Norman Osborn orders <a href=\"../../the-hood/29-41917/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hood</a> and his gang to call off their hunt. <a href=\"../../madame-masque/29-13940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madame Masque</a> doesn't accept this and enlists the services of Thunderbolt <a href=\"../../ghost/29-17638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ghost</a>, to sneak in and pull the plug on Stark.</p><p>Dr. Strange continues to help Tony find himself inside his own mind, asking Tony to repeat the words, \"I am Iron Man\" over and over again. The two then journey to the bureaucrat to help Howard and Maria. Ghost then locates where Tony's body is being held, shooting Rhodey in the chest as he makes his way to Stark. Tony and Strange then run into one of the Stark sentries, Tony then ask if Strange was scared, which replies by saying that he wasn't actually there, and ask if Tony likes feeling afraid, which Tony tells him that he hates that feeling and fires off a Uni-Beam, destroying the sentry. Tony then looks at Strange, telling him \"I am Iron Man.\" Tony and Strange then make their way to a large complex, Strange then hears something like thunder and disappears. Tony then continues on, but runs into a group of people, who are walking in a pile of blood, that he knows, two of which were Happy Hogan and Yin Sen. Tony then makes it to the top, finding Howard and Maria inside, telling him to take a seat, that this is who they are, who he is, his legacy. Tony then tells them that he's not like them, not anymore, telling them that he chooses his own path, Tony is then consumed by a bright light.</p><p>Back in the real world, Strange and Maria try to hold off Ghost from killing Stark, but Ghost stabs Strange in the chest, and goes forward and begins to try to choke Stark to death. He is then stopped again by Maria, who he easily defeats, but Pepper Potts then claims that she is calling H.A.M.M.E.R. as they speak. Tony then wakes up, taking Ghost's \"Ghost Phone\" and tells him that he number to Stark Industries Seoul was 82-2-738-1059, saying \"It's funny the things you remember.\" Tony then uses the phone and sends Ghost to that number.</p><p>Captain America then arrives, asking Dr. Lisk how Stark was, Lisk then ask Cap if anyone knew how old that back-up Tony used to reboot himself was, saying that there's data missing. That when he talked to Stark, he told him that Cap was back, but didn't specifically say he had died, he then tells Captain America that there are simply things Tony Stark doesn't know. Pepper and Maria then find Tony on the computer, looking up things from the Civil War to Captain America's assassination, and about other recent things, shocked by what he is learning.</p><h3>Siege</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/siege/39-55985/\">Siege</a></b></p><p>Tony Stark was recovering from his reboot in Broxton, Oklahoma under the care of Dr Donald Blake when Norman Osborn's strike force assaulted the floating city of Asgard. When <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a> showed up to fight Osborn, the young avenger <a href=\"../../speed/29-40518/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Speed</a> ran to deliver Tony's armor to him.</p><p>After donning an older Iron Man suit Tony arrives at the battle and permanently shuts down the Iron Patriot armor that Osborn had stolen from him. After the arrival of the <a href=\"../../void/29-11585/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Void</a>, Tony used his armor to crash the HAMMER Helicarrier into the <a href=\"../../sentry/29-1454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentry</a>/Void, reverting him to Bob Reynolds. This gives Thor the break he needed to bring down the Void for good. during the aftermath, Tony stops <a href=\"../../moonstone/29-3279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moonstone</a> from escaping and oversees the imprisonment of Norman Osborn.</p><h3>Resilient</h3><p><b>For More Information: <a href=\"/stark-resilient/39-56153/\">Stark Resilient</a></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1212903\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39876/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038_super.jpg\" title=\"Bleeding Edge armor\"><img id=\"1212903\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39876/1212903-invincible_iron_man_v5_025_038_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Bleeding Edge armor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Bleeding Edge armor</div></div></div></div><p>After his reboot Tony, now with no company, decides to start a new company named Stark Resilient. Thor offers to give him treasures to fund his new venture, however he rejects it hoping to start from scratch. After working with Reed Richards on his new upgraded suit he pulls Stark from making government weapons.</p><p>Pepper becomes his new CEO and informs business men that he wants to use his Repulsor technology to change the world and remove the need for oil and other fossil fuels. However he tells them that if that don't get on board he will ruin them. Angered by this Peppers has a helicopter leave Tony forcing him to use his new armor.</p><p>Meanwhile the Hammer girls <a href=\"../../sasha-hammer/29-70802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sasha Hammer</a> and <a href=\"../../crimson-cowl/29-22613/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justine Hammer</a> plan to fill in the gap in military technology left by Stark Industries with their own <a href=\"../../detroit-steel/29-70306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detroit Steel</a>, and not in a nice way. To make sure that Stark's new company doesn't get in their way, they hire <a href=\"../../spymaster/29-10222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spymaster</a> to kill Stark Resilient while it's still in its crib. They also buy and sell old Stark Tech and H.A.M.M.E.R. weaponry and use some of it to fake a terrorist attack in <a href=\"../../tokyo/34-55973/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tokyo</a> so their <a href=\"../../detroit-steel/29-70306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Detroit Steel</a> could \"defeat\" these terrorists and come out victorious. Meanwhile making Iron Man and <a href=\"../../war-machine/29-1926/\" rel=\"nofollow\">War Machine</a>, who flew over there to see what 's going on, look ridiculous in front of the cameras. Although they do not come home empty-handed: Tony recognized the youngest Hammer girl, Sasha, as an accomplice to <a href=\"../../ezekiel-stane/29-54531/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ezekiel Stane</a> who destroyed Stark Industries and nearly killed Tony.</p><p>Meanwhile at the home front Stark Resilient has gathered a few misplaced geniuses to build him an Electric race car working on Repulsor technology from scratch in six weeks. And Pepper Pots wants her own repulsor disc back in her chest and an armor suit to become the heroine <a href=\"../../pepper-potts/29-4263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rescue</a> once again. Tony is initially against this, but it seems he promised her this before his mind-wipe, so he does what she asks and Pepper becomes Rescue once again. Tony hosts a gala in name of Stark Resilient and invites both Hammer girls. After an appearance together with Pepper, Tony takes off with Sasha Hammer.</p><h3>Heroic Age and Fear Itself</h3><p>In the aftermath of Siege, the super human registration act\nwas repealed thanks to the efforts of Steve Rogers, who now took over the\nposition of the overthrown Norman Osborn. Iron Man reunited with Thor and\nSteve Rogers and rekindled their relationship while setting their past differences aside. Iron Man and Thor were assigned\nto Avengers along with Bucky Barnes as Captain America\nwhile Steve Rogers headed the Secret Avengers. Iron Man was slightly troubled\nthat he may not be able to take orders from Steve, but Steve told him that\nMaria Hill would oversee the Avengers.</p><p>On the day the Avengers formed they were attacked by Kang\nwho thrashed Avengers Tower\nand stated that the time stream was out of flux due to the actions of their\nchildren. Although, the Avengers were reluctant to believe him and dismissed it as a trap, they decided to confirm just in case. Iron Man along with the help of Marvel Boy were\nable to build a time-traveling device and the Avengers split into two groups:\none that traveled into the future to investigate and another that stayed behind to handle troubles in their current time.</p><p>Iron Man traveled to the future and met his future version\nas well as Maestro who was an older Hulk. They worked together to figure out a\nway to fix the time stream. Tony was surprised at how much his older version\nwas fascinated with time travel and that frankly he didn\u2019t share the same hobby. Realizing\nthe only way to fix the time stream was for Kang to defeat Ultron, Iron Man\nwent to Ultron who was powered with the Destroyer armor and reasoned with him\nto surrender. After Ultron realized the severity of the issue, and that his\nreign was not worth leaving the time stream out of order where Kang would continue\nto challenge him endlessly losing, he decided not to fight back and lost the battle.\nThis fixed the time stream.</p><p>The Avengers\u2019 next dire mission put them up against the Hood\nwho had escaped from jail and attained the knowledge of the Infinity Gems. The\nHood began collecting the gems and with two gems he easily defeated the Red\nHulk. The Red Hulk, then went to the Avengers and asked for help. Upon hearing\nthe nature of the crisis, Iron Man ran out half way into the Avengers meeting\nand contacted the members of the Illuminati, who were each responsible for the\nsafeguarding of one of the gems, himself included.</p><p>The group met and decided that the best course of action was to\nmake sure that each of their gems was secure and that they will need their immense\ngifted powers in their confrontation with the Hood. As soon as they were about\nto leave and head to their duties, the Avengers arrived at their doorstep\nhaving tailed Iron Man and demanded answers to what they knew.</p><p>The Illuminati realized they had no choice but to come out\nclean. Steve Rogers realized that this sort of scheme to secretly keep an\nimmense source of power to be of Iron Man machination. He blamed Iron Man for\nthis entire turn of events and threatened Tony that if he couldn\u2019t do anything\nabout their current situation he would be kicked out of the Avengers.</p><p>While the Avengers and the Illuminati were having this\nconfrontation, the Hood was at work gathering more Infinity Gems and thus attaining more\npower. When Iron Man was returning to the location where he had secured the\nReality Gem, (the Avengers still tailing him and thus slowing down the process\nto remove the protocols he\u2019d set up to guard the gem) they found the Hood who\nwas just grabbing the gem. He easily defeated all of the Avengers and went to\nincrease his collection.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1624848\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64034/1624848-avnv4012_cov.jpg\" title=\"Avengers #12\"><img id=\"1624848\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64034/1624848-avnv4012_cov_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers #12\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers #12</div></div></div></div><p>While the Avengers were down, Dr. Strange used the powers of\nhis Infinity Gem and transformed himself into Thanos and tried to buy some time\nfor the Avengers. Iron Man, along with the help of Thor, Namor and the Red Hulk\nwere able to use the power of the Infinity Gems they had left and were able to\ndefeat the Hood. Iron Man used his gem and told all the gems to no longer\nexist. However, this was really not the case, and the Illuminati met secretly once\nmore but inducted Steve Rogers amongst them making him in charge of safeguarding one\nof the gems.</p><p>On the day Tony was to public display his car, he was\nattacked by H.A.M.M.E.R. and Detroit Steel. He found out that the drones were controlled\nby a cell phone application and with the help of his team was able to shut them\nall down. Tony was then able to focus on battling Detroit Steel who was trying to make\nhis own publicity stunt by defeating Iron Man which would prove that the U.S.\nGovernment would be getting a better deal from H.A.M.M.E.R. than they ever did from Stark\n(as Stark had rejected to make anything for them) However, the battle proved\nfruitless for Detroit Steel and Iron Man was able to save the day. However,\nthis was only a minor setback to H.A.M.M.E.R. who were able to form a partnership\nwith both Ezekiel and the Mandarin for preparation towards their next\nconfrontation.</p><p>Having saved the day for now and his new company starting to shape\nup, he went to a local Alcoholics Anonymous meeting at the behest of Pepper to\ninspire confidence to those suffering from the condition. Things seemed to be\ngoing well for Tony but <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Doctor Octopus</a> challenged him telling him that he had a\nbomb that would detonate most of the city if he didn\u2019t comply to his request.</p><p>When Iron Man went to the location he met Doctor Octopus and\nrecalled their early years as classmates. He challenged Iron Man to either remedy his current health condition or publicly admit defeat that he was unable to\nsolve such a case. Tony stated that Octavius' past actions were catching up with him and\nthat he needed to see a doctor which he wasn\u2019t.</p><p>Meanwhile, Stark Resilient was also attacked by <a href=\"/electro/29-3228/\">Electro</a> and <a href=\"/sandman/29-3544/\">Sandman</a>, who were sent by Doctor Octopus. However, Pepper proved to be quite a match for them and they ended up having\nto retreat. At the base, Doctor Octopus told Tony to beg him, which he\nhumiliatingly complied with realizing that lives were at stake for the mere\npleasure of the mad man. Doctor Octopus recorded the scene and let Tony go and\nstated that he had been outsmarted and that there really wasn\u2019t a bomb to\ndiffuse.</p><p>Tony flew back to his office to see if everyone was alright.\nUpon the positive turn of events, Tony and Pepper decided to enjoy themselves and were staring into the sunset when they\nwitnessed something fast falling from the sky. Upon hearing that there were\nmultiple such occurrences of such an event around the world, Tony went to Paris\nto investigate where one of the hammers had fallen and told Pepper to hire <a href=\"/bethany-cabe/29-33030/\">Bethany Cabe</a> who dismissed the idea stating the Tony just wanted another\nredhead in his office. Tony told her that it was because she was resourceful and\ncapable woman.</p><p>When Iron Man arrived in Paris,\nhe witnessed the horrors of a ghost town. Everyone in the city had been turned\ninto solid rock and Stark scanned to see if there were any survivors. Iron Man\nsoon confronted the Grey Gargoyle who had been favored by the Serpent as worthy\nof being a hammer wielder. He fought back but his efforts proved futile. During\nthe battle, Tony crashed into lots of sculptures, and vomited in his suit. He\ndecided to retreat and call for assistance but on his way back he learned of\nBucky death and was one of the few people looking over his dead body. When Thor\nand Steve arrived, they decided upon a course of plan and Tony sacrificed his\ndignity by drinking once more to gain an audience with <a href=\"/odin/29-3507/\">Odin</a>. Odin accepted this sacrifice, and granted him an audience. During this audience, Tony suggested that he make weapons to counter the Serpent and his Worthy, which could then be blessed by Odin. Odin agreed with Tony's suggestion, and then sent him to work with some dwarves on forging the weapons.</p><p>Whilst working on the weapons, Tony is attacked by a golem sent by some smoke elves, and would have been killed if it weren't for the dwarves saving him. He then finds out that in order to have his armour blessed, he will have to leap into a vat of molten metal with it on, as he can't remove it. He does so, and survives the ordeal. Prior to going to the final battle with the Serpent, the smoke elves whom set the golem on Tony are caught, and the dwarves whom Tony has been working with urge him to kill them. However, Tony realises that if he were to kill the smoke elves, then in a tiny way, the Serpent would be winning the point of his war, and so Tony refuses to kill them. He then joins the rest of the Avengers in the battle against the Serpent, and they succeed in defeating the Serpent and his Worthy, although at the cost of Thor. In the aftermath of the battle, Odin restores Paris from the destroyed state Tony had found it in.</p><p>Just because the war is over, however, it doesn't mean that things are calm. Tony's drinking was leaked to the public, and Tony's old enemy Mandarin conspired to utterly destroy Tony once and for all, working alongside Ezekiel Stane and the Hammers. With the knowledge of Tony's drinking becoming public, the Mandarin arranges matters to make it look as though Tony is still drinking, and therefore not fit to be using the Iron Man armour. Along with Zeke Stane, they also upgrade many of Tony's old enemies, whilst planting bombs within them in order to ensure their loyalty.</p><p>In order to further Mandarin's plans, Tony's old enemies start committing various acts of terrorism. During one of these, in which Iron Man and War Machine team up, Rhodey seems to be killed, although unknown to the public his death was merely faked. Giving in to a subpoena asking for his biometric information, Tony is fitted with a device allowing the US Government to retract his armour any time that they feel he isn't fit to be using the armour. With the Hammers behind this, it essentially means that they can control him at all times. Eventually, Tony gives in to them, and relinquishes his suit and expels it from his body in order to escape from under the control of the Hammers. Unbeknownst to them, however, Tony has recently created another suit of armour, which he has given to Rhodey to become the new Iron Man, giving him time to think a way out of Mandarin's plan.</p><h3>Avengers vs. X-Men</h3><p>Iron Man, with <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>, the <a href=\"/noh-varr/29-11565/\">Protector</a> and <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> save a crashing plane from destroying the city after <a href=\"/nova/29-2105/\">Nova</a> crash lands on Earth. Tony and <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> advise the President that the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a> is heading back towards Earth as they head to <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Utopia</a> to take <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope</a>. After <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> strikes the first blow at Cap, Iron Man and several other Avenger teams descend from the Helicarrier and attack the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>. Tony stops <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> from using her telepathy by using nanites before she turns to diamond and punches him in the stomach. <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> arrives but is unable to take control of Tony's suit as it is made of carbon nano-fiber tubing. However, Erik does drop a tower of Utopia on top of Iron Man. Tony comes through the rubble and fires 2 million high grade neodymium magnets to stop Magneto but he overpowers them. Iron Man resorts to using his satellites to drain the magnetic power from Jupiter to charge a unibeam and fires on Erik. Magneto still does not go down and destroys the satellites, using them to create his own suit of armor and resorts to a punch out with Iron Man. Tony winds up knocking out Magneto soon after.</p><p>After the battle at Utopia, Iron Man argues with Captain America about the methods he's using to pursue Hope. Tony remains at <a href=\"/avengers-tower/34-40830/\">Avengers Tower</a>, working on a way to stop the Phoenix Force. He discovers that the Phoenix Force was created in the microseconds between cosmic death and rebirth after the Big Bang. He continues working on a \"Phoenix Killer\" but has to crack universal expansion in order to do so. Iron Man joins Cap and the Avengers on the Blue Side of the Moon when they discover that Hope was there. They arrive same time as the X-Men but the fighting stops when Thor crashed onto the Moon from space and the Phoenix Force arrives.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><h3>Characteristics</h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'1\" (6'6\" in armor)</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 225 lbs (previously without armor) (250 lbs with armor)</li><li><b>Eyes Color:</b> Blue</li><li><b>Hair Color:</b> Black</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> Publicly Known</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Long Island, New York</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> USA</li><li><b>Education:</b> PhDs in Physics and Electrical Engineering</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer, CEO of Star Resilient, founder of the Maria Stark Foundation, former director of S.H.I.E.L.D.,CEO of Stark Industries, Stark International, Stark Enterprises, Stark Solutions, and Circuits Maximus, US Secretary of Defence, Computer technician, inventor</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> Howard Anthony Walter Stark (father, deceased), Maria Collins Carbonell Stark (mother, deceased), Morgan Stark (cousin), Edward Stark (uncle, deceased), Isaac Stark Sr., Isaac Stark Jr. (ancestors, deceased)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2042536\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/49163/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super.jpg\" title=\"Armored Avenger\"><img id=\"2042536\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/49163/2042536-1173189_51_iron_man__legacy_1_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Armored Avenger\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Armored Avenger</div></div></div></div><p>Tony Stark's intellect allows him to constantly upgrade his armor designs. Stark recently had to inject himself with the Extremis techno-organic virus to save his life. The effects are that now the inner layers of the Iron Man suit can be stored in the hollows of his bones, and he can control the suit with his mind through direct brain impulses. He can also remotely connect to just about any communication device, including satellites and computers, across the world. Stark can even regenerate organs due to the enhancement. Extremis also allows Stark to interface with his armor in a faster and more efficient manner as well, thus dramatically increasing his response time. Without his armor Tony Stark is considered to be above peak human and has displayed superhuman capabilities such as super human reflexes, His speed, strength and agility without his armor is now considered to be at peak human levels.</p><p>Iron Man's abilities are constantly changing because of his constant technological upgrades on the armors. In general terms, he has super strength due to the build of his armor. The exact amount of strength is unknown, but it seems that he can lift and press over 100 tons.</p><p>The armor is very durable, capable of withstanding tremendous amounts of punishment. Tony Stark's armor has a muscularly aligned matrix of crystallized iron enhanced by magnetic fields over layers of other metals like titanium, which grants him endurance capable of withstanding high caliber bullets with ease. He can withstand rockets, torpedoes and such, although he does take damage. The armor also enables Iron Man to fly at high speeds, exceeding the speed of a jet airplane, due to the rocket propelled boots that are placed on the bottom of the armor's boots.</p><p>Iron Man's suit has many power sources, such as solar converters, electrical batteries and an on-board generator that uses beta particle absorption as a fuel source. The suit is also able to convert nearby energy sources, such as heat or kinetic energy into electricity, or even drain electrical energy directly into the batteries for recharge. Although the suit has some open holes to allow the wearer to breathe normal air, it can be sealed off, allowing the pilot of the suit to go underwater or into space by granting its own life support and limited air supply systems.</p><p>As mentioned, Tony Stark controls the suit mostly by movement as if the armor is his skin and through the Extremis upgrade(before it started to fail), essentially making the suit an extension of his own body. In addition to this however is an internal artificial intelligence operating system that provides strategies, background information on opponents, and on surroundings and the current status of the suit.</p><p>The Extremis upgrade gave him a healing factor and enhanced abilities and could expel the inner-most armor layer in his body then \"will\" the rest of the Extremis armor to attach to him</p><p>Stark also has equipped the suit with numerous weapons over the years, making the suit more powerful each time. The most often used weapons are the repulsor rays (magnetically channeled beams of super-heated plasma) that are fired from Iron Man's palms or gauntlets. Other weapons that are built into the armor include the uni-beam projector in its chest (controlling the full range of the electromagnetic spectrum from blinding searchlights to cutting lasers), pulse bolts that pick up kinetic energy along the way, so that they hit harder the further they have to travel, an electromagnetic pulse generator and energy shield, the generation of ultra-freons, the creating and manipulating of magnetic fields, sonic blasts, and a holographic generator to create decoys.</p><p>Tony Stark has also created many specialized models of the armor. Other models that are in his possession include a model for deep-sea diving, for stealth, space travel, etc. He has also enhanced the armor on a few occasions for unique circumstances. For example, Tony Stark has modified suits like the \"Hulkbuster\" heavy armor, composed of add-ons to his so-called modular armor, designed to enhance its strength and durability to allow it to take on the Incredible Hulk in combat. One time, when Stark had to face Thor, he made an armor modeled on the <a href=\"../../destroyer/29-7940/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Destroyer</a> and used a mystical power source.</p><p>While the Iron Man suit is very durable, high amounts of lighting or electricity can make the suit overload, as well as magnets, as this would happen to a regular machine.</p><p>Tony stark is effectively a genius, able to constantly create new and improved technologies and make upgrade after upgrade to his suit of cybernetic armor. Iron Man is able to harness his intelligence and ingenuity in order to allow him to defeat more powerful foes and escape their dangerous traps and machinations. Stark is also a powerful leader, able to command the loyalty and respect of others. Stark has been expertly trained by Captain America in hand-to-hand combat, making him a formidable opponent even without the power suit.</p><p>For more information on Iron Man's various armors see: <a href=\"../../iron-man-armor/18-50749/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man Armor.</a></p><h2>Iron Man/War Machine</h2><p>One of the most requested and sought after battles in the Marvel Universe has always been War Machine vs Iron man.

Like the original Marvel Universe Tony, he has a dependency on alcohol and a life-threatening affliction. In this case however, his condition is an inoperable brain tumor which could kill him at anytime. For that reason he decides to use his remaining time to the best of his ability, becoming a philanthropist and superhero using the armor he creates.</p><p>In the Ultimate Iron Man limited series, it's revealed that the reason for Tony's unprecedented brilliance is that his body contains a regenerative virus which caused him to grow extra neural tissue throughout his body, effectively expanding his brain. However, a side-effect causes him constant pain, which is mitigated by alcohol one reason why he drinks so heavily. On the upside, the virus also lets him regrow lost limbs and organs with incredible speed, as long as he has enough protein available. His skin is also impregnated with a \"bacterial armor\" that makes him resistant to impact, though it apparently isn't fireproof. The bacteria would eat the skin of anyone who can't regenerate in minutes, which is why he hasn't mass-produced the design.</p><p><b><a href=\"../../the-ultimates/49-18327/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Human</a></b></p><p>While forming the original <a href=\"../../ultimates/65-40504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimates</a>, Tony Stark along with <a href=\"../../nick-fury/29-3202/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nick Fury</a> are present for the thawing out of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>.

Iron Man is one of the main characters of the <a href=\"../../marvel-zombies/39-40611/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Zombies</a> storyline. Iron Man appears to be one of the uninfected heroes in the S.H.I.E.L.D Helicarrier where the uninfected had met to hear Nick Fury's plan to save Earth from the virus. Iron Man is infected with the virus and he joins the infected zombies on the rampage to find food and consume it. He appears to be one of the zombies left in the Earth after everything was consumed and is one of the zombies to see <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Surfer</a> come to Earth to tell them that <a href=\"../../galactus/29-2149/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Galactus</a> was coming to eat the planet. The zombies attack him and Iron Man loses his bottom half of his body during the fight but is thrown into the fray by <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>. After Silver Surer is subdued, Iron Man becomes one of the few to feast on the Silver Surfer and soon is able to fly again since he had gained a portion of the Surfer's powers. He is one of the zombies seen fighting Galactus, and he retreats to think of a plan to defeat Galactus. He thinks of making a machine where it combines all the zombies new Silver Surfer powers and unleash against Galactus. Iron Man, along with Hulk and Giant Man, build the machine while Galactus is fighting the others. They complete it and the zombies that had gained the Surfer's powers combine their powers into the machine and shoot a beam of the energy at Galactus. Galactus staggers a bit and they shoot a couple more until Galactus falls. Iron Man is one of the zombies that fight the villain zombies to see who would eat Galactus. The heroes easily win and they feed on Galactus, who was becoming conscious and Iron Man becomes one of the few who had gained Galactus's powers. He is seen appearing in an alien world flying with the zombies that had gained Galactus's powers. Later, Iron Man and the zombies are returning to Earth after forty years of consuming the universe. They return to Earth to see that there are still survivors and they attack the remaining survivors. They face opposition from Spider-Man and <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a> along with the survivors.

The zombies swarm in after the breach has occurred. Giant Man realizes his hunger had disappeared and and tells all the zombies that their hunger is gone. The zombies realize it too and they agree that they stop attacking and spare the survivors. However, an enraged Hulk appears and is hungry for food. Hulk assaults the survivors, but the zombie heroes intervene to save the survivors.

He eventually turned his power over to a young Victor Von Doom who used the power of the cosmic cube to enslave and keep any resistance under control in the world. In this world, Tony Stark's father, Howard worked along side the Red Skull until he stepped down from power. Tony used his advanced technology to serve his world's Dr. Doom and eventually created an armor and became known as the \"Iron Nazi\". With his armor he was able to match any hero who opposed him or Doom's power. He was eventually defeated by Mainframe who used his superior technology to over power his armor and shut him down.

He also appears in the current story arc in the <a href=\"/incredible-hulks/49-35303/\">Incredible Hulks</a>, and is leading a new incarnation of the <a href=\"/defenders/65-26333/\">Defenders</a>. As well as this he is attempting to stop Hell spreading any further from Las Vegas in the Venom story arc Circle Of Four.</p><h2>Origin</h2><p>At a young age, Stephen Strange had dreams of becoming a doctor. The eldest child of three, Strange was born in 1930 while his parents Eugene and Beverly Strange were on vacation in Philadelphia. At the age of eleven he aided his younger sister Donna when she was injured, which proved to be a formative experience for him, and he was inspired to attend med school after high school. Ironically, it was his inability to later save her from drowning when he was nineteen and on leave from college that undermined his belief in life\u2019s meaning and the value of idealism. Nevertheless, he rapidly finished med school at a young age and became a successful neurosurgeon.</p><p>Strange displayed phenomenal talent in his chosen field, and quickly attained wealth and notoriety. The more successful he became, the more arrogant he grew. Eventually this led to estrangement from his family and the undoing of his relationship with a United Nations translator named Madeline Revell to whom he had proposed marriage. So distant and self-absorbed did he become that he refused to visit his father on his deathbed. His enraged younger brother <a href=\"/victor-strange/29-21556/\">Victor</a> Strange berated him for this, and then was killed as he ran into traffic. Stephen then placed the body of his brother into cryogenic storage. At a much later stage Stephen attempted to restore his brother through magical means, but instead imbued him with the curse of vampirism.</p><p>A car accident that damaged the nerves in his hands changed everything for Stephen Strange. He was no longer able to be a surgeon, yet he refused to become an assistant or consultant, instead squandering his money travelling the world and searching for a cure. One day he heard a rumor of a mystical personage known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ancient-one/29-2212/\">Ancient One</a> in Tibet. Marshaling the last of his inner and outer resources, Strange diligently searched until the fortress of the Ancient One was revealed to him. Though initially outraged that the aged mystic refused to cure his hands, Strange\u2019s anger was quickly replaced by amazement when the reality of magical forces was demonstrated before his eyes as he witnessed an attack on the Ancient One.</p><p>Circumstances revealed to Strange that it was none other than <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baron-mordo/29-2213/\">Baron Mordo</a>, the Ancient One\u2019s chief disciple, who was the perpetrator of the attack, and who continued to plot the destruction of the antediluvian mystic in an attempt to gain power. To his horror, Strange learned he was unable to reveal this after Mordo easily ensorcelled him. Realizing the Ancient One was a force for good; Stephen selflessly abandoned his quest to restore his hands and committed himself to magical tutelage with the intention of foiling Mordo\u2019s insidious scheme. By this act Strange proved himself to the Ancient One, to whom the entire melodrama had been transparent. Thus Doctor Strange put himself on the path to become the new Sorcerer Supreme of the Earth dimension, yet gained a deadly enemy in Baron Mordo.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Doctor Strange was created by the writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steve-ditko/26-4026/\">Steve Ditko</a> and made his first ever appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/strange-tales-the-human-torch-vs-the-wizard-and-paste-pot-pete/37-110835/\">Strange Tales #110</a> in 1963.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>After many years of training, Strange returned to New York. He became a mystical consultant and started having interactions with the superhero community. After the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> formed and many superheroes began to surface, Doctor Strange found a friend in <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>. Spider-Man helped him rescue a group of people from another dimension and suggested that Strange remove from their memory this traumatic experience, though this meant that they would forget his own heroism. Initially tricked into conflict with each other by <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a>, <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> and Doctor Strange also formed an early alliance to combat the god of mischief.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"111025\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1867/111025-57299-clea_super.jpg\" title=\"Strange and Clea\"><img id=\"111025\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1867/111025-57299-clea_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Strange and Clea\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Strange and Clea</div></div></div></div><p>Noteworthy among the good Doctor\u2019s numerous foes over the years as Earth\u2019s magical guardian were the Dread <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a>, <a href=\"/shuma-gorath/29-14000/\">Shuma-Gorath</a>, <a href=\"/undying-ones/29-27708/\">the Undying Ones</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightmare/29-2646/\">Nightmare</a>. Strange\u2019s first battle with Dormammu ensued when the powerful demigod of the Dark Dimension attempted to invade earth\u2019s plane as he perceived the wane of the Ancient One\u2019s might. Strange was forced to duel Dormammu in the Dark Dimension, and though vastly out-powered by the god-like entity, Strange was able to tax Dormammu to the extent that the barrier separating beings know as the Mindless Ones from the rest of the Dark Dimension became compromised. A force of pure destruction, the Mindless Ones would have meant annihilation to the other denizens of Dormmamu\u2019s realm, and Strange nobly contributed his power to his enemy to prevent their being unleashed.</p><p>Bound by whatever strange honor as applies to his daemonic ilk, Dormammu then called off his invasion and released Strange. They were to clash many times subsequently, however, and Dormammu has been one of Strange\u2019s most implacable and powerful foes. It was during this adventure that Doctor Strange also met Clea, a beautiful but inexperienced mystic (the daughter of Umar, Dormmamu\u2019s sister), who became Strange\u2019s first apprentice, as well as his lover.</p><p>In one of his more bizarre adventures, Strange fought the demonic forces of Shuma-Gorath, an ancient Lovecraftian entity that coveted earth\u2019s domination from the world\u2019s distant past and this time threatened our reality using the very mind of Doctor Strange\u2019s beloved mentor, the Ancient One. Though it agonized him, Strange was left with no choice but to obey his teacher and slay him to prevent the holocaust Shuma-Gorath would have unleashed upon the world. The Ancient One then ascended to become one with the being known as Eternity, while Strange inherited the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Sorcerer Supreme</h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/defenders/65-26333/\">Defenders</a> were born when Doctor Strange formed a bizarre team-up with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, Namor, and later the Silver Surfer. These four strong personalities somehow managed to work together and started the unlikely super-team known as the Defenders to combat yet another world-conquering demonic threat, this time in the form of beings called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/undying-ones/29-27708/\">Undying Ones</a> who were led by the evil and ancient <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-nameless-one/29-30341/\">Nameless One</a>. The Defenders went on to battle numerous threats both supernatural and mundane (so to speak), and were joined in an oft-changing roster that included such unlikely characters as the Silver Surfer, <a>Hellstorm</a>, the <a>Overmind</a>, <a>Valkyrie</a>, <a>Nighthawk</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellcat/49-6778/\">Hellcat</a>.</p><p>In yet another impressive display of the capabilities of a Sorcerer Supreme, Strange opposed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dracula/29-7206/\">Dracula</a> himself to rid the world, at least for a time, of the plague of vampirism. Assisted by a dedicated band of vampire hunters (Hannibal King, Blade, and Frank Drake) and Wong. Doctor Strange kept Dracula busy, while the others recited the Montessi Formula from <a>The</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-darkhold/18-45058/\">Darkhold</a> and destroyed virtually all the world\u2019s vampires, including Dracula. Yet this very undoing for most of the world\u2019s vampires interacted with the previous spells Stephen Strange had attempted in his resurrection of his brother Victor, causing Victor to rise from the grave as the undead. Later developments also allowed the resurrection of many of the destroyed Nosferatu, though Strange banished the Vampire Verses to another plane of existence</p><h3>Infinity Gauntlet</h3><p>Strange went on to battle a host of threats to the Earth dimension, at times battling cosmic entities such as the <a>In-Betweener</a>; participating in the power struggles over the dominion of the Dark Dimension between Clea, Umar, and Dormammu; and joining other heroes to oppose <a>Thanos</a> in his attempt to gain the <a>Infinity Gauntlet</a>; to name but a few. He has triumphed over others bearing the title Sorcerer Supreme, such as <a>Salome</a>, the first Sorcerer Supreme of Earth, and <a>Shanzar</a>, the Sorcerer Supreme of another dimension. Though he at first resisted such calls because of his duties as Earth\u2019s mystical protector, Strange was eventually drawn into a 5,000 year battle against the Trinity of Ashes on the side of the <a>Vishanti</a>. Because of the magical nature of the realm in which he fought, or because of his innate power, Strange was absent from his home dimension for this conflict for only a few months in everyone else\u2019s perceptions and appeared to age but little.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79317\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/376/79317-97822-illuminati_super.jpg\" title=\"The Illuminati\"><img id=\"79317\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/376/79317-97822-illuminati_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Illuminati\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Illuminati</div></div></div></div><p>Doctor Strange does continue to show a certain predilection for arrogance, as evidenced by his susceptibility to Yandroth\u2019s manipulation when Namor, the Hulk, the Silver Surfer and himself banded together to essentially take over the world. <a>Yandroth</a> had banded the four together by an apparently unbreakable curse (because it was the will of <a>Gaea</a>) that forced them to be teleported to the scene whenever a threat to the Earth manifested. The curse also heightened their natural egotism and irritability, which for these four was considerable. Unwilling to be snatched away from their other responsibilities any time the curse decreed there was a threat, the four decided instead to form the Order, which would keep the world safe by taking control and preventing threats from arising. Opposed by the other heroes of earth, the four appeared to have the power to triumph, but they realized in time that Yandroth was mystically siphoning the power generated by their violence to resurrect himself with the power of a god.</p><p>While they called off their plans and dispersed, they would not surrender themselves to mortal authorities for judgment. Doctor Strange was able to convince Gaea to let the four serve her willingly, and the curse was broken. Though unquestionably a mighty force for good that has saved the Earth and even the universe from destruction multiple times, this saga, along with such examples as his manipulations during the formation of the Defenders and the <a>Midnight Sons</a>; as well as his participation with the actions of the <a>Illuminati</a>, demonstrate signs of the old hubris that dominated his character when he was still a neurosurgeon.</p><h3>Civil War and World War Hulk</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"757614\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1_super.jpg\" title=\"STRANGE SMASH!\"><img id=\"757614\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/757614-strangethreatenshulk1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"STRANGE SMASH!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">STRANGE SMASH!</div></div></div></div><p>Dr. Strange became a member of the New Avengers after the end of the Civil War which he did not become involved in. He assisted the team on their first mission to Japan, and was severely wounded. During their second mission, to defeat <a>The Hood's Gang</a>, Dr. Strange had to use extreme magic to take them all down. Prior to the event of <a>World War Hulk</a>, Strange was one of the Illuminati who voted to exile the Hulk because of his destructive tendencies. When the Hulk came back and demanded the presence of the those who exiled him, Strange infiltrated his mind as a way to calm him down, but Hulk knew this move all along and gave him the opportunity to break Strange's hands, so that he could not use his magic. Strange became desperate and drank a vial containing the essence of <a>Zom</a>, a powerful demon that he had once faced. When Strange and Hulk fought, Strange was winning but not before realizing that Zom is slowly influencing his actions. With this realization, he was defeated by Hulk and held captive in his make-shift gladiator arena of Madison Square Garden.</p><h3>Strange No More</h3><p>Strange later left the New Avengers feeling that he'd used to much dark magic, and must train in the use of light magic again. In the end, he failed in his duties as Sorcerer Supreme, thus his title is removed from him. In light of this he no longer wore his cloak of levitation nor the eye of Agamotto. Instead he went out to search for the new Sorcerer Supreme, hoping it was someone who had good intents instead of evil. The first person he visited was <a>Wiccan</a>, but there he was attacked by The <a>Hood</a> who was taken over by his demonic cape. With the help of Wiccan he managed to escape and went to the <a>New Avengers</a> for help. Together they went to <a>Hellstorm</a> During the ride there, the eye of Agamotto glowed brightly and disapeared, according to Dr. Strange to the new Sorcerer Supreme. In the meantime the Hood was fighting Hellstorm but the fight was interrupted when a new player came in, <a>Brother Voodoo</a>, wearing the Cloak of Levitation and the Eye of Agamotto. The New Sorcerer Supreme!</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>After fighting off Hood and Dormmamu along side his allies Strange offers to train Voodoo in his new title which he accepts. Later during the Dark Reign Iron Man attempts to hide the information of the super heroes from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> and wipes his mind clean which causes him to loose his intellect and after a beating by Osborn himself falls into a coma. Several attempts are made to revive him and soon Strange is called in to help. After traveling into Stark's mind he is able to bring him out of his dream and accept that he is Iron Man. While vulnerable Ghost arrives hoping to kill Stark but Strange comes out of his spell first and fights Ghost, but is wounded in battle. Iron Man awakens next and transports Ghost away with his own technology.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1343138\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1343138-77_new_avengers_6_super.jpg\" title=\"An Avenger Again\"><img id=\"1343138\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1343138-77_new_avengers_6_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"An Avenger Again\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">An Avenger Again</div></div></div></div><p>After Osborn finally snapped and attacked Asgard Steve Rogers was given Osborn's old position and invited Strange to once again join the Avengers and he accepts. Soon after joining a demonic force possessing Strange and Damian Hellstorm attacks Doctor Voodoo trying to take the Eye of Agamotto by force. The mystical item teleports itself to the Mansion but is chased by the same force going from Luke Cage to eventually Iron Fist. After releasing a demonic army and kidnapping Iron Fist the source of the assault takes on the form of The Ancient One but after realizing his actions are uncharacteristic it is revealed to be Agamotto himself. He claims the Vishanti are dead and he want's his eye back. The Avengers accept a challenge from him and imbue Wolverine with all their combined powers to fight against Agamotto. In end Voodoo uses the power of the eye to apparently kill both Agamotto and himself. Whether this means Strange is once again Sorcerer Supreme or if that title even mean anything anymore is unknown.</p><h3>Circle of Four</h3><p>When Blackheart tried to use a Hell\ncreated Centrifuge to plunge Earth into Hell, Strange and Daimon\nHellstorm were present to try and prevent this. However, Johnny Blaze\nhad already placed an amulet, given to Hawkeye by Strange, on the\nborder of Las Vegas, preventing Hell from stretching any further.</p><p>However, while <a href=\"/flash-thompson/29-1489/\">Venom</a>, <a href=\"/thaddeus-ross/29-3457/\">Red Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/x-23/29-3560/\">X-23</a>\nand the new <a href=\"/ghost-rider/29-4268/\">Ghost Rider</a> fight within the barrier to prevent Hell and\nBlackheart from succeeding, Strange and Daimon work from the outside\nto prevent Hell spreading further, when the amulet shatters. They\nbattle fiercely until Daimon gives in, under the persuasion of\nBlackheart. Fortunately, the four heroes within find a way to reverse\nthe march of Hell and to defeat Blackheart, freeing Strange and\nDaimon, who notices that the four heroes have been marked with pentagrams similar to his own.</p><h2>Personal Information</h2><h3><b>Physical Attributes</b></h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'2 1/2\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 180 lbs.</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Gray</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Black, white at temples</li></ul><h3>Status</h3><ul><li><b>Identity:</b> The general public regards Strange as an ordinary occult scholar, if not a charlatan</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Sorcerer, adventurer, occult consultant; former <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sorcerer-supreme/12-55956/\">Sorcerer Supreme</a> of Earth dimension, physician, neurosurgeon</li><li><b>Citizenship:</b> U.S.A.</li><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</li><li><b>Education:</b> Medical doctorate, extensive sorcery training through a mixture of self-education and vast arcane lore</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Estranged</li><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eugene-strange/29-25259/\">Eugene</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beverly-strange/29-25260/\">Beverly Strange</a> (parents, deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/victor-strange/29-21556/\">Victor Strange</a> (Khiron, brother, presumed deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donna-strange/29-21562/\">Donna Strange</a> (sister, deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/clea/29-2216/\">Clea</a> (wife, estranged), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/umar/29-2637/\">Umar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/orini/29-28659/\">Orini</a> (parents-in-law), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a> (uncle-in-law)</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Master of Sorcery</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1068758\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1068758-113_the_mystic_hands_of_dr__strange_02.jpg\" title=\"Master of the Mystic Arts\"><img id=\"1068758\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1068758-113_the_mystic_hands_of_dr__strange_02_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Master of the Mystic Arts\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Master of the Mystic Arts</div></div></div></div><p>Master of the Mystic Arts, Doctor Strange is one of the most powerful sorcerers in the world. Dr. Strange uses mystical energy invoked upon by spells/incantations or by the power of divine beings to manipulate forces of the universe including projection of mystic energy as bolts, slashes, binds, shields, or a scattered array of energy appearing like electricity, manipulating matter and various energies (physical or spiritual) even transmutation of matter, controlling the elements, opening or sealing mystical portals to other realms, teleportation or dimensional travel, reality warping and control over dimension, seeing through or casting illusions, invisibility and intangibility through astral projection, vast mental powers such as telepathy and telekinesis, communication with the dead and spiritual entities, seeing the future or past, manipulating dreams, removing spirits or placing them back into bodies, summoning supernatural beings, or using the powers of supernatural items.</p><p>Many of Doctor Strange\u2019s powers are a function of his ability to manipulate the ambient mystical energy of the Marvel Universe. With this ability Dr. Strange can perform many functions. Commonly this is seen as energy attacks that range from low power to planet destroying, transmutation, telekinesis, teleportation, protective shields, etc. He uses this mystical energy to cast spells of a near infinite variety. Dr. Strange can also channel the virtually unlimited energy of nigh-omnipotent mystical and non-mystical beings--known as Principalities--to empower his spells. This can take the form of stating what he wants to occur. This ability to be a conduit to multi-versal power sources has given rise to the phrase \"Dr. Strange is as powerful as the god he invokes\". He is quite capable of utilizing power that is considered \"black magic\", though he tends to do so only under extreme exigency. Though he rarely has, he can absorb the power of even a cosmic or semi-deity entity. Doctor Strange has a pact with Eternity possibly allowing him to live as long as the Ancient One and others before him have.</p><p>Doctor Strange has been noted calling upon many sorcerous phrases invoking certain entities, usually the above-mentioned Principalities. One example:</p><p><i>\u201cSeven rings hath Raggador, from indigo to deepest black, Yet Oshtur grant me something more: The Crimson Bands of Cyttorak!\u201d</i></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"176330\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange_super.jpg\" title=\"Eye of Agamotto\"><img id=\"176330\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1714/176330-67644-doctor-strange_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Eye of Agamotto\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Eye of Agamotto</div></div></div></div><p>This phrase for instance, would cause unbreakable magical bonds to appear, capable of constraining even the Hulk. In addition to <a>Cyttorak</a> and <a>Oshtur</a>, among the beings of power called upon by Strange are all-seeing <a>Agamotto</a> and hoary <a>Hoggoth</a>, who along with Oshtur form the triad known as the eternal Vishanti; the Seraphim; Cthon (who created the Darkhold tome); Gaia; <a>Ikonn</a>; Dormammu (rarely) and the hell-lord <a>Satannish</a>. Sometimes it appears the substance of mystical realms is invoked rather than the beings who rule over them, as when Strange summons the Flames of the Faltine (the birthplace dimension of Dormammu, but also particular energy beings who rule there). This may explain why Strange is able to call upon such evil entities as Cthon and Satannish to power certain spells, yet not be in their service.</p><p>Certain beings are typically invoked for particular effects, such as Ikonn for illusions, the Seraphim for protective effects like shields and the like, Cyttorak for bindings, Agamotto for dispelling negativity and revealing the truth, etc. Other magical constructs commonly employed through such agencies are the Vapors of Valtoor, the Chains of Krakkan, and the Seven Suns of Cinnibus. Doctor Strange seems to be more so than anyone else under the favored patronage of the powerful Vishanti.</p><h3>Magical Artifacts</h3><p>The Sorcerer Supreme possesses a formidable arsenal of magical artifacts, two of which are particularly recognizable-- the Eye of Agamotto and the Cloak of Levitation. The Eye of Agamotto is an artifact with many uses, such as vastly extending Dr. Strange's psychic abilities, inter dimensional travel, emitting a light that pierces all deception and is anathema to evil beings, serving as a protective talisman, and other feats. It can be used as an almost irresistible offensive weapon, though Strange rarely does so. Similar to <a>Mjolnir</a>, the Eye can only be used by those it deems as morally worthy. The Cloak of Levitation has been a third set of hands for Dr. Strange, responding to his thoughts to entangle opponents, and allowing him to fly and levitate. It is virtually indestructible and has shielded him from attacks as well.</p><p>Strange also possesses the Orb of Agamotto, a sort of hyper-powerful crystal ball that allows clairvoyant perception of anywhere in any dimension or realm. Other powerful artifacts in his possession include the Book of the Vishanti, the Darkhold tome, and the Wand of Watoomb. His abode in Greenwich Village known as the Sanctum Sanctorum, both defies normal spatial law and is of such magical potency in its protections that it may be considered an artifact itself. Doctor Strange has recently also come into the possession of the Soul Gem.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Earth-311</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"84248\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange.png\" title=\"Earth-311 1602\"><img id=\"84248\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/443/84248-97003-doctor-strange_thumb.png\" alt=\"Earth-311 1602\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-311 1602</div></div></div></div><p>Stephen Strange of the Marvel 1602 reality served as Queen Elizabeth I's magician and mystical adviser, taking the place of the historical figure John Dee.

Despite her father being upset, he decided she was smart and offered her to take over the family business, but Emma declined preffering to make her fortune herself.

However a new Sinister arrives saying he integrated the new data that the previous Sinisters received and shoots himself after teleporting his palace away.</p><p>The Dreaming Celestial's head reattaches to it's body as the rest of the Celestials land. Emma is about to be told to leave by Scott but cuts him short refusing to go. The team stares the Celestials down vowing to protect the Dreaming Celestial and Earth. A group of people gather looking at the X-men but they do nothing, no throwing things, no derogatory slurs. They only show fear which was Cyclops' initial plan all along. Emma's diamond arm was eventually reattached by a molecular weaving machine made by <a href=\"/x-club/65-56306/\">X-Club</a>.</p><p>Emma was seen training, getting back into to fighting condition after her arm reattachment. She had a brief conversation with Namor and left while noticing Scott was on edge about something. She was later deployed with the Extinction team to deal with the escapee prisoners from the Peak space prison station and when the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> showed up to deal with further escapees. She teams up with <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, Colossus and <a href=\"/thaddeus-ross/29-3457/\">Red Hulk</a> to face <a href=\"/xemnu/29-22523/\">Xemnu the Titan</a> While Colossus holds off Xemnu, Emma and Tony make a psiconic shielding device for the Red Hulk to protect him from Xemnu's telepathy. With the device complete, the combined might of Colossus and Red Hulk was enough to defeat the alien.</p><p>With Hope taken captive by <a href=\"/unit/29-4467/\">Unit</a>, the Extinction team takes leave from the Avengers to save Hope. Emma and the team are teleported there by Magik where Emma tries to invade Unit's mind. Unit uses a fake double mind, which is what he used in the first place to make a false mutant detection signal in order to draw out Hope, allowing him the chance to shoot a small laser at Emma stunning her. He then uses a pheromone barrage on her and Namor forcing them to become intimate on the battlefield which makes Scott angry and jealous causing him to blast Unit. With Unit's eventual defeat at the hands of Danger, the team returns home where Emma apologizes to Scott about what happened with her and Namor.

She was close to telepathically shutting down the the Avenger's mental defenses when Iron Man shows up using a nanotech taser cloud to block her telepathy. Emma is forced into her diamond form and is defeated shortly after until Magneto showed up saving her. Emma along with the other X-Men go into hiding after Hope runs off. They find out Hope is heading to the moon. Emma, and four other mutants, Cyclops, Magik, Colossus,and Namor, acquire a shard of the Phoenix thanks to Iron Man using a new armor to stop it from bonding with Hope. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five take Hope back to Earth in order to prepare for future events. They announce they will cleanse the Earth.</p><p>Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five fix the Earth by ending hunger, giving a never ending source of energy and outlaw war pax Utopia. Another scuffle with the Avengers occurs but the Scarlet Witch teleports a voluntary Hope and the Avengers away. Emma talks with Cyclops who goes on to say that despite all the good X-Men do and all the good they have done, mankind still hates and fears them. That they will always be pushed further into a corner and steal away their innocent despite being endangered so few. The humans will always send their \"heroes\" to attack the mutants and continue to push them around. She watches as Cyclops simply states \"No more Avengers.\" Emma and Namor talk about <a href=\"/transonic/29-72484/\">Transonic</a> being imprisoned. Namor is disgusted with it and Emma tells him she knows where the girl is. In what appears to be a manipulative moment for Emma, most likely due to the corruption and the power of the part of the Phoenix Force in her, kisses Namor and tells him Transonic is in Wakanda and that she, Emma, hasn't told Scott about her whereabouts.</p><p>With Magneto bringing Namor's actions to Scott's attention, he questions Emma. Emma tells him Namor is his own man and that Scott has no authority over him. Emma tells him to look at the benefit of what happened with the Avengers being found. Emma and the rest of the Phoenix Five go to Wakanda where in Namor's defeat, they absorb his share of the Phoenix Force. Emma calls for a meeting with Scott in the remote location of the Danakil Desert in Ethiopia. Emma and him talk and she goes on to say she has reached into every mind on Earth. Scott tells her that she needs to stop sounding like Namor and that this isn't a war and she needs to come home. Emma tells Scott that Hope is in <a href=\"/kun-lun/34-56104/\">K'un Lun.</a> Scott rushes off to retrieve Hope leaving Emma in mid-sentence begging for him to stop her as she is scared for what she might do next as the Phoenix Force's influence corrupts her further. She ends up making a man who had a hit and run accident with a thirteen year old mutant boy years ago and never reported it just because he was a mutant, brain dead. When Colossus and Magik fight, they manage to knock each other out in an attempt to gain the other's portion of the Phoenix Force. They are returned to their normal forms as their portions of the Phoenix Force leave them and presumably go to Emma and Scott.</p><p>Emma is now almost completely corrupted by the Phoenix Force. She has forced all the remaining X-Men to bow down and worship her. All but one resisted and that was Magneto. Emma explains that she is indeed the more powerful of the two which spites Magneto to contact Xavier saying both Emma and Scott are completely gone. Scott is in need of more power after his defeat at the hands of Hope taking the power of Iron Fist and Scarlet witch so he is heading after Emma.</p><h2><b>Personal Information</b></h2><h3><b>Physical Attributes</b></h3><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5'10\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 144 lbs.

Her psionic powers allow her to perform several feats such as mental communication, mind reading, mind control, induce paralysis, possession, hypnosis, pain stimulation, illusion casting, astral projection, psychic surgery, and by collecting ambient psionic energy she can create powerful psionic lightning bolts or \"psi-bolts\", that can attack on a physical or mental level and are capable of rendering a person unconscious or even killing them. Emma's telepathy is powerful enough to communicate and effect people all the way across the planet. She has even done a mental broadcasting of Cyclops' own thoughts to all of the remaining mutants that are left on the Earth</p><p>Emma has been stated to be an \"Omega Class Telepath\" (the same classification as Charles Xavier), a level 10 psi and one of the top five telepaths on Earth. Emma's telepathy manifested itself in her teens, and she has devoted her life to mastering her many psychic skills. Following the death of <a href=\"../../jean-grey/29-3552/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jean Grey</a> and the de-powering of Professor Xavier (though he has since regained his abilities), Emma has acted as the X-Men's primary telepath.</p><h4><b>Organic Diamond Form</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79624\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost.jpg\" title=\"Diamond Form\"><img id=\"79624\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/79624-149754-emma-frost_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Diamond Form\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Diamond Form</div></div></div></div><p>Emma gained a secondary mutation during the destruction of <a href=\"/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>, which manifested as complete transmutation of her organic tissues into a diamond-like substance. It was later revealed in a flashback that <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a> possibly catalyzed Emma's secondary mutation in order to allow her to survive the harsh environment of Genosha (however, it is still questionable if this is really true). This ability allows Emma to turn into an un-living yet sentient and mobile diamond form, granting her extreme resistance to damage, invulnerability to cold and heat, enhanced speed, super strength (no limit has been clearly defined but handbooks say approximately 2 tons), immortality, and limitless stamina as her body does not tire or produce any fatigue toxins while in this form. She also does not feel pain or emotions and has no need to eat, sleep, or drink while in diamond form. A drawback of her diamond form is she can not access her telepathy, but in return it grants her telepathic immunity to all but a few telepaths. She can stay transformed for as long as she likes and the speed it takes for her to transform in and out of her diamond form is almost instantaneous, being described as happening within a hundredth of a second.</p><p>Emma's diamond form has stood up to Cyclops' optic blasts, jet crashes, blasts from Bishop, hits from World War <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, the collapse of Genosha, and even a blast from the <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/29-22836/\">Dreaming Celestial</a>'s head when it was taken over by Mr. Sinister. Emma can be broken if hit with the appropriate amount of force, appropriate weapon and her shatter point (believed to be her nose). Her first instance of entirely shattering was due to a diamond bullet hitting her in her shatter point at extremely high speeds. In her second instance of breaking (this did not involve her shatter point), Emma's arm was cut off when attacked by one of the Dreaming Celestial's \"mini celestial\" probes its body broke into. Despite her arm breaking off, this shows an impressive upper limit to the kind of damage her diamond form can take.</p><h3><b><u>Abilities</u></b></h3><h4>Gifted Intellect</h4><p>Emma is extremely intelligent and cunning, allowing her to traverse the ranks of business, the Hellfire Club, and the X-Men, as well as acquire a great deal of wealth. Her persuasive manner and abilities can easily sway others to do anything in her favor, especially when this skill is backed up with her telepathy.</p><p>Emma has also spent a great deal of time mentoring young mutants, granting her tremendous knowledge in mutant powers and how they work. When she possessed Iceman's body, she was able to use his powers in ways he had never been capable of before. Emma was the one that discovered Cyclops' inability to control his optic blasts was actually the result of mental blocks that Scott imposed on himself at a young age (and not physical brain damage, as was previously believed) and performed 'psychic surgery' that allowed him to control his powers for a time.</p><h4>Expert Technician</h4><p>Emma Frost is highly skilled in electronic theory and electronics, and has learned how to build devices that can amplify psionic energy and utilize psionic energy for various effects. She devised the mechanism by which <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a> projected his illusions directly into the mind of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a>.</p><h4>Defense Training</h4><p>Emma is a capable fighter in her own right. She has held her own while in diamond form in a fight against both <a href=\"/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a> and <a href=\"/sage/29-4559/\">Sage</a>, until Bishop was forced to blast her away from the battlefield. She defeated half a dozen Sinister men with no powers for training.

Due to her wealthy background, she is placed on the <a href=\"/human-council/65-57422/\">Higher Council</a> along with <a href=\"../../moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moira MacTaggert</a>, <a href=\"../../bolivar-trask/29-15923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bolivar Trask,</a> <a href=\"../../mariko-yashida/29-3196/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mariko Yashida</a> and <a href=\"../../captain-britain/29-7477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brian Braddock</a>.

Xavier and Frost became romantically involved while Xavier was still in a relationship with Mystique, causing Mystique to angrily lash out at Xavier in a grotesque form until Emma had to diamond-punch her. Emma was even responsible for the naming of Xavier's cat, saying it should be named Mystique when it destroyed his office in a similar manner to the actual Mystique. Emma and Charles, however, didn\u2019t make it as a couple. Frost leaves Xavier for mostly ideological differences as she thinks his approach to the mutant/human relation was too violent. Frost is more passive towards working on the mutant/human relation then Xavier. Frost goes back to Chicago and becomes a teacher giving mutant education seminars. The governor is very supportive of Frost's idea and helped introduce her to the <a href=\"../../white-house/34-56318/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White House</a> chief of staff and eventually met the President.</p><p>They come up with the New Mutants which is supposed to help educate humans about mutants while cutting ties with Xavies.

In Chicago, she creates a new program called Academy of Tomorrow (the X-Men-like squad of the school being the Ultimate version of the New Mutants). She was later shown to be dating Shinobi Shaw (son of the deceased leader of the club, Sebastian Shaw). After Shinobi is arrested for attacking Jean Grey in order to release the Phoenix Force she was revealed to be the White Queen of this universe's Hellfire Club (wearing an outfit highly similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen garb) and requesting a new boyfriend. During the <a href=\"../../ultimatum/39-55745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum</a> event, she is later confirmed dead by <a href=\"../../madrox/29-7910/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Madrox</a> in issue #3.</p><p>This version of Emma dresses more modestly and professionally than her mainstream counterpart, with even her initial outfit similar to her mainstream counterpart's White Queen costume showing very little skin. It is only when she is revealed as the White Queen that she wears the more revealing attire recognizable by her alternate counterpart. She also wore glasses most of the time (including as the White Queen). She also displays only her diamond form and is not shown using telepathy, though she was silenced before mentioning other powers.</p><h3><b>House of M (Earth-58163)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"204261\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204261-161199-cyclops.jpg\" title=\"House of M\"><img id=\"204261\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204261-161199-cyclops_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"House of M\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">House of M</div></div></div></div><p>During the events of <a href=\"../../house-of-m/39-40991/\" rel=\"nofollow\">House of M</a>, Emma is a child therapist and is happily married to Cyclops and they have three kids.

Emma also refused Cyclops proposals stating her desire to avoid the \"tedious scandal\" so it would not cause any issues between the two of them. After a misunderstanding for being blamed for the deaths of the passengers in Hindenburg Disaster, the government placed the X-Society under house arrest so Emma migrated to <a href=\"../../europe/34-56099/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Europe</a> and was married to Cyclops.</p><h3><b>Age of Xavier (Earth-77995)</b></h3><p>Emma is a member of the Hellfire Club and is married to Iceman.

Emma played an important role to the team as she used her telepathy to mentally communicate with other super humans who aims to look for the cure. With her telepathy, the Vi-Locks were unable to detect how they communicate. Emma is paraplegic and uses a wheelchair.</p><h3><b>New Exiles</b></h3><p>This version is known as Dame Emma Frost. She was the founder of Force X and head of Department X.</p><h3><b>Old Man Logan</b></h3><p>Emma tricks others by using her telepathy to make herself appear young to others.

As she one of the last remaining members of the X-Men, she had seen many of her friends and comrades die at the hands of <a href=\"../../dust/29-4555/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dust</a>, including her lover who was presumably Cyclops.

She successfully located Charles Xavier's lifeless body in the heart of Magneto's Genosha, but later attempts to locate Jean Grey were less successful. In an effort to remain on the team she informs Cyclops that \u201cgiven time I could locate her, but if [Wolverine] has his way I\u2019ll be gone tomorrow\u201d. Frost is intelligent and tactical, and is an extremely powerful telepath. Her first telepathic fight as an X-Man was against the Shadow King.

However, in reality she was tearing the country apart with rain storms and tornadoes.</p><p>It was Emma's telepathic powers that saved Storm's life, the whole continent of Africa, and eventually defeat the Shadow King.

However, she is extremely secretive and on one occasion lied to Wolverine about Forge's availability. She also appears to be fond of Cyclops, often watching him from afar. Cyclops is still depressed for the loss of Jean Grey. Emma offered to delete his memories of Jean and make him normal again.</p><p>Emma betrays the X-Men after Jean is found. It is revealed that she has been working for the Inner Circle in an attempt to destroy the Phoenix Force. The Inner Circle then double crosses Emma and tries to use the Phoenix for their own ends. It, however proves too powerful for them to control. When the Phoenix Force is released and is searching for Jean, Emma traps it in her body, transforms into diamond and projects it into the atmosphere where it cannot find a host. She manages to ask Cyclops to forgive her before shattering and seemingly dies.</p><h3><b><u>Film</u></b></h3><h4><b><a href=\"/generation-x/223-248/\">Generation X</a></b></h4><p>Emma Frost was played by Finola Hughes in a made-for-TV adaptation of Generation X on FOX. Emma was a mentor for the Generation X alongside with Banshee. Together with her team, they fought a mad scientist who wants to gain psychic powers. She also handled a group of mutants called Hellions who died and blamed herself. It caused her to be strict to the team and makes sure they are working good. Before she became a teacher, she works on a dream machine project and gained rivalry with Russel Tresh.</p><h4><b><a href=\"/x-men-origins-wolverine/223-25/\">X-Men Origins: Wolverine</a></b></h4><p>Emma Frost appears briefly in this film and is played by Tahyna Tozzi. Emma Frost is present in Wolverine's past and she is a mutant with the ability to turn her body in diamond form. She does not display telepathy.

She is shown to be the White Queen of the Hellfire Club lead by Sebastian Shaw. She is first shown when Moria MacTaggert sneaks into the Hellfire Club's quarters looking for Colonel Hendry. She is next seen going to meet with a Russian general who Shaw is supposed to meet. Professor Xavier and Magneto also infiltrate the building Emma is in and confront her. She is then captured and taken to the CIA headquarters. Months later, Magneto and his Brotherhood free her from her prison and ask her to join them, to which she agrees. She displays incredibly impressive telepathy defeating and blocking out Charles Xavier several times. She also possesses her diamond form which seems to augment her strength (she was able to send Erik flying into the sea with a single blow) and renders her immune to telepathy. However it does not seem to provide her any physical durability as Erik almost killed her by strangling her with the metal railing of a bed while she was in diamond form (a close up clearly shows it beginning to shatter around the area the pressure was applied, her neck) and Charles had to persuade him not to kill her, which he surely would have. In this incarnation, Emma seems to play more of a henchman-type second-in-command role rather than more of an equal power player as she was in the comics when she was the White Queen.</p><h3><b><u>Video Games</u></b></h3><h4><b>X-Men Legends</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1928643\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1928643-emma_frost1_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Legends Emma\"><img id=\"1928643\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/74811/1928643-emma_frost1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Legends Emma\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Legends Emma</div></div></div></div><p>Emma Frost is a playable character in X-Men Legends.

She is voiced by Bobby Holliday.</p><h4><b>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse</b></h4><p>She also appeared in it's sequel as a NPC who helped the X-Men in their mission in Madri Temple after she telepathically contacted Professor X about the Stepford Cuckoos starting rebellion in Madri.

Scott later discovered that <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> had played many roles in his formative years, including those of Mr. Milbury and the head doctor at the orphanage, as well as the orphan bullies 'Nathan Masters' and 'Lefty'. As Lefty, he tormented Scott, often by killing his potential foster parents. When Scott befriended staff member Robyn Hanover, due to their shared interest in planes, Sinister brainwashed her so that she would be cold like all the other staff.</p><p>When Scott was fifteen years old, he ran away from the orphanage and found a mutant named <a href=\"/jack-odiamonds/29-19209/\">Jack O'Diamonds</a>, who became a father figure to him. Jack wanted Scott to help him break into the nuclear power plant which had triggered his mutant abilities in the first place. Scott only agreed to help because he knew that Jack would kill the guards if he didn't. <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Xavier</a> heard of the break in and tried to stop them. Eventually, Jack was defeated by Xavier with help from Scott. Professor X offered Scott the opportunity to join the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>. He accepted so that Xavier would teach him to control his power and adopted the code name \"Cyclops\", becoming the first X-Man.</p><p>Professor X provided Cyclops with a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ruby-quartz/18-55652/\">ruby quartz</a> visor to help him restrain his destructive optic blasts. Cyclops never gained full control of his power, but he finally had a means to use it with confidence. He soon met his new teammates, other mutants his age. Cyclops bonded very well with the group, who gave him the nickname \"Slim\" Summers due to his thin build. Together, they became the original five X-Men. Cyclops was given the role of field leader by Professor X, and the two developed a strong father-son relationship.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cyclops was created by writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> in 1963. He made his debut appearance in the X-Men's first title, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-x-men/37-6694/\">X-Men #1</a>. Originally dubbed Slim Summers, his name was changed to Scott by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-beware-the-blob/37-6946/\">X-Men #3</a>, with \"Slim\" becoming his nickname.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1353567\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/1353567-cyclops1_super.jpg\" title=\"The First X-Man\"><img id=\"1353567\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/1353567-cyclops1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The First X-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The First X-Man</div></div></div></div><p>Since the founding of the X-Men, Cyclops has been a stalwart field leader and one of the mutant team's most iconic members. Chosen by Professor Xavier as his successor to lead the X-Men and carry on his ideals, a heavy burden was placed on Scott's shoulders from a young age. Over the years he has grown from a taciturn young man who lacked confidence in himself and his abilities into a powerful and capable leader, becoming one of the most important figures in the Marvel Universe. Strong-willed, self-disciplined, and fearlessly loyal, Cyclops possesses tremendous leadership abilities and great tactical and strategic skills. In many ways Cyclops <i>is</i> the X-Men, representing their ideal. Cyclops' dedication towards making Xavier's dream of peaceful coexistence between mutants and humans a reality has been a driving force in his life for many years, and this loyalty has at times cost him dearly in his relationships with others.</p><p>Scott eventually emerged from Xavier's shadow as the X-Men's undisputed leader. He also became co-headmaster of the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a> alongside his lover, <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>. Succeeding Professor X as the authority figure of the X-Men caused significant change in Cyclops' character. No longer defined by his strict adherence to Xavier's ideology, Cyclops has become far more confident, audacious, and pragmatic. As leader of the X-Men, he has had to embrace his own vision for the future of mutantkind in a world that fears and hates them.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>First Class</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"512303\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/512303-xmen04_super.jpg\" title=\"Original X-Men\"><img id=\"512303\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/14751/512303-xmen04_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Original X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Original X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Sensing that he had the qualities of a natural born leader (and believing that he needed something to work towards), Professor X made Cyclops deputy leader of the X-Men. Cyclops was such an efficient leader, that for a short while he led the X-Men without Xavier. Although he was dedicated to leading the X-Men, Cyclops soon fell in love with his teammate Jean Grey, aka <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Marvel Girl</a>. Scott feared starting a relationship, afraid of hurting someone with his uncontrollable power. He was also a bit insecure about his physical appearance, believing Jean would prefer to date the handsome <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Warren</a>. Jean soon realized that she also had feelings for Scott, and they started a relationship. They became almost inseparable. Even when Xavier was thought to be dead, and the X-Men split up, Scott and Jean stayed together.</p><h3>Enter Havok</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"469669\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/469669-havok_00.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops' brother, Havok\"><img id=\"469669\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/469669-havok_00_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops' brother, Havok\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops' brother, Havok</div></div></div></div><p>After the original five X-Men were formed, Cyclops' long lost brother <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Alex</a> was discovered. Like Cyclops, he had developed a highly destructive mutant power which was detected by <a href=\"../../cerebro/18-15073/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cerebro</a>. Adopting the code name \"Havok\", Alex became a member of the X-Men. An unusual genetic quirk existed between the two brothers, with neither of them able to hurt the other with their mutant powers. Instead, they would absorb the energy the other directed at them. However, as Cyclops was more tactically minded and experienced in battle, he would always best Havok in brotherly scraps.</p><h3>Second Genesis</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"771745\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/771745-140_uncanny_x_men__first_cl_super.jpg\" title=\"All-New, All-Different\"><img id=\"771745\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/771745-140_uncanny_x_men__first_cl_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"All-New, All-Different\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">All-New, All-Different</div></div></div></div><p>The original X-Men reformed under <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>, but they were defeated and captured by the living island <a href=\"/krakoa/29-26409/\">Krakoa</a>. The Professor assembled a new team of mutants to save his original X-Men. Cyclops' long lost brother <a href=\"/vulcan/29-21233/\">Kid Vulcan</a> was one of the members. The team failed, and was believed to be dead. Cyclops had managed to escape, but had lost his <a href=\"/ruby-quartz/18-55652/\">ruby quartz</a> visor and his power was inactive. Using the X-Men's jet, he made his way to Professor X for help. Xavier was distraught by the death of the team, and by his own failure, so he wiped all knowledge of the team from Cyclops' mind including all knowledge of his brother. Another team of international X-Men was assembled by Xavier, with Cyclops leading them back to battle Krakoa. The new team successfully rescued the original X-Men. However, the old team decided to leave both the mansion and the X-Men behind, moving on now that they had matured.</p><p>Cyclops chose to remain at the school, for fear his uncontrollable power wouldn't allow him to fit into society. He continued to be Xavier's deputy leader, and acted as field leader to the new team of X-Men. The team was not initially as tight-knit as the original X-Men, despite the hard training Cyclops put them through. <a href=\"/thunderbird/29-2174/\">Thunderbird</a> was killed during the new team's second mission against <a href=\"/count-nefaria/29-3229/\">Count Nefaria</a> and his <a href=\"/ani-men/65-2508/\">Ani-Men</a>, which haunted Cyclops and made him question his ability to lead.</p><h3>The Phoenix Rises</h3><p>Despite the departure of the original X-Men, Cyclops continued to date Marvel Girl. He found that he had a new rival for her affections in the form of <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. The Canadian X-Man had a much wilder personality compared to the disciplined Cyclops, and he was quite open about his attraction to Jean. Shortly after she left the X-Men, Jean was kidnapped by <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a> along with Professor X, Wolverine, and <a href=\"/banshee/29-9708/\">Banshee</a>, and taken to an abandoned <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> space station. There, the anti-mutant activist <a href=\"/steven-lang/29-14861/\">Steven Lang</a> unveiled his plans for an all new generation of Sentinels. The X-Men arrived to defeat Lang and rescue their teammates, but their escape shuttle was damaged.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2009403\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55309/2009403-jean_grey_as_phoenix_1_100k_super.jpg\" title=\"Birth of the Phoenix\"><img id=\"2009403\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55309/2009403-jean_grey_as_phoenix_1_100k_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Birth of the Phoenix\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Birth of the Phoenix</div></div></div></div><p>A solar storm began to leak lethal radiation into the shuttle as the X-Men made their way back to Earth. Jean volunteered to pilot the shuttle, absorbing the knowledge to operate it from <a href=\"/peter-corbeau/29-13362/\">Dr. Peter Corbeau</a> and using her telekinesis to shield herself from the radiation. The other X-Men were placed in stasis for their protection. However, Jean started to succumb to the radiation's lethal effects. The cosmic entity known as the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a> responded to Jean's anguished telepathic call. The Phoenix Force reformed itself after Jean's own image and consciousness, then placed her in suspended animation in a cocoon at the bottom of Jamaica Bay. The shuttle reentered the Earth's atmosphere, crashing in Jamaica Bay. The X-Men swam safely to the surface, but there was no sign of Marvel Girl. Suddenly, the water erupted, and the \"Phoenix\" emerged in Jean's form. She declared herself \"fire and life incarnate\" to the X-Men, before collapsing.</p><h3>Enter Corsair</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"148093\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/148093-130344-corsair.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops' father, Corsair\"><img id=\"148093\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/148093-130344-corsair_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops' father, Corsair\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops' father, Corsair</div></div></div></div><p>While Phoenix lay in the hospital, the X-Men went to the <a href=\"/mkraan-crystal/18-44426/\">M'Kraan Crystal</a>'s homeworld to battle the <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a> <a href=\"/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">Imperial Guard</a>. There they came in contact with a band of space pirates known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/starjammers/65-14871/\">Starjammers</a>. The captain of the Starjammers was a man known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/corsair/29-7591/\">Corsair</a>. Cyclops and Corsair resented each other, though they also admired each others' leadership skills. Years later it was discovered that Corsair was Christopher Summers, the father of Cyclops and Havok. It transpired that Christopher and his wife Katherine Anne were taken from their burning plane by a group of intergalactic slavers. Katherine had died at the hands of the evil Shi'ar despot <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dken/29-40902/\">D'Ken</a>, while Christopher managed to escape and fight D'Ken's regime with his small band of pirates under the re-imagined persona of Corsair.</p><h3>Cyclops and Phoenix</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"79719\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/79719-193358-proteus_super.jpg\" title=\"Proteus\"><img id=\"79719\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/79719-193358-proteus_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Proteus\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Proteus</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops believed that the Phoenix was <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean</a>, and maintained a relationship with her. However, he started to privately question their relationship, feeling that the reborn Jean was not the same Jean he had fallen in love with. When Cyclops thought that the Phoenix was dead for a period of time after they were separated in the Savage Land, he felt unable to mourn her. Believing this meant that he no longer loved Jean, Cyclops briefly dated <a href=\"/colleen-wing/29-1494/\">Colleen Wing</a>. The Phoenix was reunited with Cyclops when the X-Men stopped <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a>'s mutant son, <a href=\"/proteus/29-2165/\">Proteus</a>, from destroying reality. Cyclops rediscovered his love for Phoenix, and they shared a romantic kiss on the way home. Cyclops was impressed with Phoenix's new found level of control over her immense powers. She created a special 'psychic bond' between herself and Cyclops, so they could always contact each other. After a battle with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> over the recruitment of the mutant pop star <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a>, Phoenix and Cyclops shared an intimate night together.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"690207\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/690207-phoenix15_super.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix allows Cyclops to see without his visor\"><img id=\"690207\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/690207-phoenix15_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix allows Cyclops to see without his visor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phoenix allows Cyclops to see without his visor</div></div></div></div><p>Phoenix flew them both to a deserted area, where she removed Cyclops' <a href=\"/ruby-quartz/18-55652/\">ruby quartz</a> visor, and told him to open his eyes. Although wary at first, Cyclops eventually opened his eyes and realized that he could see Phoenix without needing the visor to hold back his optic blasts. Phoenix had used her telekinesis to keep Cyclops' powers in check. It was the first time since puberty that Cyclops was able to see without the aid of ruby quartz. The couple embraced, kissed, and made love in the lonely desert.</p><h3><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-phoenix-saga/39-42183/\">Dark Phoenix Saga</a></b></h3><p>Phoenix soon began to experience realistic illusions where she lived in 18th century <a href=\"/england/34-55794/\">England</a> and was betrothed to a man known only as Nikos. She didn't confide in Cyclops what had been happening to her. It turned out that the old X-Men foe, <a href=\"/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, had his powers of illusion boosted by a psionic mind-tap device created by the Hellfire Club's White Queen, <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>. Mastermind had been creating the illusions in Phoenix's mind, making her believe that she was his 18th century lover, <a href=\"/lady-grey/29-45203/\">Lady Grey</a>. Phoenix had even assumed the role of the Hellfire Club's new Black Queen. She relished in all the decadent freedom and power that the position afforded her, but Cyclops remained in contact with Jean through their special psychic bond as the X-Men battled the Hellfire Club over the soul of the Phoenix.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"152082\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/152082-13553-dark-phoenix-saga_super.jpg\" title=\"Dark Phoenix\"><img id=\"152082\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/152082-13553-dark-phoenix-saga_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dark Phoenix\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dark Phoenix</div></div></div></div><p>Using this connection, Cyclops engaged Mastermind in a psychic duel when the X-Men came to rescue Phoenix. Mastermind defeated Cyclops. Cyclops' defeat broke Mastermind's hold over Phoenix's psyche, but also any control Jean had over the Phoenix. Transformed into the <a href=\"/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Dark Phoenix</a>, she quickly defeated Mastermind by devastating his mind with her godlike powers before flying into space. While the Phoenix represented the light and life of the universe, the Dark Phoenix represented power and destruction. Flying to a distant galaxy, the Dark Phoenix devoured the star of the <a href=\"/dbari/65-57681/\">D'Bari</a> system to sate its hunger for power, killing billions of innocent people in the process. The Shi'ar Empress <a href=\"/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a> was alerted and summoned an intergalactic council that included the <a href=\"/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a> and <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull</a> empires. They concluded that, for the rest of the universe to live, the Dark Phoenix must be destroyed. The fate of Jean Grey had been decided.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> had found a way to temporarily neutralize Phoenix's power. When Dark Phoenix returned to Earth, the X-Men held her at bay while <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> worked to rebuild the mental blocks in her brain that Mastermind had broken down. The Phoenix threatened to kill all of them, but Cyclops kept trying to reach out to her. Eventually the Phoenix returned to normal and Cyclops finally proposed to her, just as they are teleported away by the Shi'ar to their flagship. Lilandra announced that the Phoenix, who everyone believed to be Jean, had to die. Unwilling to let one his students be killed, Xavier challenged Lilandra (who he was romantically involved with) to a duel she couldn't refuse. Professor X named the X-Men as his champions, while Lilandra named her <a href=\"/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">Imperial Guard</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"581164\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/581164-logan1_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops and Phoenix\"><img id=\"581164\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/581164-logan1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops and Phoenix\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops and Phoenix</div></div></div></div><p>The battle took place the next day on the <a href=\"/blue-area-of-the-moon/34-56921/\">Blue Area of the Moon</a>. The Imperial Guard quickly defeated the X-Men, leaving Cyclops and Phoenix to make a final stand. The battle triggered Phoenix's transformation into Dark Phoenix once more. Lilandra ordered Plan Omega, which would destroy the entire solar system in hopes of eliminating Dark Phoenix. Professor X ordered the X-Men to subdue Phoenix so this would not be necessary. After the X-Men managed to subdue Phoenix, she realized that she would never be able to control herself and fled to a back alley. Cyclops chased after her, but Phoenix subdued him by using her telekinesis. She told Cyclops that she was losing control and that there was only one way to prevent the Dark Phoenix from taking dominance again. Phoenix then activated an ancient Kree energy weapon and, after bidding Cyclops an emotional farewell, sacrificed herself. Cyclops and the X-Men mourned.</p><h3>X-Man No More</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1299756\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/1299756-aleytys_forrester10.jpg\" title=\"Scott with Lee Forrester\"><img id=\"1299756\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/1299756-aleytys_forrester10_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Scott with Lee Forrester\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Scott with Lee Forrester</div></div></div></div><p>The Shi'ar allowed the remaining X-Men to return to Earth. However, Cyclops struggled to continue being an X-Man while he grieved for the woman he loved. He soon after left the X-Men to travel on his own. For a time Cyclops traveled as a ship's mate on board <a href=\"/lee-forrester/29-31320/\">Lee Forrester</a>'s boat. They became close, but Cyclops was still in mourning for Jean. When they went to Lee's family home, Cyclops observed Lee's father being murdered by <a href=\"/dspayre/29-42543/\">D'Spayre</a>. Cyclops had to reveal his mutant power in order to save Lee from D'Spayre.

At their airport, Cyclops was introduced to one of their pilots, a red-headed young woman named <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a>. Her physical resemblance to Jean was uncanny, and Scott soon fell in love with her. It was a whirlwind romance for Cyclops and Maddie. It wasn't long before they were married, and Maddie became pregnant with their son. Cyclops returned to the X-Men with Maddie at his side. Once there, he struggled to maintain a healthy balance between his role as an X-Man and that of a husband and soon-to-be father. Scott resumed leadership of the X-Men and took the team to <a href=\"/asgard-marvel/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> to rescue the <a href=\"/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>. After their return to Earth, they went to <a href=\"/france/34-55778/\">France</a> to fend off the riots outside of <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>'s trial for his crimes as a terrorist. Magneto was successfully pardoned for his crime, and joined with the X-Men.</p><p>While Cyclops was away from the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">mansion</a> with the X-Men, Maddie was left alone. During her solitude in the mansion, her water broke and she gave birth to their son in the kitchen of the mansion. Without Cyclops' agreement, she named the boy <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Nathan</a>. This caused an intense argument between Maddie and Cyclops. Cyclops had wanted to name his son <a href=\"/corsair/29-7591/\">Christopher</a> <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles</a>, after the two fathers in his life, with the name \"Nathan\" reminding him of the <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">bully</a> from the orphanage where he grew up.</p><h3>Cyclops vs. Storm</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"204265\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204265-81668-cyclops_super.jpg\" title=\"The duel for leadership\"><img id=\"204265\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204265-81668-cyclops_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The duel for leadership\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The duel for leadership</div></div></div></div><p>With the argument over the baby's name still fresh in his mind, Cyclops was forced to confront whether or not he was still able to lead the X-Men. During his absence from the team, <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> had successfully acted as field leader in Cyclops' place. Even though she had lost her mutant powers, Storm challenged Cyclops to a one-on-one duel in the <a href=\"/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a> for leadership of the X-Men. The fight was short-lived, as Storm quickly removed Cyclops' ruby quartz visor, rendering him unable to control his power. Cyclops conceded defeat and left the X-Men once more. Together with Madelyne, and their baby, he traveled back to Alaska. Madelyne resumed working for the Summers family airline, and Cyclops also began working for the family business. However, he clearly wasn't happy with his new domestic life.</p><h3>The Return of Jean Grey</h3><p>While Cyclops was living in Alaska with his family, the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> made a marvelous discovery. Hidden on the floor of Jamaica Bay was a stone cocoon. It transpired that <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Marvel Girl</a> had been placed in a catatonic state, and left in the stone pod to protect her while a cosmic being known as the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix</a> replaced her.

Marvel Girl couldn't understand why the world had changed so much, that their <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">mentor</a> had abandoned them to live in space while their former foe Magneto was leading the X-Men. The others had grown tired of trying to fit in to regular everyday life, and with Jean's miraculous return from the dead they decided to reform the original team of X-Men.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"686767\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/686767-love16_super.jpg\" title=\"Scott and Jean reunited\"><img id=\"686767\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/686767-love16_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Jean reunited\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Scott and Jean reunited</div></div></div></div><p>When they made the phone call to Cyclops to inform him of Marvel Girl's return, he was in the middle of an argument with Madelyne. Their relationship had grown distant and unhappy. Cyclops spent hours out in the yard using his power to chop firewood in order to avoid spending time with his family. Maddie gave him an ultimatum, if he left to go back to New York then he should never return. Without a word, Cyclops walked out the door and took the first plane back to New York. Back in the city, he was reunited with his first love. However, he could not passionately embrace Marvel Girl, as he felt burdened by the guilt of leaving his wife and child. Cyclops soon discovered that Marvel Girl only possessed her telekinetic abilities, she had lost her telepathy and could not read his mind. Cyclops chose not to inform Jean about Madelyne or his infant son. Instead he maintained a stoic distance from her that continued to upset and frustrate her.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"80322\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/80322-99000-x-factor.jpg\" title=\"X-Factor\"><img id=\"80322\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/80322-99000-x-factor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>With all five of the original X-Men reunited, they decided to team-up and fight for mutant rights once more. Angel's old friend from college, <a href=\"/cameron-hodge/29-13379/\">Cameron Hodge</a>, agreed to manage their finances and convinced them to pose as mutant hunters. <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> became known as a group of humans who hunted mutants. The general public would be encouraged to telephone their hot line with reports of mutant activity. X-Factor would go to the scene and rescue frightened mutants and take them back to their headquarters to train them. Hodge, however, would later turn out to not be as benevolent towards the mutant cause as he appeared.</p><h3>Guilty Husband</h3><p>Cyclops soon became a victim to his own guilt, as well as the cruel machinations of both <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Sinister</a> and Cameron Hodge (who secretly hated mutants). When Scott went to Alaska to visit his estranged wife and child, he found the work of Sinister's <a href=\"/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a>. The house had been thoroughly cleansed of all signs that Madelyne and Scott had ever lived there. At the airline, all the staff had been replaced and all the files on Madelyne had been destroyed. Cyclops couldn't find any trace that his wife and child had ever existed.</p><p>As his sanity began to spiral out of control, he found a grave marked for Madelyne. Cyclops began to hallucinate, seeing the ghost of Jean, who merged into the Phoenix and then into Maddie. Frustrated and upset, Scott shot through the apparition with his powers. The red beam was seen by a local police officer, who took Cyclops along for questioning. However, they were then attacked by a <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a>.</p><p>Cyclops convinced the officer to release him from his handcuffs and hide while he battled the sentinel. After defeating the sentinel Cyclops was thanked by the police officer, who took him back to the house. Cyclops started to think that he was going mad, until he found one of Nathan's toys that had fallen behind the radiator. Cyclops returned to New York, determined to find out what was happening. However, his mental health was becoming unstable and he had grown convinced that Marvel Girl was really the Phoenix.</p><h3>Mental Breakdown</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"228459\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/228459-86913-dark-phoenix_super.jpg\" title=\"Taunted by the Phoenix\"><img id=\"228459\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9116/228459-86913-dark-phoenix_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Taunted by the Phoenix\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Taunted by the Phoenix</div></div></div></div><p>Cameron Hodge discovered this, and planted a holographic projection of the Phoenix in Cyclops' computer. When Cyclops turned on his computer, the holographic image emerged from the monitor and taunted him. The image even assumed the forms of both Madelyne and Jean in an effort to make Cyclops think that the Phoenix had been both all along. The hologram disappeared just as Marvel Girl entered the room, confusing Cyclops all the more. Cyclops grabbed Jean, demanding that she stop playing with his mind. After blasting parts of the building, Cyclops told Jean to hold his powers back like she had done when he made love to her in the desert. Despite Jean's protests that she wasn't the Phoenix, Cyclops chose to remove his visor.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"690184\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/690184-jean22.jpg\" title=\"Leech removes Cyclops' power temporarily\"><img id=\"690184\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/690184-jean22_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Leech removes Cyclops' power temporarily\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Leech removes Cyclops' power temporarily</div></div></div></div><p>Amazingly, his eyes didn't fire their destructive concussive force. However, Scott's moment of rapture was short lived when he realized that the young mutant <a href=\"/leech/29-3193/\">Leech</a> was nearby. Leech had used his own mutation to temporarily remove Cyclops' power. The other young wards of X-Factor raced to the scene with Iceman and Beast. Inspecting the computer, they discover the hologram of the Phoenix. Realizing what had happened, Cyclops was forced to accept the reality that Marvel Girl wasn't Phoenix and apologized for his actions.</p><h3>The Hunt for Nathan Christopher Summers</h3><p>With his secrets about his estranged wife and child finally revealed, Cyclops continued to work with X-Factor to save young mutants while also searching for his missing family with Marvel Girl's help. X-Factor had been publicly revealed as mutants, but because they struggled at their own cost to save lives of New Yorkers after <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>'s attack, they were accepted as local heroes. What Cyclops didn't know was that <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne</a> had been on the run from the <a href=\"/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a>. Her journey took her to <a href=\"/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a>, where she crossed paths with the X-Men. They saved her and took her back to their new base in <a href=\"/australia/34-55838/\">Australia</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"102560\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/102560-136366-greg-land_super.jpg\" title=\"Mr. Sinister\"><img id=\"102560\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/102560-136366-greg-land_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mr. Sinister\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mr. Sinister</div></div></div></div><p>While X-Factor had been battling the <a href=\"/horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\">Four Horsemen</a> in New York, the X-Men appeared to sacrifice their lives in <a href=\"/dallas/34-57351/\">Dallas</a>. A television news crew filmed the events, showing Madelyne's impassioned plea to Cyclops for him to find baby <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Nathan Christopher</a>. Cyclops and Marvel Girl traveled to Alaska to visit the orphanage where Cyclops had grown up. There, they uncovered <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>'s secret laboratories hidden underneath the building. Inside were mutant children, including <a href=\"/gailyn-bailey/29-45191/\">Gailyn</a> and <a href=\"/joey-bailey/29-45192/\">Joey Bailey</a>, Marvel Girl's missing niece and nephew. When they finally found Nathan he was being kept unconscious in a pod along with other mutant babies. Cyclops and Marvel Girl were then attacked by the <a href=\"/nanny/29-7567/\">Nanny</a> and her <a href=\"/orphan-maker/29-25911/\">Orphan Maker</a>. While fighting to stop Nanny from kidnapping Gailyn and Joey, demons suddenly appeared and kidnapped Nathan. Marvel Girl was forced to leave her family in order to save Cyclops' son.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/inferno/39-41408/\">Inferno</a></b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"807985\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/807985-madelyne_jean1_super.jpg\" title=\"The Goblin Queen\"><img id=\"807985\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/807985-madelyne_jean1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Goblin Queen\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Goblin Queen</div></div></div></div><p>The demons took baby Nathan to <a href=\"/nastirh/29-42869/\">N'astirh</a>. The demon sorcerer had corrupted Madelyne's feelings of despair, transforming her into the <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Goblin Queen</a>. With her growing telepathic and telekinetic powers, the Goblin Queen sent her hordes of demons to find her missing son. She wanted her revenge on Scott by destroying the only evidence of their marriage, she was going to murder Nathan. Cyclops and <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Marvel Girl</a> returned to New York and were reunited with the other members of X-Factor. There, they were forced to battle the demon-possessed members of the X-Men. Wolverine gladly battled Cyclops, which distracted Cyclops from saving his son. Eventually, the X-Men overcame their demonic urges and the two mutant teams joined forces to fight their common enemy. They pursued the Goblin Queen into her growing tower above <a href=\"/manhattan/34-57225/\">Manhattan</a>. Cyclops was forced to battle his brother <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a>, who had become the \"Goblin Prince\", Madelyne's new lover. Marvel Girl fought against Madelyne.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"850381\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38185/850381-madelyne01_super.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix enters Madelyne\"><img id=\"850381\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38185/850381-madelyne01_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix enters Madelyne\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phoenix enters Madelyne</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops defeated Havok, and Marvel Girl managed to defeat the Goblin Queen. As Madelyne lay dying in Marvel Girl's arms, she passed all of her memories and parts of the <a href=\"/phoenix-force/29-2164/\">Phoenix Force</a> into Marvel Girl's mind. Madelyne's memories informed Marvel Girl of who had been the real mastermind behind her existence. <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> had cloned Jean, but the clone remained lifeless. After the Phoenix died on the moon, the Force approached the lifeless body of Jean Grey on the floor of Jamaica Bay. When Jean unconsciously rejected the Phoenix it found another host, the body of Jean's clone. When the Phoenix animated the clone's body, Sinister implanted her with false memories and gave her the name Madelyne Pryor. He then placed her in <a href=\"/alaska/34-55827/\">Alaska</a>, where she was guaranteed to meet and become romantically involved with Cyclops.</p><p>However, Madelyne retained the Phoenix's replicated telepathic and telekinetic abilities. Madelyne hadn't realized it, but for years she had been using her powers on a subconscious level. She had even been the actual cause of Cyclops' surprising defeat when <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> challenged him for leadership of the X-Men. However, without the same experience Jean Grey had, Madelyne slowly became corrupted by her powers. Marvel Girl led the X-Men and X-Factor to the site of the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a> where they confronted Mr. Sinister for the first time.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"204178\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204178-108084-cyclops_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops blasts Sinister\"><img id=\"204178\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204178-108084-cyclops_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops blasts Sinister\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops blasts Sinister</div></div></div></div><p>However, Cyclops was unable to face Sinister. When he was still a boy living at the orphanage, Mr. Sinister had planted mental blocks inside of Cyclops' mind. Therefore, he was unable to help while Sinister defeated the X-Men and X-Factor. With the stress of the situation mounting, Cyclops worked to overcome Sinister's mental blocks. With Marvel Girl's help, and Havok using his powers to overcharge him, Cyclops was finally able to use his optic blasts on Sinister. It was the first successful strike against Sinister, as he was unable to adapt to the blasts. Cyclops unleashed an extremely powerful attack, blasting Sinister's body to pieces. Though he had finally defeated his childhood tormentor, it would not be the last time Cyclops saw Sinister.</p><h3>Apocalypse and Askani</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2009361\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55309/2009361-cyclops_send_son_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops is forced to send his son into the future\"><img id=\"2009361\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55309/2009361-cyclops_send_son_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops is forced to send his son into the future\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops is forced to send his son into the future</div></div></div></div><p>Finally, Cyclops was surrounded by the family he always wanted. Together with Jean they cared for his son. They referred to the baby as Christopher rather than Nathan, as Cyclops' had always intended, and Jean thought of him as her own son. Later, when <a href=\"/nanny/29-7567/\">Nanny</a> and the <a href=\"/orphan-maker/29-25911/\">Orphan Maker</a> reappeared, Cyclops and Jean were able to defeat them and rescue Jean's brainwashed <a href=\"/gailyn-bailey/29-45191/\">niece</a> and <a href=\"/joey-bailey/29-45192/\">nephew</a>. When X-Factor went on a mission in <a href=\"/england/34-55794/\">England</a>, Jean packed baby supplies and insisted that they take baby Christopher with them. Not much later, their family life was ruined. <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a> returned, and part of his new scheme was to have baby Nathan Christopher infected with a <a href=\"/techno-organic/12-43631/\">techno-organic virus</a>.</p><p>Although Apocalypse was ultimately defeated, there was no cure for baby Nathan Christopher. Mysteriously, a strange woman appeared out of nowhere. The woman told Cyclops that her name was <a href=\"/askani/29-8302/\">Askani</a>, and that she had traveled from the distant future. She seemed to be infected with the same techno-organic virus as baby Nathan, and claimed that while there was no cure for it that there was a way to save the child. She offered to take the baby into the future where he would receive the necessary care to survive his infection, learn to live with it, and eventually become a savior to humankind. Cyclops was torn between keeping his son and watching him die, or allowing Askani to take him into the future where he may be saved. Ultimately, Cyclops made the decision to selflessly give Nathan to Askani. Immediately after taking baby Nathan, Askani disappeared into the future.</p><h3>Return to the X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"660033\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/660033-350px_xfactor60_super.jpg\" title=\"Brother vs. Brother\"><img id=\"660033\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/660033-350px_xfactor60_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Brother vs. Brother\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brother vs. Brother</div></div></div></div><p>After an adventure in space involving the <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> and X-Factor's ship, they returned to Earth. X-Factor teamed up with the X-Men to free <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> and members of the New Mutants from <a href=\"/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>. Cyclops was forced to fight his brother <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a> once again. Havok had been forced through the <a href=\"/siege-perilous/18-40957/\">Siege Perilous</a>, and been given a new life working as a <a href=\"/genoshan-magistrates/65-25418/\">Genoshan Magistrate</a>. Therefore, he didn't recognize his brother or any of his old allies. Although Cyclops managed to defeat his brother, all of the X-teams were taken captive by the Genoshans and had their powers removed. It was only due to the secret planning of the <a href=\"/genegineer-david-moreau/29-28470/\">Genegineer David Moreau</a> that Cyclops' power was restored when he came in contact with a de-aged Storm. The process also restored Storm to her original adult age.</p><p>Soon after, both X-Factor and the X-Men were forced to combat their former allies on <a href=\"/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a>, who had been possessed by the <a href=\"/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a>. The X-Men had been spread out across the globe, but after their many victories they had a larger roster of members than ever before. They decided to merge all of the teams, including X-Factor, and then split the X-Men into two strike teams. While Havok, <a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a>, and the other <a href=\"/muir-island-x-men/65-57847/\">Muir Island X-Men</a> became the new government sponsored X-Factor, the old X-Factor was assimilated into the new X-Men Blue and Gold teams. Storm led the Gold team, while Cyclops commanded the Blue team.</p><h3>X-Men Blue</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76390\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76390-43694-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Blue Team\"><img id=\"76390\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76390-43694-x-men_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Blue Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Blue Team</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops' Blue team was more aggressive than Storm's Gold team. Aside from <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> and <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, the team included members that Cyclops had either struggled to cooperate with in the past or had never worked with before. <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> and Cyclops rarely saw eye to eye due to Cyclops' leadership and their mutual attraction to Jean Grey. <a href=\"/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> was a natural loner, who often worked towards his own agenda. <a href=\"/jubilee/29-4562/\">Jubilee</a> was still very young, and relatively inexperienced in action. <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> had been through many life-changing experiences since Cyclops first met her, and the two soon became attracted to one another. Psylocke was open about her flirtation with Cyclops, who tried to deny his attraction to her.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/x-cutioners-song/39-42178/\">X-Cutioner's Song</a></b></h3><p>As they were enjoying a relaxing cup of coffee, <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean</a> caught Cyclops daydreaming about Psylocke. As he was reassuring her that it was nothing, they were ambushed by <a href=\"/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a> and kidnapped before any of the other X-Men could do anything to help. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/stryfe/29-7616/\">Stryfe</a> had disguised himself as <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a> and shot Professor Xavier with a techno-organic bullet at a peace rally in <a href=\"/central-park/34-57401/\">Central Park</a>. The X-Men divided their resources between working to save the Professor, tracking down Cable, and investigating the whereabouts of their missing friends. They captured <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a>, fought the <a href=\"/mutant-liberation-front/65-28349/\">Mutant Liberation Front</a>, <a href=\"/horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\">Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a>, and <a href=\"/dark-riders/65-41074/\">Dark Riders</a>, before teaming up with Apocalypse to uncover who had orchestrated several attacks at once.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"575716\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/575716-500705_img_0039_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops and Jean escaping from Stryfe\"><img id=\"575716\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/575716-500705_img_0039_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops and Jean escaping from Stryfe\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops and Jean escaping from Stryfe</div></div></div></div><p>It transpired that Cyclops and Jean Grey had been kidnapped by Stryfe. They struggled to break free from their cell and escape the high-tech base. They were recaptured and placed into solitary confinement where they were prodded by mechanical torture devices. On one of their attempts to escape they came across a baby who resembled Nathan Christopher when he was infected with the techno-organic virus. The baby was connected to the base's computers and wired to detonate. Sadly, Jean found out that the baby would die if they separated it from the machine. Stryfe was convinced that the two would kill the baby in order to save themselves, but Cyclops and Jean refused to harm the child. Confused, Stryfe removed the baby, and soon Cyclops and Jean managed to escape. However, when they got outside they found themselves trapped in a small pocket of air located on the surface of the moon.</p><p><a href=\"/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a>, Cable, and Wolverine tracked Stryfe down. However, Stryfe had created a force field that prevented anyone from entering, unless they had either Summers or Grey genetics. While the other X-Men waited outside of the force field, Cable and Havok continued onwards to stop Stryfe. When they reached Stryfe, his plans were finally revealed. Stryfe believed that he was Nathan Christopher Summers, and had been abandoned in the future where he was raised by cold and unloving machines. For this, he sought revenge on Scott and Jean, who he believed were his biological parents.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"575711\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/575711-500683_i054_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Cable... dead?\"><img id=\"575711\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/575711-500683_i054_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Cable... dead?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cable... dead?</div></div></div></div><p>However, Stryfe had been wrong. He was not Nathan, but instead a clone of the techno-organic infected baby. It was revealed that Cable was in fact Cyclops' son Nathan Christopher, back from the future. Stryfe opened a powerful vortex with the intent to kill everyone. Cable jumped into the vortex and began fighting against Stryfe. In the ensuing struggle between Cable and his clone, Stryfe was killed; but not before he managed to unleash the extremely deadly <a href=\"/legacy-virus/12-42281/\">Legacy Virus</a> into the Earth's atmosphere. Cable appeared to drag the destructive power of the vortex forwards through time, saving everyone. Cyclops had finally been reunited with his son, only to lose him to the future once again.</p><h3>Cyclops' Telepathic Women</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"85761\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/85761-122966-psylocke_super.jpg\" title=\"Psylocke kissing Cyclops\"><img id=\"85761\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/85761-122966-psylocke_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Psylocke kissing Cyclops\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Psylocke kissing Cyclops</div></div></div></div><p>Jean Grey confronted Psylocke about what sort of relationship she had with Cyclops. Psylocke admitted that she was sexually attracted to him, and attacked Jean. Although Jean was a more powerful telepath, she was not prepared for Psylocke's most powerful attack: her psychic knife. The fight was stopped by the appearance of a woman who claimed to be the <i>real</i> Psylocke. The woman resembled Psylocke's original British body, from before she entered the <a href=\"/siege-perilous/18-40957/\">Siege Perilous</a>. Even Wolverine's senses could not detect which woman was really Psylocke. The Blue team investigated the matter to uncover who was the real Psylocke, and made a startling discovery about the psychic ninja.</p><p>Psylocke had her mind swapped with an Asian assassin known as <a href=\"/revanche/29-9709/\">Kwannon</a>, who retained all of Psylocke's memories. Cyclops chose to accept Kwannon as an X-Man, and she was given the code name Revanche. After Psylocke had attacked Jean, Cyclops kept his distance from her and their attraction soon ended.</p><h3>Wedding Day and Honeymoon</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"581122\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/581122-untitled_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Wedding\"><img id=\"581122\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/581122-untitled_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Wedding\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Wedding</div></div></div></div><p>It had been years since the death of Madelyne Prior.

The date was set, the invitations went out, and Scott and Jean arranged for a priest to perform the ceremony at the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">mansion</a>. Storm used her powers to ensure that the weather would be suitably warm and bright for the wedding ceremony. Surrounded by their many friends and family, long-time lovers Scott Summers and Jean Grey were married. At long last, Jean Grey had finally become Jean Grey-Summers.</p><p>Unfortunately, the instant they left the safe confines of the mansion, Cyclops and Jean were snatched away. This time, they were dragged thousands of years into the future. They found themselves inhabiting bodies that had been created for their psychic consciousnesses, that could reproduce their own powers. They were finally reunited with the baby boy who they thought they would never see again. As Redd and Slym Dayspring, Jean and Cyclops were given the chance to raise Nathan Christoper Summers, otherwise known as <a href=\"/cable/29-2157/\">Askani'son</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"141970\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6179/141970-53779-cable_super.jpg\" title=\"Slym, Redd, &amp; Askani'son\"><img id=\"141970\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6179/141970-53779-cable_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Slym, Redd, &amp; Askani'son\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Slym, Redd, & Askani'son</div></div></div></div><p>Redd and Slym lived in the future with the Askani'son for twelve years. During that time they cared for him, helped educate him, and kept him safe from the clutches of <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a> and his forces. Askani'son had a clone who was created as a means to deceive and slow down Apocalypse. This clone, who would one day become Stryfe, was snatched away by Apocalypse and raised to become his heir. Apocalypse later tried to shift his life-force into the child's body, but as a result he realized that he was a clone and not the actual Askani'son. Apocalypse then rejected the boy. This led to the anger and resentment that caused Stryfe to later kidnap Scott and Jean. After twelve years had passed, and Askani'son had grown, Redd and Slym bid their son a tearful farewell. <a href=\"/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a> became the elderly woman known as \"Mother Askani\", and established the <a href=\"/clan-askani/65-45042/\">Askani</a> religion in order to help raise her half-brother.</p><p>Rachel summoned the power to send her biological parents back into the past, but as she did so she urged Jean to take on the name Phoenix. Cyclops and Phoenix were forced to leave their son once again, with their minds being returned back to their real bodies in the present day. They discovered themselves lying on a beach, dressed in strange uniforms. There, they had to aid an elderly woman. They encountered <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>, who informed Cyclops that he had another brother. Once they had successfully helped the old lady, they were free to enjoy the exotic island for the remainder of their honeymoon.</p><h3><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/operation-zero-tolerance/39-43899/\">Operation: Zero Tolerance</a></b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"686735\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/686735-cyclops14_super.jpg\" title=\"The bomb in Cyclops\"><img id=\"686735\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/686735-cyclops14_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The bomb in Cyclops\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The bomb in Cyclops</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops was taken prisoner as part of <a href=\"/operation-zero-tolerance/39-43899/\">Operation: Zero Tolerance</a>.

The X-Men continued operating from the <a href=\"/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">mansion</a>. Cyclops performed both administrative and liaison duties for the school, on top of leading the X-Men out in the field. However, Cyclops' behavior had noticeably changed. While on the way back from a mission in <a href=\"/australia/34-55838/\">Australia</a>, to retrieve the mutant <a href=\"/ugly-john/29-14079/\">Ugly John</a>, Wolverine and Cyclops encountered a new breed of <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a>.</p><p>The Sentinels were under the control of <a href=\"/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a>, Professor Xavier's evil twin sister.

Nova manages to disable Cyclops by feeding off his insecurities and telepathically placing his mind in a \"black bug room\" inhabited by giant talking cockroaches. Cyclops eventually snaps out of the illusion, and Nova is seemingly defeated by Xavier and Emma.

Cyclops began to feel neglected, and didn't feel like he could communicate with Jean. He sought the help of Emma Frost, and the two engaged in a series of psychic \"therapy sessions\" to help him get through his frustrations.</p><p>Emma took advantage of this situation in order to get closer to Cyclops. While in <a href=\"/hong-kong/34-55799/\">Hong Kong</a>, investigating mutant deaths caused by the <a href=\"/u-men/65-47994/\">U-Men</a>, Scott and Emma spent the night drinking champagne together. They started a telepathic affair, without any physical contact. The relationship was sexual in nature, appearing to revolve around Cyclops' varied fantasies about his wife. Although Emma was manipulating a confused Scott into continuing the affair, she eventually realized that she had fallen in love with him.</p><p>As it was telepathic in nature, Scott and Emma would often be in contact while in the company of others. Phoenix questioned Cyclops directly about what had happened in Hong Kong. His attitude and response were blunt, as he stated that Emma kept him up the entire night.

The girls led Phoenix into the mansion garden where Cyclops and Emma were telepathically engaged together. Phoenix entered Cyclops' mind without permission where she found Cyclops embracing Emma, who was dressed as the Dark Phoenix. Enraged, Phoenix telepathically attacked Emma without mercy. Angered at Jean for doing this, Cyclops demanded that she read his mind and look at the memories of the night he spent with Emma in Hong Kong. Phoenix saw that Cyclops had not been physically intimate with Emma, and that he told her he was serious about his celibacy and commitment to Jean.

Cyclops confesses to Wolverine his feelings about his marriage to Jean. He admits that he is attracted to Emma because she is more accepting than Jean, without judging him for wanting to try something different.

Cyclops was astounded, as he had liberated Xorn from the U-Men in Hong Kong and considered him to be a good friend. However, Xorn's strength had faltered and he had become reliant on the power-enhancing drug <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kick/12-42307/\">Kick</a>. It was later revealed that Xorn had been under the control of <a href=\"/sublime/29-11330/\">John Sublime</a>, and was merely using the guise of \"Magneto\" to gain followers. In a final confrontation with Xorn, Cyclops blasts his telepathy-blocking helmet to pieces in a moment of self-realization and rage.

With her dying words, she told Scott to live his life, as all she ever did was die on him. Once again, Scott Summers had lost Jean Grey. With his wife's death, a grieving and guilt-ridden Scott considers leaving the X-Men. He didn't know, however, that as Jean died the Phoenix showed her a vision of the future and the importance of his role in leading the X-Men.

This acts as a coping mechanism, giving Scott something to focus on and maintain control over at a time when events out of his control had effectively shattered the life he had led up to that point.</p><p>Surprisingly, Scott seemed to admit that this theory was the truth of the matter, further admitting that he had even blocked making the decision out of his memory to preserve the fallacy in his own mind and prevent others from discovering the truth. Scott apparently enters into a catatonic state, with his eyes uncovered and displaying their natural shade of brown, with no evidence of his powers manifesting. Later, Scott manifests his optic blasts when the X-Men are on Breakworld.

The students prove to be effective. Cyclops then confronts Cable, demanding he hand over the baby. Cable, with a gun pointed at his father, begs Cyclops to let him escape into the future with the baby so that she can make her own decisions instead of having them forced upon her. Cable gives the child to Cyclops, however, after Professor Xavier points out that the future of all mutant-kind is at stake and Cyclops, as leader of the X-Men, must speak for all of mutants.</p><p>Cyclops holds the baby and realizes that she deserves the chance to make her own destiny. Cyclops gives the girl back to Cable, telling him to raise her in the future away from those who would use her for their own agendas. Cable teleports to the future, just as Bishop fires at him. The shot misses and hits Professor X in the head, apparently killing him. Cyclops takes out Bishop with a blast and as the X-Men all gather around Xavier's body, Cyclops declares them disbanded. Xavier's body then disappears.</p><h3><a href=\"/divided-we-stand/39-52603/\">Divided We Stand</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"366618\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/366618-93550-emma-frost_super.jpg\" title=\"The Sixties\"><img id=\"366618\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/366618-93550-emma-frost_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The Sixties\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Sixties</div></div></div></div><p>It is later revealed that Cyclops didn't actually disband the X-Men, but rather made everyone take time off to recuperate themselves.

They spend time with <a href=\"/ka-zar/29-3558/\">Ka-Zar</a> and <a href=\"/shanna/29-4579/\">Shanna</a>, but are soon called back to <a href=\"/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a> by <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>. Once there, they see that all of San Francisco has been submerged in a psychic projection that resembles the 1960s. Emma uses her powers to help Cyclops and herself better blend in. They are successful in rescuing San Francisco from the source of the projection, a mutant calling herself the \"<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-mastermind/29-12055/\">Goddess</a>\". <a href=\"/sadie-sinclair/29-61892/\">Sadie Sinclair</a>, the mayor of San Francisco, offers to help the X-Men better establish themselves in the city.

After an assault on the Hellfire Cult's base, Cyclops is seemingly seduced by Emma, who appears to be wearing the exact same outfit as the Red Queen. When Scott mentions this to Emma at a <a href=\"/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a> concert she is confused. Scott then sees a familiar red-headed woman standing on the other side of the club. When Emma asks him what he saw, he cryptically tells her that he thinks his ex-wife Maddie may actually be alive. Cyclops then begins to behave more withdrawn and secretive. Emma begins to get worried, and also starts to notice odd behavior from both Wolverine and Archangel. When Emma decided she must confront Cyclops about this, he gives her permission to enter his mind.</p><p>Inside, she finds a black box, which she is unable to open. Cyclops claims within the box are all the plans and secrets that he, as the X-Men's leader, has developed to maintain their survival. Emma seems unconvinced, but lets the matter rest for the moment. <a href=\"/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a> arrives and informs Cyclops and Emma that the news has footage of the massacre that occurred during the events with the <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">mutant baby</a>, and that the baby's birth has been linked as the cause. As a result, a resurrected <a href=\"/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">Graydon Creed</a> and other previously dead foes begin pushing to outlaw mutant reproduction. The new anti-mutant propaganda causes an explosion of hate crimes on mutants and former mutants. Scott decides to open the doors of the X-Men's new base to all mutants that are in need of protection and sanctuary.</p><h3><a href=\"/utopia/39-55905/\">Utopia</a> and <a href=\"/dark-reign/39-55707/\">Dark Reign</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"790646\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/790646-7908new_storyimage1539091_full_super.jpg\" title=\"Utopia/Dark Reign\"><img id=\"790646\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/790646-7908new_storyimage1539091_full_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Utopia/Dark Reign\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Utopia/Dark Reign</div></div></div></div><p>Because of growing unrest among <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">mutants</a>, mass mutant riots begin to break out all over San Francisco. The <a href=\"/sadie-sinclair/29-61892/\">mayor</a> demands that the mutant \"leader\" Cyclops put a stop to all of this. Cyclops takes much, if not all, of the bad press. Emma appears to join <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a>'s <a href=\"/cabal/65-56051/\">Cabal</a>, and leads his <a href=\"/dark-x-men/65-56445/\">Dark X-Men</a>. Cyclops sees Emma on television leading the Dark X-Men as they stop a mutant riot. After this, he goes to speak with Osborn at his base on <a href=\"/alcatraz-island/34-57229/\">Alcatraz Island</a>. Osborn tells Cyclops he should surrender so as to put a stop to the mutant riots. Cyclops interrupts Osborn and tells him that he should surrender instead. Surprised, Norman asks Cyclops what he means. He tells Osborn that <a href=\"/hammer/65-56065/\">HAMMER</a> should leave San Francisco, and that the X-Men can handle mutant issues. Osborn refuses, and Cyclops departs after telling him that he tried being diplomatic. Angered, Norman vows to personally kill Cyclops.</p><p>It turns out Cyclops has had a master plan up his sleeve the entire time. He raises the remnants of <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Asteroid M</a> from the ocean, making a \"Utopia\" for all mutants. Emma returns to Cyclops' side along with <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> (who she has convinced to join the X-Men) having been working as a double-agent. At night, while in bed, Cyclops and Emma try to reassure each other that there will be no more secrets between them. This goes poorly at first, but the lovers eventually reconcile and share all their secrets with each other.</p><p>Osborn arrives on Utopia, attacking with the combined might of his <a href=\"/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/dark-x-men/65-56445/\">Dark X-Men</a>. Norman defeats Cyclops in personal combat, and appears ready to kill the mutant leader. However, this all turns out to be part of Cyclops' plan. News cameras swarm all over Osborn, as he soon realizes that his forces have been defeated by the X-Men thanks to Cyclops' superior strategy. Osborn is then forced to retreat, leaving Utopia.

Cyclops orders Charles to stand down, and later accepts Magneto as an X-Man.</p><p>Cyclops has Professor X telepathically link him with Emma's mind in an attempt to free her from the sliver of the <a href=\"/void/29-11585/\">Void</a> which remained inside her after she defeated the <a href=\"/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a>. Inside Emma's mind, Cyclops finds a white room filled with various diamond figures, each representing a different aspect of her psyche. Emma's main consciousness approaches Cyclops, but as they begin discussing how to extract the Void all of the other aspects of Emma attack. Realizing that the figures are not actually a part of Emma's mind, Cyclops attacks back by using a mental version of his optic blast. The blast acts as a beacon to Emma, who finds Cyclops again. However, the Void has plans of its own and moves to possess Cyclops.</p><p>Emma is ejected from the telepathic link and back into the physical world (now able to leave her diamond form), while Cyclops remains unconscious. Emma reveals that the Void has passed from her to Cyclops. Cyclops sits among the remains of the destroyed mansion, with a black mass hidden among the rubble. He is confronted by shadowy female figures who ask him why he didn't save them, and tell him he will never be the man he wants to be unless he lets the Void in. Emma appears on the scene and destroys the figures. She and Cyclops attempt to leave, but the Void grabs Cyclops and separates him from Emma.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"306621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/306621-182877-emma-frost_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops and Emma Frost\"><img id=\"306621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/306621-182877-emma-frost_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops and Emma Frost\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops and Emma Frost</div></div></div></div><p>In the physical world Scott screams in pain and Professor X tells <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> that if Cyclops wakes up before Emma, the Void has taken over him and Psylocke must kill him. In the meantime, the Void is still trying to convince Scott to let it take control. Scott responds by shooting it with his optic blast. He is then seen in a white room which Emma cannot enter. Since they are in Scott's mind, he is in control. He makes it so that Emma cannot enter the room, much to her dismay, and tells her to trust him.</p><p>The door of the room closes in front of Emma, who wakes up. Psylocke was about to kill Scott, but Emma tells her to give him a chance. Scott sits on the ground with a black box in front of him, and the Void starts to engulf him. He holds up the box, and suddenly the Void is trapped inside. Cyclops tells the Void that he had been in a relationship with an extremely powerful <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">telepath</a> for years, and she taught him how to defend his mind. Cyclops leaves the room with black box inside and closes the door. He repeats to himself that no one will ever open the door.

Cyclops is shown to have enormous faith in the fact that Hope will not only return, but that she will be the savior of the <a href=\"/mutant/12-40656/\">mutant</a> race. When he receives news that Cable and Hope may have returned, Cyclops sends his alpha team out while he coordinates their movements from Utopia. When <a href=\"/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> is outed, he gets some backlash from <a href=\"/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>. As time goes on, Cyclops' tactics are being tested as some of the X-Men begin to question his leadership.</p><p>With the X-Men suffering many injuries as well as two deaths (including Nightcrawler), Scott comes under fire with people questioning whether or not Hope is worth it.

They realize that <a href=\"/bastion/29-40568/\">Bastion</a> is trying to prevent them from leaving. Suddenly, a red dome encapsulates all of San Francisco. The X-Men discover the center of the dome on the Golden Gate bridge.</p><p>When the team arrives, they are shocked to find <a href=\"/nimrod/29-13314/\">Nimrods</a> exiting from the small sphere. It takes all of their efforts to destroy the Nimrods, with many injured. After regrouping, Cyclops leaves a team on the bridge in case more Nimrods come through. During a council meeting, <a href=\"/prodigy/29-40475/\">Prodigy</a> reveals he has calculated how many Nimrods are likely to come through the portal. He lost count at 170,000. Outside the dome, <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> from New York have gathered in an attempt to take down the dome from the outside.

Cable sacrifices himself, finally letting the <a href=\"/techno-organic/12-43631/\">techno-organic virus</a> take hold of his body. This allows him to hold the portal open while the rest of the team goes through. Cable dies with a smile on his face after seeing Hope one last time, his body seemingly exploding and leaving only his cybernetic left arm behind.</p><p>With no time to grieve for Cable's death, the X-Men defend themselves against Bastion as he attacks with the remainder of his forces. Hope, distraught at all that has happened, attacks Bastion and her true powers manifest. She proves to be an Omega-level mutant, capable of mimicking the powers of all mutants in her vicinity. Hope easily defeats Bastion with assistance from Cyclops, and <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> delivers the killing blow to avenge the death of Nightcrawler.

Ultimately, the Lord of Vampires decides that he will honor Cyclops, and allows the X-Men to take Jubilee with them. Although Blade and others are wary of the vampire Jubilee, Cyclops firmly believes there must be a way to rehabilitate the young former mutant.

He asks that the world leaders dismantle all sentinels in their nations to better improve relations with the mutant race. Just then, <a href=\"/kid-omega/29-40583/\">Quentin Quire</a> arrives to unleash a telepathic attack. Cyclops and Wolverine are left unaffected due to their psychic defenses, but the world leaders in the room begin shouting out embarrassing secrets about themselves on national television. After this, a battalion of Sentinels are unleashed with orders to track down and detain a male mutant. Fitting this basic description, Cyclops and Wolverine are attacked, but are able to easily defeat the sentinels.</p><p>Quentin addresses the world on television, relaying his ideology of mutant liberation against humanity. Later, the nations of the world begin to unleash their sentinels for fear of any more mutant attacks. Cyclops makes the call to place mutants on high alert, with <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> believing that they shouldn't cause panic. Cyclops stays pragmatic, stating that they must be cautious with so many people taking up arms against mutants. Wolverine becomes wary when Cyclops allows <a href=\"/oya/29-73388/\">Idie</a> to watch the newscast of the sentinels, but Cyclops feels that is is important for her to understand that the world hates and fears her for being born a mutant.</p><p>Later, Quentin arrives on Utopia seeking asylum. An enraged Wolverine demands that they hand Quentin over to <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Steve Rogers</a>. Cyclops insists that they should deal with Quire themselves, further angering Wolverine. Meanwhile, <a href=\"/kade-kilgore/29-78998/\">Kade Kilgore</a>, a psychotic child prodigy and billionaire, has been named the new \"Black King\" of the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>.

Cyclops watches from his command at Utopia, and Wolverine watches from a bar. Kade and his Hellfire team attack the museum, successfully incapacitating the entire team of X-Men utilizing their superior knowledge and technology.</p><p>Cyclops and Wolverine both race to the museum. Idie gets into telepathic contact with them to reveal that she has remained unnoticed and that the Hellfire terrorists have a bomb. Wolverine urges Cyclops to order Idie to escape, and that he can make it to the museum. Cyclops realizes neither he nor Wolverine will get there in time, and tells Idie do what she feels she must. Idie manages to defeat all the Hellfire soldiers and save the civilians before the bomb goes off. Cyclops and Wolverine arrive just in time to help the civilians to safety as the bomb explodes. Wolverine displays his anger to Cyclops for allowing Idie to take matters into her own hands, but Cyclops stands by his decision seeing that Idie saved all of the civilians.</p><p>They both soon realize, however, that the bomb the Hellfire Club left was an electromagnetic device that was using the metal in the area to create a new kind of gigantic sentinel. Cyclops escorts Idie back to Utopia while <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/29-24399/\">Madison Jeffries</a>, Dr. Nemesis, and Wolverine attempt to deal with the sentinel. Their efforts fail, however, and the sentinel makes its way towards Utopia. With most of the X-Men scattered around the globe, Cyclops is left alone to defend his nation. He realizes that this was all planned out, and blasts the sentinel. The sentinel keeps coming despite Cyclops' efforts, and he alerts everyone on Utopia to brace themselves for an attack.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1860821\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1860821-xmenschism004_cov_col.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops vs. Wolverine\"><img id=\"1860821\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1860821-xmenschism004_cov_col_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops vs. Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops vs. Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope</a> comes to assist Cyclops, accompanied by her <a href=\"/five-lights/65-57893/\">Five Lights</a> and some of the <a href=\"/young-x-men/65-51146/\">Young X-Men</a>. Cyclops rallies them together to fight the approaching sentinel, but Wolverine arrives and demands that they all be sent away due to their ages. Cyclops believes that, despite their youth, they are still capable of defending Utopia. Wolverine continues to argue with Cyclops, insisting that Utopia be evacuated instead. Hope and the others choose to remain and fight alongside Cyclops. This prompts Wolverine to arm 2000 pounds of plastic explosives, from his personal stash, in an attempt to force an evacuation and destroy the sentinel.</p><p>The young mutants rush to alert everyone, while Cyclops stays behind to face Wolverine. The two X-Men argue about detonating the bombs, with both refusing to back down. Ultimately, this leads to a brutal fight over the remote to the explosives. All the while, the sentinel looms overhead trying to kill them both. The fight is broken up when Hope and the other students start fighting the sentinel. Cyclops and Wolverine put their differences aside and help defeat the sentinel. While Utopia is recovering from the attack, Wolverine reveals to Cyclops that he plans to leave Utopia, along with any X-Men that will come with him.</p><p>Although he believes that Wolverine is making a mistake, Cyclops allows him to leave.

Awaking to find himself trapped in a strange tube underground, Cyclops is greeted by his fellow prisoners who consist of X-Men from various alternate dimensions. The Storm he met was from the dimension they are being held in, a world that is powered by draining the abilities of mutants.

The goal he sets for them is to prove that they are \"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\", changing public perception of mutants into something the world needs to survive. They will also act as a deterrent against attacks on mutants (including those at Wolverine's <a href=\"/jean-grey-school-for-higher-learning/34-57624/\">new school</a>).

Cyclops orders the team to depart for Wakanda, displeasing Emma.</p><p>When they arrive Namor is defeated by the power of the Scarlet Witch, and his share of the Phoenix Force leaves him and is then split amongst the remaining avatars. <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Xavier</a> telepathically speaks with Scott, upset over what has happened.

Emma is concerned about the Phoenix's power corrupting her, and states that part of her wishes to end the conflict with the Avengers by simply switching off their minds. Scott is worried that she is sounding like Namor, and that the Avengers are trying to paint them as villains. Emma reveals to him that she has reached into every mind on the planet, and has found Hope in the mystical city of <a href=\"/kun-lun/34-56104/\">K'un-Lun</a>.

This universe is the source of the beam's exotic energy. Cyclops constantly absorbs ambient energy (such as sunlight) into the cells of his body, metabolizing the energy in order to open the interdimensional apertures.</p><p>Cyclops' mind generates a psionic field that is attuned to the same forces that maintain the apertures. This field envelops his body, thus protecting him from the energy of his optic blasts. Even the thin membranes of Cyclops' eyelids are sufficient to block the emission of energy, allowing him to shut off his power by simply closing his eyes. The synthetic <a href=\"/ruby-quartz/18-55652/\">ruby quartz</a> crystals used to fashion the lenses of Cyclops' sunglasses and visor are resonant to his minds' psionic field and are similarly protected. The width of Cyclops' optic blast is focused by his mind's psionic field. As Cyclops focuses the apertures in his eyes are altered to control the flow of energy and the relative power of the blast, which is filtered through his visor.</p><p>The maximum force of Cyclops' blasts is unknown, but a commonly given description is that they can \"punch holes through mountains\" and he has been shown rupturing steel plate and pulverizing solid rock. During one particular battle Cyclops says that he hit <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> with enough power to split a small planet in half, though he may have been indulging in hyperbole. It has been stated that Cyclops uses only a fraction of his potential energy output. His more powerful blasts can demolish fully-armored tanks and destroy <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>.</p><p>Due to psychological trauma and a head injury, Cyclops is unable to shut off his optic blasts and must therefore wear ruby quartz lenses at all times to block the beams. <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> revealed that the trauma of losing his family, and anxiety of hurting someone with his power, are primarily responsible for his lack of control. <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> has claimed that Cyclops' eyes have become reliant on ruby quartz, making it harder for him to control the blasts on his own. After overcoming his past trauma, with some \"help\" from Emma, Cyclops gained control of his power for a period of time. However, he gradually began losing control and had to revert back to using his glasses and visor.</p><p>Just as Cyclops is resistant to the effects of his own power, he is resistant to his brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a>'s power as a result of their familial genetic coding. Likewise, Havok is resistant to Cyclops' power. Both have only a limited resistance to their brother <a href=\"/vulcan/29-21233/\">Vulcan</a>'s powers.</p><h4>Spatial Awareness</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"780530\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/780530-the_uncanny_x_men_124___10_super.jpg\" title=\"Ricochet Blast\"><img id=\"780530\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/780530-the_uncanny_x_men_124___10_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ricochet Blast\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ricochet Blast</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops possesses an uncanny sense of spacial geometry, enhancing his observation of objects around him and the angles found between these objects. This grants Cyclops a high degree of skill and accuracy in manipulating his optic blasts. Cyclops has frequently demonstrated the ability to cause his optic blasts to ricochet and/or reflect off objects in a trajectory to his liking. He has been observed reflecting beams off of a dozen different surfaces in the course of one blast and still hit his target accurately. It is his enhanced spatial awareness and the use of his battle visor that allows him to perform these feats.</p><h3><u>Abilities</u></h3><h4>Master Tactician and Strategist</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1028991\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1028991-76_new_mutants_10_super.jpg\" title=\"Mutant Strategist\"><img id=\"1028991\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1028991-76_new_mutants_10_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mutant Strategist\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mutant Strategist</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops has spent the majority of his superhero career as leader of either the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> or <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a>, and has developed exceptional leadership skills. According to <a href=\"/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>, Cyclops' leadership skills are at their best in tense situations. Fury notes that the less time Cyclops has to think about a decision, the better it tends to be. <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Xavier</a> entrusted Cyclops with the responsibility of leading the X-Men, seeing in him a combination of analytical intelligence and tactical brilliance that would eventually help to make him an exceptional combat strategist. It is notable that regardless of their general attitude towards him, the majority of the X-Men tend to obey Cyclops' orders in battle - because they know that he's usually right. Cyclops has been known to incorporate the tactics and fighting styles of his teammates into his own self-defense system, calculating the most successful features of their styles and adapting them for his own use.</p><h4>Master Combatant</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"780523\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/780523-0004abzr.jpg\" title=\"Combat Expertise\"><img id=\"780523\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/780523-0004abzr_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Combat Expertise\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Combat Expertise</div></div></div></div><p>As an X-Man, Cyclops has undergone intensive physical and mental training since his early teenage years. He is a skilled athlete and <a href=\"/martial-artists/12-55802/\">martial artist</a> with extensive training in hand-to-hand combat, holding black belts in judo and aikido. His combat prowess is sufficient to defeat a group of six attackers with his eyes closed, and he has held his own against such exceptionally skilled fighters as <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> and <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>. On more than one occasion, Cyclops has proven his skill by besting the X-Men as a team in battle.</p><h4>Telepathic Resistance</h4><p>Thanks to training from Professor Xavier, and due in part to his own emotional stoicism, Cyclops has developed a degree of resistance to psychic probing and manipulation. He is virtually immune to casual scans, and possesses an awareness that makes him difficult to read even for the psychics closest to him, notably Xavier and Emma Frost.</p><h4>Expert Pilot</h4><p>Cyclops is a talented pilot of fixed-wing aircraft, a skill that he appears to have inherited from his <a href=\"/corsair/29-7591/\">father</a>. It has been implied that Cyclops' intuitive geometric sense improves his abilities in the air. He has long been the primary pilot the X-Men's jet, the <a href=\"/blackbird/18-41920/\">Blackbird</a>.</p><h3><u>Paraphernalia</u></h3><h4>Ruby Quartz Visor</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"714079\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31499/714079-cyclops_00.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops' Visor\"><img id=\"714079\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31499/714079-cyclops_00_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops' Visor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops' Visor</div></div></div></div><p>Aside from the usual alien technology that is at the X-Men's disposal, Cyclops has one essential piece of equipment that he can never be without: his <a href=\"/ruby-quartz/18-55652/\">ruby quartz</a> visor. Ever since his teenage years he has had to wear sunglasses with synthetic ruby quartz lenses. At the time, it made him a target for bullies and made him feel weak and exposed. If the glasses slipped or if they were knocked off by a fall, then Cyclops could accidentally destroy everything within sight. The introduction of the battle visor revolutionized Cyclops' life. Securely fastened to his head, Cyclops could easily open and close the visor's slit to filter out the amount of energy he required. Although Cyclops has never mastered his own mutant power, he has successfully mastered the use of his visor. It has become a distinctive icon for his appearance.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3><b><a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a> (Earth-295)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"706879\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/706879-tftaoa_sb_p00_super.jpg\" title=\"Age of Apocalypse Cyclops\"><img id=\"706879\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8582/706879-tftaoa_sb_p00_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Age of Apocalypse Cyclops\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Age of Apocalypse Cyclops</div></div></div></div><p>When Scott Summers was still a child, his <a href=\"/corsair/29-7591/\">father</a> was flying the family to <a href=\"/canada/34-55868/\">Canada</a> when their plane was attacked by a <a href=\"/shiar/65-55854/\">Shi'ar</a> spacecraft. Giving him the only parachute on board, Scott's father threw him and his younger brother <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Alex</a> out of the aircraft and into the Canadian wilderness. The brothers were taken to an orphanage run by <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a>, who later adopted the two and considered them the closest thing he had found to genetic perfection. Scott quickly became Sinister's favorite, due to his strong genetics and ability to lead. This favoritism would strain the relationship between Scott and Alex, who grew jealous of his older brother. Unknown to both Scott or Alex, their real father had managed to escape from the Shi'ar and made his way back to Earth in a Shi'ar airship. Unfortunately, he was also infected with a <a href=\"/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a> egg and his ship was captured by <a href=\"/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>'s forces. He was taken to the breeding pens, where he was experimented on by <a href=\"/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Henry McCoy</a> for a number of years.</p><p>Cyclops began to question the treatment of the prisoners in the breeding pens, and soon began to secretly release them. <a href=\"/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> was captured by Cyclops during a mission with the X-Men and sent to Sinister's lab. However, Cyclops became attracted to Jean for her spirit and dedication. He contemplated returning Jean to her friends but <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Weapon X</a> had infiltrated the labs and freed Jean himself, encountering Cyclops along the way. The two fought in a ferocious battle with, Weapon X taking out Cyclops's left eye while Cyclops in turn blasted off Weapon X's left hand. Both Jean and Weapon X managed to escape, but a bitter resentment remained between Cyclops and Weapon X.</p><p>After five years of being experimented on, Christopher Summers managed to escape from the breeding pens, much to Sinister's chagrin. He ordered his recapture but told Alex and Scott to remain behind, which made Scott suspicious of the nature of this mission. After the search team's emergency beacon was picked up, Cyclops and Havok went to investigate in the Ghost Lands. There, they encountered their long lost father. Christopher told them the story of how they became separated, which was enough to convince Havok that he was telling the truth. Cyclops, however, wasn't so easily swayed.</p><p>During a battle between some scavengers, Sinister came and rescued the Summers family. Unfortunately, the Brood egg that was inside of Christopher hatched and he proceeded to attack Sinister. Before he could cause any further harm, Christopher's consciousness became dominant and he begged Scott to kill him. Scott reluctantly complied and killed his father. This act caused a further rift between Scott and Alex, who now blamed him for the death of their father.</p><p>Cyclops soon learned that Apocalypse's Horseman, Death, was trying to cause a mutiny and seize power for himself. Cyclops knew he had to make a stand and helped <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blink/29-12548/\">Blink</a> free her captured teammates and release <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a> from his prison. Blink teleported Cyclops and her teammates to safety as Sunfire incinerated Death. It was around this time that Sinister had created <a href=\"/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a> using both Scott and Jean as genetic templates, who were both unaware of this development. Sinister planned to use X-Man to overthrow Apocalypse as ruler.</p><p>On one occasion, Cyclops came into contact with X-Man and tried to help him escape from the pens. However, the rash mutant refused his help and escaped the pens by himself. Both were unaware of their relationship to each other or that they were secretly being watched by Sinister himself. Cyclops also became increasingly concerned by Sinister's sudden disappearances. He broke into Sinister's lab and discovered the place had been trashed. Cyclops realized that Sinister had abandoned them and betrayed Apocalypse.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"204173\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204173-32475-cyclops_super.jpg\" title=\"Prelate Summers\"><img id=\"204173\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/204173-32475-cyclops_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Prelate Summers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Prelate Summers</div></div></div></div><p>Cyclops continued to rescue people from the breeding pens. Unfortunately, people began to suspect that something was amiss. They questioned a young mutant named <a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">Lorna Dane</a>, who witnessed the previous nights escape. Unfortunately, Lorna had a fragile mind and thought she had witnessed Magneto rescuing the prisoners. Havok ordered that she be interrogated by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a>, but Cyclops stopped the torture and ordered her release back to the pens. That night, Cyclops broke into the pens, while in disguise, and rescued Lorna. However, his activities were detected by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aurora/29-3189/\">Aurora</a>. With his face hidden in the darkness, Cyclops attacked the twins and made his getaway. Meeting with a member of the underground at the Hudson River, Cyclops turned Lorna over to them. However, his face was no longer in disguise and his activities were being monitored by Havok from a distance.</p><p>Jean returned to Sinister's lab in an attempt to locate him, but she was captured by Havok and sent to the Beast. Cyclops was stunned to see Jean again and when he refused Havok's order to kill her, Havok revealed that he knew Cyclops had been helping the prisoners escape from the pens. Cyclops was then captured and, along with Jean, tortured by the Beast. However, Jean used her psychic powers to remove Cyclops' visor and he released a concussive blast on the Beast, rendering him unconscious.</p><p>Cyclops and Jean escaped and tried to free the prisoners in the breeding pens. However, Apocalypse had ordered that all of the prisoners be killed as a means to convey his message of survival of the fittest. Cyclops and Jean met with X-Man, who had come to bring an end to Apocalypse's rule. X-Man discovered that the two were his parents, while Jean and Scott both felt a strange connection to the boy. Scott and Jean then made their way to the Brain Trust, which had anesthetized the prisoners so that they lacked the will to escape.</p><p>Jean used her psychic powers to destroy the Brain Trust as Cyclops ordered the <a href=\"/jesse-bedlam/29-15329/\">Bedlam Brothers</a>, who had also betrayed Apocalypse's rule, to disable the main generators and knock out all of the lights. As the prisoners escaped, Cyclops and Jean fought Havok. Cyclops managed to knock Havok unconscious, but could not bring himself to kill his brother. Cyclops and Jean then led the prisoners to safety, but Jean sensed that the Human High Council had unleashed bombs that were making their way towards Apocalypse's America.</p><p>In an attempt to hold the bombs back, Jean blanketed the sky with a telekinetic shield. Havok had managed to track down Cyclops and Jean, and proceeded to slay Jean with his powers. Cyclops confronted his brother, but was defeated and nearly killed as well. As Havok gloated over the defeat of his brother, Weapon X killed him to avenge the death of his beloved.</p><p>Weapon Omega has ascended as new ruler of Age of Apocalypse. Cyclops reappears as head minister of Famine\u00b4s control, under the control of Weapon Omega.

He dated <a href=\"/polaris/29-1473/\">Lorna Dane</a>, a mutant who possessed magnetic powers, until she left him for his older brother <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Alex</a>. Later, Scott was rescued from a lynch mob by the mutant telepath <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a>, who recruited him to be the first X-Man. He took the code name \"Cyclops\". Cyclops was outfitted with a dark blue and gold uniform standard to the initial <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> of Earth 1610. The suit, composed of high-tech latex and Kevlar, also acted as a cloaking device that disguised his mutant bio-signature from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>. He could release an optic blast either by pressing on a button on either side of his visor, or by pressing a concealed button in the palm of his gloves. Scott became considerably infatuated with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a>, codenamed \"Marvel Girl\", another prodigy of Professor Xavier.</p><p>Prior to the X-Men's first mission it took Scott an entire year and a half to develop the courage to ask Jean out to go see a movie with him, according to Jean. Though shy and timid when it came to the subject of Jean Grey, Cyclops acted as the team's field leader, at first to the chagrin of newly recruited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> who cited Cyclops' age as he was a year younger than him. Cyclops' first recorded mission with the X-Men was the rescue and eventual recruitment of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Robert Drake</a>, soon to be codenamed \"Iceman\". His second was the rescue of the deadly mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, who also joined the X-Men, albeit initially as a means to assassinate Professor X for <a href=\"/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>.</p><p>It would only take a short time for Cyclops to develop a tumultuous relationship with Wolverine, as Wolverine found himself very attracted to Jean Grey. After the X-Men's third mission, the rescue of the U.S. President's kidnapped daughter from the <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil</a>, Cyclops became disillusioned with the X-Men's goals. This was allegedly because of Xavier's dealings with an anti-mutant U.S. administration, but also because he had witnessed a mutual kiss between Marvel Girl and Wolverine.</p><p>Cyclops then took the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blackbird/18-41920/\">Blackbird</a>, abandoned the X-Men, and joined the <a href=\"/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>. He participated in their bombings of Parliament and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mi6/65-53504/\">MI6</a> building. When Magneto lead an army of Sentinels to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/washington-dc/34-55685/\">Washington</a> in retaliation for a government sponsored attack on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>, Cyclops quit the Brotherhood of Mutants and alerted the X-Men. He even convinced Magneto's son <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> to play a role in defeating his father. Cyclops would return to the X-Men and lead them in many more missions, including bouts with Sentinels, a hunt for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Sinister</a>, and a rescue mission for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>.</p><p>When teammate Colossus quit and returned to <a>Russia</a>, Cyclops and Marvel Girl followed and convinced him to rejoin. During this period, Cyclops and Jean grew closer and soon after became a couple. Though his relationship with Jean had already ended, a jealous Wolverine fought with Scott. Professor Xavier tried to force the two to cooperate, sending them on a mission together to the Savage Land in order to find missing U.S. marines. There they faced a sentient computer and its army of cyborg zombies. While fleeing a collapsing underground complex, Wolverine chose to let Cyclops fall into a chasm.</p><p>Cyclops survived the fall, albeit severely injured, and clung to life by eating grubs and worms to survive. After twenty-six days he was found by Brotherhood members, who failed to recognize him, and took him back to their new base for medical treatment. When Magneto plotted to reverse Earth's magnetic fields, Cyclops summoned the X-Men in time to stop him. Cyclops confronted Wolverine, and violently removed him from the team after blasting him to the ground.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"961856\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51622/961856-cyc_super.jpg\" title=\"Cyclops is assassinated by Quicksilver\"><img id=\"961856\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51622/961856-cyc_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclops is assassinated by Quicksilver\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyclops is assassinated by Quicksilver</div></div></div></div><p>Months later, Cyclops invited Wolverine back, feeling it was his best chance to rehabilitate.

His body was held by <a href=\"../../ord/29-4445/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ord</a>. Ord explained that Colossus was only dead by \"human\" standards, and he had discovered that it was a mutant from Earth who would end up destroying his world. His goal was to experiment on Colossus's body. He revived him and, after discovering the Legacy Virus in his body, cured him. It was Kitty who found him later and freed Colossus from a secret chamber miles deep underground. Colossus' initial rage was calmed upon recognizing Kitty, and he returned to the X-Men. Returning to life at the mansion, Kitty and Colossus were initially wary of each other. They didn't want to move too quickly for fear of upsetting the other. However, they finally overcame their worries and entered into a sexual relationship.</p><p>Despite having been attracted to each other since their young teenage years, it was the first time they had consummated their relationship. Unfortunately they soon ran into problems. After a fight with <a href=\"../../danger/29-40862/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danger</a>, <a href=\"../../cassandra-nova/29-11317/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cassandra Nova</a> used <a href=\"../../emma-frost/29-1457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emma</a> to launch a psychic attack against the X-Men. Colossus believed that he had been in battle with <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a>. Colossus was quickly defeated, but was later awoken by the precognitive student, <a href=\"../../blindfold/29-40597/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blindfold</a>. He was taken the basement where he saw <a href=\"../../cyclops/29-1459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cyclops</a> shoot the psychic illusions created by Emma Frost's telepathic mind. Nova used Emma's powers to confuse Kitty with illusions. In her mind, Kitty and Colossus had a baby son named Michael.</p><p>However, the X-Men and Colossus took the baby away from Kitty. Although it felt she had lived for years, the illusion was barely two minutes long. Kitty was released from the illusion but continued to believe that Colossus was hiding her baby. Incredibly angry, she threatened to phase an axe into Colossus' head until he revealed where their 'son' was. However, it was all part of Nova's plan by to use Kitty's powers to retrieve her <a href=\"/body/49-29273/\">body</a> from an impenetrable cage in the basement. It was then revealed that Colossus was the X-Man destined to destroy the <a href=\"../../breakworld/34-42278/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breakworld</a>.</p><h3><a href=\"../../breakworld/34-42278/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Breakworld</a></h3><p>When Nova was defeated, <a href=\"../../sword/65-41666/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SWORD</a> teleported the X-Men onto their ship and took them to the Breakworld. They were told that they needed to stop the Breakworld from firing a missile at Earth. Upon their arrival on Breakworld, the X-Men were divided. Kitty remained with Colossus, and they were given a room for the night. Despite the traumatic experience of Nova's delusional life, Kitty set aside her anger and used the opportunity to spend quality time with Colossus. It was the the first and last time they were able to sleep together. Cyclops set his final mission plan into action. Cyclops, Emma and Colossus made their way to the core of the Breakworld as a distraction and as a fail-safe. If Kitty, Beast and <a href=\"../../abigail-brand/29-4441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Agent Brand</a> failed, he was to rip out the planet's core. While battling inside the core, Colossus was then informed that <a href=\"../../aghanne/29-50439/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aghanne</a> was behind the false prophecy that he would destroy the planet.</p><p>Unfortunately, Kitty phased into the 'missile' to discover that there was no circuitry or machinery inside it. She was too exhausted to phase free, and was therefore trapped inside a planet sized bullet. Although Kitty was able to phase the bullet through the Earth, she was lost in action.</p><h3><a href=\"../../decimation-house-of-m-the-day-after/49-18132/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day</a></h3><p>Colossus was part of the team that tracked the Marauders and tried to find the first <a href=\"../../hope-summers/29-49329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mutant baby</a> since <a href=\"../../m-day/12-41003/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day</a>. He then took part in the final battle on Muir Island. After the X-Men disbanded Colossus journeyed to Europe with Nightcrawler and Wolverine. After a stop in <a href=\"/germany/34-55777/\">Germany</a>, the guys arrives in Russia where Colossus placed flowers on his parents grave. They talked about how he lost the love of his life (Kitty), but were soon captured by the Red Room while trying to leave Russia.</p><p>Their captors were trying to establish why was all their mutant agents have been depowered while Colossus had retained his powers. Soon a battle broke out between the X-Men and the Russian government with <a href=\"../../omega-red/29-9729/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Omega Red</a>. The X-Men were triumphant and immediately afterward received a call from Cyclops informing them of the X-Men's new base in <a href=\"/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a>. While in a <a href=\"../../sentinels/65-4296/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinel</a> art gallery, Colossus was forced to fight Magneto. It appeared that his powers had somehow been restored, but it was a new costume provided by the <a href=\"../../high-evolutionary/29-13346/\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Evolutionary</a> that replicated his original powers. Colossus repeatedly approached Cyclops to continue his search for Kitty, and grew frustrated and withdrawn at the loss of his lover. The X-Men and <a href=\"/new-x-men/65-57198/\">New X-Men</a> tried in vain to cheer him up with trivial distractions. Ultimately, Colossus began to cope with his loss when a little girl asked him to 'save kitty', referring to her little cat who had become stuck up a tree. Colossus later helped <a href=\"../../cannonball/29-1496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball</a> and <a href=\"../../armor/29-4442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Armor</a> fight against the invading <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrulls</a> in San Francisco.</p><h3><a href=\"../../second-coming/39-55971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Second Coming</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1096600\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1096600-118_uncanny_x_men_523_finch_variant__super.jpg\" title=\"Second Coming\"><img id=\"1096600\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1096600-118_uncanny_x_men_523_finch_variant__thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Second Coming\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Second Coming</div></div></div></div><p>Colossus is part of the team sent out by Cyclops to find <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cable</a> and <a href=\"../../hope-summers/29-49329/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hope</a>.

Once back on <a href=\"../../utopia/34-56536/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utopia</a>, and after the death of Nightcrawler Colossus demands that Cyclops somehow rescue his sister. This is when Cyclops announces that he is sending a team in Limbo to retrieve Illyana, as she is the last teleporter left on Utopia (Bastion's forces had managed to kill Nightcrawler, <a href=\"../../vanisher/29-6756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vanisher</a> and <a href=\"../../ariel/29-41840/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ariel</a>) besides <a href=\"../../pixie/29-40673/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pixie</a>. Colossus demands to be taken along, but Cyclops explains that his strength is needed to defend Utopia.</p><p>Pixie initially refuses to return to Limbo and Colossus becomes enraged. Pixie's feelings are hurt by his outrage and she runs away to hide on the island. <a href=\"/anole/29-40458/\">Anole</a> eventually convinces Pixie to go to Limbo and she teleports the team ( <a href=\"/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, Anole, <a href=\"/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a>, <a href=\"/dazzler/29-1498/\">Dazzler</a>, <a href=\"/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a>, <a href=\"/trance/29-40885/\">Trance</a> and Pixie) into Limbo.</p><p>Colossus is seen again when he engages in the fight to defend Utopia from the first round of <a href=\"/nimrod/29-13314/\">Nimrod</a> Sentinels. The X-Men suffer large losses during this fight with almost every member hurt badly, including <a href=\"/hellion/29-40454/\">Hellion</a> losing his hands.

As more Nimrods emerge from the portal the team is quickly overwhelmed. The Nimrods manage to compensate for Colossus' immense strength, and one of the Nimrods breaks his arm. Colossus is almost killed by the Nimrods until they sense the arrival of a larger threat. The appearance of <a href=\"/legion/29-13349/\">Legion</a>, an Omega level mutant, and a much greater threat, saves Colossus' life.</p><h3><a href=\"/nation-x/39-55961/\">Nation X</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1170148\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1170148-bullet008_super.jpg\" title=\"Untouchable Kitty\"><img id=\"1170148\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/57606/1170148-bullet008_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Untouchable Kitty\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Untouchable Kitty</div></div></div></div><p>The X-Men try to settle into their new island nation with old enemies. One of which is Magneto. Magneto is not welcomed greatly. In an effort to gain some credibility Magneto takes of to a high point in San Francisco to which he begins meditating and using his powers so greatly to bring Kitty Pride back to Earth. He uses his ability to bring the bullet she disappeared on back and he breaks the bullet down releasing Kitty. Only for Colossus and everyone too find out Kitty cannot turn solid. For the next several days the only way Colossus and Kitty can communicate is through Emma using her telepathy.</p><h3><a href=\"/curse-of-the-mutants/39-56136/\">Curse of the Mutants</a></h3><p>Not too soon after the events of Second Coming, the X-Men have to deal with a threat of a <a href=\"/vampires/12-55796/\">vampire</a> invasion. Colossus and Wolverine are sent on a mission to San Francisco to bring back a live vampire for the <a href=\"/x-club/65-56306/\">X-Club</a> to study. During the mission the vampire gets away, and then is attacked by Storm, causing it to flee to the sewers. Colossus and Wolverine go after it and are met by <a href=\"/blade/29-7570/\">Blade</a> who kills the vampire. The Vampire invasion soon hits San Francisco hard. The X-Men are split in pairs and sent to protect human kind. Colossus is paired up with Pixie. When the invasion escalates and the vampires descend on Utopia Cyclops is ready. He has a majority of the mutants in lock down while he kept a team above ground call \"Tough Skin\", which consisted of all mutants who couldn't be bitten like Dust, Magma, <a href=\"about://bling/29-40669/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bling!,</a> Mercury, Rockslide, <a href=\"about://armor/29-4442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Armor</a>, <a href=\"about://husk/29-3426/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Husk</a>, and Emma Frost.</p><p>When the attack starts, Wolverine, who had been turned into a vampire, attacks Colossus and quickly takes him down.

A team goes up in space to meet Brand. She informs them that since Colossus tore their leader's arm off that made him their leader, and since he wouldn't stay and they wouldn't let S.W.O.R.D be in charge Breakworld went into shambles. And there is a rebel ship in the sector. Brand takes the X-Men over to the ship to find Krunn with some of his people. He tells them they are there to seek asylum from Powerlord Colossus. Cyclops allows the Breakworld people asylum on Utopia. Everyone returns to the island. After a while Krunn gets some pieces of the bullet Kitty was on, from Magneto, he then uses some of the X-Clubs labs to create a serum that depowers mutants. He attacks and uses this serum on Magneto and <a href=\"/madison-jeffries/29-24399/\">Madison Jeffries</a>. Krunn then attacked Kitty and Colossus. He used the serum on Colossus so he couldn't change.</p><p>He stabs Colossus with a knife made from the same material as the bullet fired at Earth. Kitty got away and then her throat was slit by Krunn's partner, <a href=\"/haleena/29-77588/\">Haleena</a>, who also had a knife made from the bullet, these magical knives were able to cut the intangible Kitty.

Madison Jeffries and <a href=\"/dr-nemesis/29-29924/\">Dr. Nemesis</a> placed restraints on her that would shock her if teleportation distortions were detected. A bomb was set to explode if she made it to limbo, and worse if it detected a magic surge. This made Piotr very angry and he had a huge argument with Cyclops. Colossus occasionally visited his sister.</p><p>Juggernaut is soon granted tremendous power by the Asgardian Serpent, and he is heading toward San Francisco. The X-Men engage him. Kitty phases Pete to appear behind Juggernaut, but Juggernaut just throws Colossus off to the side, and he is saved by Iceman. Colossus again engages him and once again Juggernaut tosses Colossus to the side like a rag doll. Soon Cyclops gets some info on the thing that has taken over Juggernaut. He takes it to his only expert on mystics, Magik. With Colossus and Kitty by his side, Cyclops goes to as Magik for help.</p><p>She tells them that she'll need some freedom. Cyclops lets Magik free but with a fail-safe attached. Magik teleports Colossus and Kitty to The Crimson Cosmos, where they meet <a href=\"/cyttorak/29-24949/\">Cyttorak</a>. Magik explains to him that Juggernaut, his avatar, is serving another. With this new info, Magik also tells him he will need a new avatar. He agrees with her, and as she starts to step forward Colossus stops her and steps forward in her place. Kitty tries to stop him, but it is too late. He touches the crystal and becomes the new Juggernaut. Colossus is immediately teleported in front of Cain Marko and the two lock fists in combat. As the battle ensues, Colossus discovers that, even with his added power from Cyttorak, Cain is still more powerful than he is due to the added powers of the Serpent. However, Colossus also realizes that he doesn't want to stop and forces Marko back to his beginning point of his rampage in the country. Emma Frost soon discovers that that due to the two powers of the Crimson Gem of Cyttorak, both Marko and Piotr's energies will soon engulf them both, not only killing them, but creating an explosion equal to a nuclear bomb going off. However, Colossus continues to pour into Marko to the point he knocks his helmet clear off and starts to beat him to death. The Serpent, realizing he could lose another of his fear avatars, teleports Marko back to his castle and ends the conflict. Colossus soon returns to his normal mutant form, but he is now larger and is missing his hair. While the day was saved and the Juggernaut was stopped, Kitty Pryde can no longer be with Piotr as he chose to once again not put her first in his life. The two soon depart and Colossus informs his sister, Magik, that the power inside him makes him want to destroy.</p><h3><a href=\"../../schism/39-56404/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Schism</a></h3><p>Colossus joins Emma Frost, Iceman, Namor and Magneto at the opening of the <a href=\"/museum-of-mutant-history/34-57636/\">Museum of Mutant History</a>, even while half the worlds old Sentinels were being turned back on to attack mutants.

Cyclops calls back to Utopia and tells the doctors to prepare for the injured X-Men.</p><h3><a href=\"/regenesis/39-56644/\">Regenesis</a></h3><p>Colossus currently resides on Utopia and apart of Cyclops' Extinction team which consists of Cyclops, Emma Frost, Namor, Magneto, Storm, Danger and Magik. The team is called into action upon <a href=\"/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Sinister</a> taking control of the <a href=\"/dreaming-celestial/29-22836/\">Dreaming Celestial</a>. The team begins to fight the Celestial but Colossus gets blasted away. Magik comes to his aid, while Piotr is sitting there with his clothes torn and hole in his chest. Colossus decides it is time to become the Juggernaut which he does. He tells Magik to open a portal quickly which she does and he is back on the battlefield. Colossus is later seen with the team attack Sinister's people until a ceasefire is ordered. Colossus appears to have depowered himself but kept the helmet on due to telepathic resistance. In Sinister's palace, Sinister takes control of the team, Colossus was able to resist due to the helmet but that got blown off by Cyclops. The team is eventually freed thanks to Emma and Hope, who shoots Sinister but he predicts this and they learn Sinister's people have become its own hive-mind.</p><p>Colossus continues to battle the hive-mind. He is with the team when Cyclops proclaims to the <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">Celestials</a> the X-Men will be the guardian of the people and the Dreaming Celestial.</p><p>Colossus is deployed with the rest of the team again as a new habitat has appeared. Colossus pairs himself up with his sister to explore the area. They teleport off where Colossus is astounded by its beauty. Colossus and Magik get assaulted by a group of monsters. Magik gets tranquilized by them and is carried off into the cave system. When Storm calls for Colossus to report in he tells them he is going after his sister and turns into the Juggernaut as he enters the cave. After running through the cave system he stumbles upon Magik unconscious and seems to snap. Magik wakes up and finds body pieces littered all over the cave and Colossus who had transformed into a new Juggernaut like form, almost losing himself. Magik helps reverse the power and reminds Peter to never forget who he is.</p><p>Colossus has a brief talk with Magik in her holding cell and he decides to try and bring it up with Cyclops. They are interrupted by a prison break from the Peak and Colossus helps in stopping some prisoners. He is later teamed with Iron Man, Emma Frost and Red Hulk to defeat Xemnu the Titan using his Juggernaut form. The Extinction team leaves the Avengers to go fight <a href=\"/unit/29-4467/\">Unit</a>. With Unit's defeat the team heads home where Piotr talks with Scott about putting himself in prison with Magik cause he fears the times he may lose his sense of self to Cyttorak.</p><h3><a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/39-56674/\">Avengers vs X-Men</a></h3><p>With the Phoenix Force on its way, the Avengers battle the X-Men for possession of Hope. Colossus battles the Red Hulk and after Rulk thumbs him in the eyes, Colossus snaps entering his second Juggernaut form. He proceeds to beat on Rulk easily but after accidentally damaging a pillar that supports Utopia is damaged, Colossus comes to his senses and rips off his Juggernaut mask. He yells for Rulk to hit him harder so he doesn't lose himself again and Rulk understands as he knocks Colossus out. Colossus is on the moon ready to face off against the Avengers again with the rest of the X-Men. Iron Man used a special suit of armor to shatter the Phoenix Force into five pieces. Colossus along with his sister, Cyclops, Emma Frost and Namor possess a piece. Colossus tried appealing to Cyttorak that he can no longer be his Juggernaut due to having a piece of the Phoenix Force in him. Cyttorak reveled in the fact that Colossus, as a hero, brings about more destruction than Cain did since he spent most of his time slinking away from heroes. Colossus tries to force the release of him being a Juggernaut but Cyttorak easily quells Colossus' attempt at freedom and tells him he will tolerate this infraction for now and teleports him out of the Crimson Cosmos.</p><p>The rest of the Phoenix Five head to Wakanda and upon Namor's defeat there, his part of the Phoenix Force is absorbed by Magik, Colossus, Emma and Cyclops. Colossus and Magik defeat Thor and they throw him into their prison, a portion of Limbo that Magik raised into the Earthly plane. The Rasputin siblings end up fighting the Avengers and in order to buy some time for the Avengers to break the team free, Spider-Man stands up to the two of them. Colossus punches him telling him he does not wish to harm anyone. Magik tells him that he should kill him now and Colossus tells her he does not like what the Phoenix Force is doing to her, and them in general. Spider-Man tricks the two into fighting each other. The Rasputins clash in a fiery blaze of the flaming cosmic energy and both are knocked out and lose their respective portions of the Phoenix Force which goes to Emma and Cyclops.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"75653\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75653-87931-colossus_super.jpg\" title=\"Organic Steel\"><img id=\"75653\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75653-87931-colossus_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Organic Steel\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Organic Steel</div></div></div></div><p>In armored form, Colossus's has superhuman strength which enables him to lift around 100 tons under normal conditions. He has superhuman stamina which means that he will tire much more slowly than regular human beings and can continue exerting himself for days without tiring. While in this state he also does not require food, water or air to sustain himself and can withstand high impact assaults as well as extreme temperatures from 70\u00ba above absolute zero (-390\u00ba F) to approximately 9000\u00ba F. Despite this near-invulnerability, however, it is still possible to injure him. When Colossus is knocked unconscious he is supposed to revert back to his human form, but lately he seems to remain in metal form when knocked out. Whether this is a writer's error or possibly an advancement in his powers is unknown. In his metal form, Colossus bleeds pure energy when injured, and he has no organic organs that can be damaged. A particular flaw in his powers is that he must turn his entire body into metal (for example he can not just change his arm into metallic form). In Colossus's metal shape, he is resistant to magic-based attacks, telepathy and other kinds of psionic attacks.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"919765\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/919765-126_wolverine__first_class_.jpg\" title=\"Fastball Special\"><img id=\"919765\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/919765-126_wolverine__first_class__medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fastball Special\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fastball Special</div></div></div></div><p>Colossus is an skilled hand-to-hand combatant, having received training from Wolverine, Cyclops and Storm. He is trained in both wrestling and judo as well as receiving gymnastics and sword fighting lessons from Nightcrawler. In his human form, he is exceptionally strong and fit, though not superhumanly so. He can lift about 700 pounds. He has also completed college-level courses at Xavier's school.</p><p>It is also worth noting that Colossus only uses these powers in violent situations with the greatest of reluctance. Instead, he feels it is his responsibility to use them for the betterment of others rather than for combat.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2067749\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/2067749-peter.jpg\" title=\"X-Men #20\"><img id=\"2067749\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/85218/2067749-peter_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men #20\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men #20</div></div></div></div><p>As the Avatar or Cyttorak, Colossus has gained a massive power boost. However as oppose to Cain Marko who was constantly in a \"Juggernaut\" type of form, Colossus has to consciously will himself to change into the Juggernaut. While he is in this form he has to control his psyche as Cyttorak's influence apparently makes him more willing to destroy and be violent. It is unknown exactly how much in strength Colossus has increased while in his human, organic-steel or Juggernaut forms. Similar to Cain Marko, Colossus has gained the primary power of the Juggernaut and is unstoppable once he gets moving, but unlike the previous Juggernaut, Colossus has not gained the invulnerability Cain had. He can be hurt by powerful enough physical forces such as hits from the Red Hulk. Colossus is however able to heal himself from severe injuries instantaneously when he transforms into Juggernaut. Colossus is now able to move at incredible speeds and can survive almost any environment. He is capable of destroying entire cities if he moves at his full speed which is currently unknown but he has been clocked at running 600 mph. In times of great stress Colossus can enter a second form more resembling Cyttorak. Colossus grows in size, he becomes much more vicious and powerful as he was casually beating up the Red Hulk. The only problem with this second form is Colossus tends to lose himself and thus must fight to regain control.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p><b>Height:</b> 6'6\"; (transformed) 7'5\"</p><p><b>Weight</b>: 250 lbs., (transformed) 500 lbs.</p><p><b>Eyes</b>: Blue, (transformed) Silver</p><p><b>Hair</b>: None</p><p><b>Skin</b>: White (transformed) Sliver</p><p><u><b>Status</b></u></p><p><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"../../nikolai-rasputin/29-27139/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nikolai Rasputin</a> (father, deceased), <a href=\"../../alexandra-rasputina/29-27140/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alexandra Rasputina</a> (mother, deceased), <a href=\"../../illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Illyana Nikolievna Rasputina</a> (Magik, sister) <a href=\"../../mikhail-rasputin/29-14830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mikhail Rasputin</a> (brother) Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin Jr. (son)</p><p><b>Citizenship</b>: U.S.A.

In this form, his organic steel is smooth and not sectioned. He appears on Japanese TV with Storm and some of the other X-Men and is voted \"Sexiest Mutant.\" Early on in the series he is hinted to be gay. There are many instances where the women of the team foreshadow his sexuality. When <a href=\"../../angel/29-2112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Angel</a> arrives at the Xavier Institute, Storm says that he was looking at him, along with the rest of the girls of the team. He also is seen to be more protective of the male members of the team; for instance when Magneto threatened Wolverine, Colossus beat him to a pulp. Later on in the series, <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a> who had previously shown interest in him, asks Colossus to accompany him to his prom.</p><p>Colossus agrees and goes.

Colossus and the X-Men fought back hard but since Alpha Flight had been using <a href=\"/banshee/18-55849/\">Banshee</a> (a drug that gives/amplifies mutant abilities) they didn't stand a chance. Later when Jean went into Peter's mind, she discovered that he took Banshee and without it, he wouldn't be able to move in his armored form. Colossus gets into a heated fight with Jean, saying that many super heroes take drugs to beat the bad guys. In the end, Colossus left to find Northstar. Cyclops went after him to join him (although as a double agent for Jean) in getting Northstar back. When he found Colossus he also found his Banshee using X-Men, Dazzler, Angel, <a href=\"/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, and Nightcrawler. They went to Alpha Flight's base and with their new found abilities, easily defeated them.

Nightcrawler realizes that they are addicted and alerts Jean Grey, who goes after Colossus' X-Men with her team. The two X-Teams fight until Northstar appears in a wheelchair. Jean-Paul explains that he is alive, but is paralyzed from the waist down. Colossus then comes to his senses and stops fighting. During the fight, Wolverine rips out Peter's heart while he was armored up. Jean later put his heart back but she isn't sure if he can ever change back into his human form.

His mother was the terrorist <a href=\"../../mystique/29-1469/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mystique</a>, who at the time was the wife of <a href=\"../../christian-wagner/29-57077/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Baron Christian Wagner</a>, believed to be the father of Nightcrawler for a long time. In truth, his father is the <a href=\"../../neyaphem/65-45565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Neyaphem</a> warlord, <a href=\"../../azazel/29-40526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azazel</a>, who had a great master plan to impregnate earth women with his children so he could escape the brimstone dimension.</p><p>When Nightcrawler was born, the townsfolk were horrified by Mystique' son's demonic appearance and so she threw him into a river, shape-shifted into another form and then claimed that she had killed the son and the mother. Azazel would not allow his son to die, so he saved him and gave him to one of his other lovers (and servant) <a href=\"../../margali-szardos/29-23007/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margali Szardos</a> to raise. Margali tells a different tale to hide the truth and says that Nightcrawler was discovered by her when she was walking by his house. She discovered his father, Eric Wagner, had died of a heart attack outside and found his mother lying next to him dead.</p><p>Margali took him in and raised him along with her real children <a href=\"/stefan-szardos/29-45358/\">Stefan</a> and Jimaine (later known as <a href=\"../../amanda-sefton/29-10970/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amanda Sefton</a>) at the Bavarian circus. She worked as a fortune teller to hide the truth about her sorcery. Kurt had amazing agility and soon his mutant abilities would manifest. Because of these gifts, he did acrobat shows for the circus audience, while people assumed it was a man in a costume.</p><p>When a millionaire circus owner from <a href=\"../../texas/34-55822/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Texas</a> approached them join his circus, he planned to move the circus to America and demanded that Kurt be in the freak show. Kurt was appalled at this, so he quit the circus and headed to Winzeldorf, <a href=\"../../germany/34-55777/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Germany</a>. He arrives there to find that his brother Stefan went insane and had been murdering children. Kurt battles him, hoping to stop the atrocity, but accidentally kills Stefan by breaking his neck. He tried to tell Margali about her son but she was not at the circus at the time. The coincidence is that, as children, Stefan had made Kurt swear to kill him if ever he took an innocent life. In turn, the villagers thought Kurt was the demon that killed the children.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>NIghtcrawler was created by writer <a href=\"/len-wein/26-41457/\">Len Wein</a> and artist <a href=\"/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\">Dave Cockrum</a>.Cockrum was working for DC comics at the time of his conception, he was originally supposed to be a demon from hell that failed a mission and was banished. He was to be a member of the Legion of Super Heroes. He made his debut in Giant Size X-Men #1 in 1975</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>When he was first introduced, Nightcrawler struggled to be accepted by society at large, as well as by other mutants. Even so, he was usually a light-hearted character, quick to make jest or pull pranks on his fellow X-Men. He was also quite the ladies' man. As time went on, more focus was placed on Nightcrawler's Catholic faith and how he deals with the tragic experiences of his life. He became more of a sullen, introspective character, especially during his time with the team <a href=\"/excalibur/65-14864/\">Excalibur</a>. After returning to the United States, Nightcrawler planned to join the priesthood, but was forced back into the life of costumed adventuring before being officially ordained.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"988877\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/988877-uxm167007_super.jpg\" title=\"Nightcrawler and Storm\"><img id=\"988877\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/988877-uxm167007_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Nightcrawler and Storm\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Nightcrawler and Storm</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> arrived in time to save Kurt from being killed by an angry mob and offered him a chance to join the X-Men. Kurt becomes a valued member of the X-Men and has gone on many missions since joining the team.</p><p>Professor X originally gave Nightcrawler an <a href=\"/image-inducer/18-56520/\">image inducer</a> to hide his appearance in public, but after being accused of being ashamed of his appearance by Wolverine, Nightcrawler threw the image inducer away. During the period when he still used the image inducer, Nightcrawler met an air-stewardess, <a href=\"../../amanda-sefton/29-10970/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amanda Sefton</a>, and often double-dated her and her friend Betsy along with <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>.</p><p>Kurt became extremely happy with his new home and family the X-Men. Eventually he would battle Margali who blamed him for her son\u2019s death. She cursed him into a pocket dimension resembling Dante's Inferno, and kept him trapped there. The X-Men, along with <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a>, helped free Kurt and he explained to Margali about what really happened with her son. They reconciled immediately afterward.</p><p>After the Beyonder left him behind during one of the X-Men\u2019s missions, Kurt began to doubt himself .

During the fight with the <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, Nightcrawler met Mystique and was shocked at how similar their appearances were. When he questioned Mystique, she merely told him to ask his foster mother, Margali Szardos. Before Nightcrawler could question Mystique further, she disappeared. Nightcrawler wouldn't find out the mystery connecting Mystique and him for many years.</p><p>When fighting <a href=\"../../dracula/29-7206/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dracula</a>, the extent of Nightcrawler's religious faith became apparent when he used two stakes to fend off Dracula. Wolverine had previously tried this, but upon hearing Dracula taunt <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a> and say that it would only work for those who believed, Nightcrawler used this knowledge to his advantage. Years later, the X-Men were fighting <a href=\"../../nimrod/29-13314/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nimrod</a>, the supreme <a href=\"../../sentinels/65-4296/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinel</a>. Nightcrawler decided to try injuring Nimrod by teleporting part of it away with him. Unfortunately, this trick had been tried on Nimrod before, so Nimrod simply fired an energy signature disruption at Nightcrawler, causing Kurt to disintegrate. No one even knew if he had survived. Nightcrawler had survived and merely teleported to the New York harbors. While there, he was almost killed by a mob. His teleportation powers had been damaged, and he could now only teleport a few times a day without seriously straining himself.</p><p>Due to his teleporting \"disability\", Nightcrawler was easily beaten by <a href=\"../../riptide/29-9732/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Riptide</a> during the <a href=\"../../mutant-massacre/39-41407/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mutant Massacre</a>, despite a warning from Wolverine. As a result, he wound up mortally wounded and left in a coma on <a href=\"../../muir-island/34-43505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muir Island</a> for several weeks. When he finally awoke, the X-Men were thought to be dead. Kurt then stayed at Muir Island to recuperate for the following few weeks. He also worked out the new limits of his powers: that he could only teleport once a day or else he risked seriously injuring himself.</p><h3>Excalibur</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"346924\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/346924-152207-excalibur_super.jpg\" title=\"Excalibur\"><img id=\"346924\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/346924-152207-excalibur_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Excalibur\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Excalibur</div></div></div></div><p>When the X-Men were believed to be dead, after battling the Adversary in Dallas, Kurt and Kitty, unaware of their former teammates reincarnation, joined <a href=\"../../excalibur/65-14864/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Excalibur</a>.

This caused tensions between him and Captain Britain.</p><p>While at first Captain Britain assumed the leadership role of the team, it wasn't long before Nightcrawler showed his own qualities as a team leader and he took over the position.</p><h3>Return to the X-Men</h3><p>Kurt becomes a leader of the Uncanny team for a period of time leading Wolverine, <a href=\"../../psylocke/29-3176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psylocke</a>, <a href=\"../../marvel-girl/29-3566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Girl</a>, <a href=\"../../cannonball/29-1496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cannonball</a>, and <a href=\"../../bishop/29-1503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bishop</a>.

Xavier then takes a team of X-Men, including Kurt, to go into space and after Vulcan. Kurt was one of the X-Men that returned home from space, along with a newly re-powered Xavier, <a href=\"../../warpath/29-2158/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warpath</a>, <a href=\"../../darwin/29-40600/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darwin</a> and the new member <a href=\"../../hepzibah/29-13868/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hepzibah</a>. Unlike the others, during the Extremists arc, Nightcrawler followed Xavier and attempted to help him on his adventure to find Magneto.</p><h3>Solo Adventures</h3><p>Nightcrawler is given an assignment by <a href=\"../../storm/29-1444/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Storm</a> to investigate a mysterious murder of 13 children at Metro-General Hospital. The problem was all the kids were killed in a locked room. Nightcrawler meets the only survivor who doesn't want to talk to Kurt because of his demonic looks. Kurt then finds burnt hooves marks on the roof of the hospital. Kurt follows the marks roof to roof until they stop at a high rise. There is a party going on and the one throwing it is Dr. Childs. The spying is cut short by yelling in the streets. Another doctor says Dr. Childs is the one who killed the kids. He can't say anything else because he spontaneously burst into flames.</p><p>Kurt jumps from a building and then teleports the man into the lake. To Kurt's surprise, he is still burning and now Kurt is burning. Kurt calls Storm and tells her what happened. She asks him whether the burning was meta or mystical, and tells him he should contact Dr. Strange if it is mystical. Kurt goes to <a href=\"../../limbo/34-42990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Limbo</a> to talk to Amanda Sefton. She tells him that the boy who survived could be a magician and not know it. He tied knots into a string and doesn't know why. Kurt goes back with his image inducer and talks to the kid. The kid tells Kurt he started feeling hot and sick and then he started tying knots into his string and it went away. He then says <a href=\"../../dr-louis-childs/29-44495/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Childs</a> came in and asked him questions. The Dr. Childs came in and told Kurt the interview was over. Kurt yells back and says your not the legal guardian. But Dr. Childs shows a woman and says this is his legal guardian. The boy says that she is not. Kurt walks away with the woman's hands on the boy. He turns around to see a demon holding the boy.</p><p>Kurt talks to the boy again to be interrupted by a nurse, named Christine Palmer who tells him that Dr. Childs was being attacked by the boy's legal guardian. Kurt teleports down and Dr. Childs screams that he can't cross the circle. Kurt teleports and grabs the woman and teleports her into a church. Here a gas comes out of her and she faints. They go to limbo and figure out she was possessed by thirteen demons. She says how she was in a shelter and Dr. Childs came and got her out. But the demons inside her wanted out and they attacked Dr. Childs, that's when he put them in a circle to hold them inside her. They figure out that the boy has been keeping the fourteenth demon inside himself. Dr. Childs visit the boy and tells him their going somewhere private where they can continue his treatments.</p><p>Kurt goes back to the hospital to get Seth. But Dr. Childs already took Seth. Dr. Childs and the boy goes in a room filled with 13 demons in a circle. Dr. Childs goes up to one of the people and says reveal yourself, it was Kurt using his image inducer. Dr.Childs cuts the rope Seth used to keep the demon inside himself, he starts to fell hot and something is coming out of his chest. Kitty comes in and makes the boy intangible and the demon comes smoothly out. The demon kills the people at the party and Amanda comes in and sends the demons back to hell.</p><p>Kurt and the nurse, Christine, that he met in the hospital then started to date. They, Storm and Wolverine then explore the subway when a train goes straight by too fast. Kurt teleports them on the train while Christine jumps on Kurt. She checks the conductor to see whats wrong. Wolverine makes sure the passengers stay sitting down. Storm short circuits the wires. Kurt then sees a person out on the railroads. He teleports there and the man tries to kill him with a mining tool only to have him pass right by Kurt and disappear. Storm and Logan leave the city with Kurt and his girlfriend. The city wants to talk with someone who has been at the incident. The mayor tells Kurt about the disturbances and asks him to go in the subway and check it out. Nightcrawler is then in the middle of a group of ghosts.</p><p>Kurt touches one of the ghosts and sees his whole history. He sees him working in the mines where that subway is. The ghost attacks Kurt so he fights back. Kurt then stops, asking the ghosts if they need help. They lead him to a tool that was left there by someone. He takes it to <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a> with no results. Then he takes it to Amanda who tells him how old it is. Kurt goes to the mayor's speech and tells him to pat tribute to the workers who died in the mines. The ghosts are there and start vanishing.</p><p>Kurt is having dreams about his life and his history. He travels with his girlfriend and Logan to his circus. It's still there but it is engulfed by flames. Margali travels to limbo to see Amanda tied up and bruised by a demon. Kurt comes to the circus and helps everyone. He remembers someone there named Amos Jardine, who drugged him and put him in a cage. They then find that Amos is possessed by a demon. It is revealed that he is the same demon who caused Kurt's brother, Stephen, to go mad and kill some innocent children. Margali then captures the demon and asks him why he is here. Nightcrawler looks outside and sees three demons and a big group of zombies. Nightcrawler and Logan fight the demons and zombies. Just in time, Amanda comes in and destroys all the demons and zombies.</p><p>During the <a href=\"../../messiah-complex/39-48995/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Messiah CompleX</a>, Nightcrawler took out <a href=\"../../exodus/29-4567/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus</a> when the X-Men first attacked the Marauders, by teleporting him outside and slamming his face into the snowy floor. Kurt also beat Omega Sentinel and Mastermind when they were cornering Wolverine. He was then gravely injured by <a href=\"../../scalphunter/29-9734/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scalphunter</a>, who shot him. Nightcrawler was out of action until New X-Men #46, when he teleported all the injured out of the Med Lab after a Predator infiltrated the mansion, but was then teleported with the others to <a href=\"../../muir-island/34-43505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muir Island</a> by Pixie, and took part in the final battle.</p><h3>Divided We Stand</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"360339\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/360339-58172-divided-we-stand_super.jpg\" title=\"Divided We Stand\"><img id=\"360339\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/360339-58172-divided-we-stand_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Divided We Stand\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Divided We Stand</div></div></div></div><p>After the X-Men were \"disbanded\" because of the supposed death of Professor X, Nightcrawler, Colossus and Wolverine go to <a href=\"../../europe/34-56099/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Europe</a>. While there, Wolverine and Nightcrawler have a war of pranks. The only prank revealed to the readers was when Wolverine messes with Nightcrawler's image inducer, making him appear as if he's Angelina Jolie. Nightcawler, as Jolie, is photographed with her new \"boyfriend\", Colossus. After a visit to <a href=\"../../russia/34-55706/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Russia</a>, the three are traveling back through Europe by train. Suddenly, they're ambushed by Red Room robots. Wolverine begins to fight, and Nightcrawler teleports Colossus outside. Both Colossus and Nightcrawler are then shot by one of the robots and begin to fall. Wolverine then jumps to catch Kurt, and puts himself underneath Nightcrawler, so when they hit land he'll take most of the force. When they wake, Wolverine is in a room connected to a machine that will shock him whenever their captor feels like it, until Colossus tells him what he wants - which is why The X-Men survived M-Day. Peter says no. The man then brings in Nightcrawler, who has a neck holder that will shock him if he tries to teleport. He threatens to kill him unless Colossus tells him what he wants. Peter reluctantly refuses. He then gives the order for him to be killed, but at the last moment, Kurt teleports onto Wolverine's restraints. The electric shock that then runs through Nightcrawler's body also overloads Wolverine's restraints. This means he is free to kill the guards. As Nightcrawler, Wolverine and Colossus make their escape, they encounter Omega Red. After a difficult fight, Omega is defeated by Nightcrawler teleporting him higher and higher into the air, and dropping him.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><p>In Second Coming, When Hope and Cable return to the present , Cyclops dispatches a team to retrieve them and return them to safety. Nightcrawler is part of this and on the way the group runs into enemy forces whom they neutralise. Before any real interrogation starts, <a href=\"/x-23/29-3560/\">X-23</a> brutally executes one of the soldiers, causing the secret of X-Force to be revealed. Kurt threatens to quit in disgust, but Colossus convinces him otherwise and he reluctantly stays.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1247460\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26874/1247460-g_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1247460\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26874/1247460-g_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Later on, in Nevada, during the confrontation between <a href=\"../../bastion/29-40568/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bastion</a> and a multi-powered <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogue</a>, Bastion ends up gravely injuring Rogue and moves in to kill <a href=\"/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope Summers</a>. Nightcrawler teleports in between them and is subsequently impaled on Bastion's arm. Praying to God for \"one last jump,\" Nightcrawler successfully teleports to <a href=\"../../utopia/34-56536/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utopia</a> with Hope and tells her that he believes in her before passing away.</p><p>Despite major flak for too many character deaths in the Marvel Universe holding little weight or necessity other than \"killing for the shock of a character dying\", the critical response of Nightcrawler's death was overall positive. Many critics stated that Nightcrawler's death was properly in line with the character's belief structure as well as moral implications.</p><p><b>Wolverine Goes To Hell</b></p><p>Kurt was next seen during the battle between Wolverine and the demon that was possessing his body. He realized that Wolverine would lose his mind and body if he did not help him. As a result, Kurt went to a special part of Wolverine's mind where he housed his image of Jean Grey so they can defeat the demon. When Kurt and Jean showed up in the battle they asked Kurt if he was a part of Wolverine's mind, however, he replied saying that he is the actual Nightcrawler. After the battle Kurt begged Wolverine to not seek revenge on those who did this to him, however, he refused to listen.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"82081\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1124/82081-120033-nightcrawler_super.jpg\" title=\"BAMF\"><img id=\"82081\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1124/82081-120033-nightcrawler_medium.jpg\" alt=\"BAMF\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">BAMF</div></div></div></div><p>Kurt's mutant power is teleportation. He is actually opening a portal to and traveling almost instantaneously through another dimension. When teleporting, Kurt leaves behind a whiff of brimstone and a characteristic \"bamf\" sound as the air rushes into the space where he once was. After some training sessions, Kurt has developed the ability to bring more with him when he teleports, including water or other people. Kurt's teleportation range is limited, but he can travel up to two miles. He must also have visited the place before, or he risks teleporting into a solid object, which could be fatal as two things cannot occupy the same space in that particular instant in time. Kurt has a spatial awareness, which means depending on the distance he teleports he has a way of not ending up in walls.</p><p>This style of teleportation is physically demanding not only for Kurt, but particularly for others he brings along with him who are not used to it. When used offensively, the stress of rapid succession of teleports can incapacitate a normal person or cause nausea. It has been hinted that his physiology may make travel less physically stressful. His teleportation is more easily done following the magnetic poles of the earth (north and south) he can travel about 3 miles north and south and 2 miles east and west. His power can also be used more aggressively than this: He can grab a hold of, say, a person's head, and then teleport, concentrating in taking only the head with him (AoA), effectively killing his enemy, although in the 616 reality, Kurt has never done this because of his high regard for human life.</p><p>The upper limits of his powers were shown during the Second Coming story arc. Rogue tells Cyclops that Kurt has teleported over 300 miles in under a minute with a passenger. After he has been impaled on Bastion's arm, Nightcrawler teleports from Nebraska to Utopia with Hope and Bastion's arm.</p><p>Kurt has many demonic traits in his appearance. He is covered with dark blue fur, has yellow eyes, long sharp canines, and pointed ears. His hands and feet are both larger than average, with two large fingers and a thumb on each hand and two large toes with a toe-like protrusion on his heels (which allows him to grip with his feet). Despite his unusual fingers, he is shown to possess superhuman dexterity. He also has a prehensile tail that is strong enough to lift his own weight, he can use his tail to fight with a sword, grab things and can even hang from it.</p><p>The dimension he travels through constantly bends the light around him, making him appear in shadow during normal daylight and rendering him nearly invisible in the dark. There has been dispute over whether Nightcrawler's agility level is actually superhuman, or if his life as a circus acrobat has caused him to be extremely (but not superhumanly) agile, although it has been suggested that his spine is unnaturally flexible. Kurt also possesses, speed, and stealth, as well as the ability to cling to any surface, and is a skilled swordsman.</p><h2>Personal Information</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"96635\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/96635-56727-nocturne_super.jpg\" title=\"Kurt and his daughter Nocturne\"><img id=\"96635\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/96635-56727-nocturne_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt and his daughter Nocturne\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kurt and his daughter Nocturne</div></div></div></div><p><b>Height:</b> 5' 9\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 161 lbs.</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Yellow</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Indigo</p><p><b>Skin:</b> Blue</p><p><b>Unique Traits</b>: Only three fingers on each hand, two long toes pointing forward and one long toe-like projection pointing backward, a prehensile tail, pointed ears, fang-like canine teeth, and his body is coated with a blue-colored fur.</p><p><b>Nationality:</b> German</p><p><b>Place of Birth:</b> Bavaria, Germany</p><p><b>Education:</b> Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (College Level Courses)</p><p><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer, former Priest, Circus Performer</p><p><b>Known Relatives</b>: <a href=\"../../azazel/29-40526/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azazel</a> (Father), <a href=\"../../mystique/29-1469/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raven Darkholme</a> (AKA Mystique, Mother), <a href=\"../../graydon-creed/29-13351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graydon Creed</a> (Half-Brother, Deceased), <a href=\"../../abyss/29-15323/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nils Styger</a> (AKA Abyss, Half-Brother), <a href=\"../../kiwi-black/29-45566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiwi Black</a> (Half-Brother), <a href=\"../../margali-szardos/29-23007/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Margali Szardos</a> (Foster Mother), <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogue</a> (foster sister), <a href=\"../../amanda-sefton/29-10970/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Amanda Sefton</a> (AKA Magik, Foster Sister), <a href=\"../../stefan-szardos/29-45358/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stefan Szardos</a> (Foster Brother, Deceased), <a href=\"../../nocturne/29-4565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talia Wagner</a> (AKA Nocturne, Alternate Timeline Daughter)</p><h2><b>Alternate Realities</b></h2><p><b>Earth-295: Age of Apocalypse</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"363218\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18474/363218-27818-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse\"><img id=\"363218\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18474/363218-27818-mystique_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>The Nightcrawler of this reality is known as Kurt Darkholme.

After the kidnapping of Charles Xavier by <a href=\"../../cable/29-2157/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cable</a>, Nightcrawler escaped the mansion, looking for a place where he can fit in.

Tabitha Smith is a character Kurt seemed to have vague feelings for, but Amanda Sefton ended up being his girlfriend in the end. It was not specified if Kurt and Amanda ended up together, but they were just episodes before the series finale.</p><p><b>Wolverine &amp; the X-Men</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"779241\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38381/779241-untitled_1_super.png\" title=\"Wolverine &amp; the X-Men\"><img id=\"779241\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38381/779241-untitled_1_medium.png\" alt=\"Wolverine &amp; the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine & the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Kurt was on a ship going to <a href=\"../../genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha</a> together with other mutants. He became friends with Squid Boy and other mutants en route to Genosha. They defeated the <a href=\"../../reavers/65-9726/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reavers</a> with their united abilities while on the ship. His origins were shown through flashback, as the circus complex from canon comics are used in this incarnation. Kurt joined the refugees heading to Genosha instead of rejoining the X-Men when they came for him, sharing a tender moment with Kitty Pryde before declining. Then in Genosha, he met Scarlet Witch and was introduced to this new mutant haven. He developed a good friendship with her. However, <a href=\"../../dust/29-4555/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dust</a> warned him about the true intentions of Magneto for creating Genosha, Nightcrawler became more curious and discovered Magneto's real intention. As a result, Scarlet Witch attacked him. However, his teleportation had saved him for the time being. He teleported with the best of his ability, over to the Institute and tried to inform the X-Men. But when he arrived , he was beaten by Mystique taking the form of his fellow comrade, Wolverine. Then, he was taken back to Genosha, and imprisoned.</p><p>After several days, maybe weeks, <a href=\"../../mojo/29-6755/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mojo</a> and his gang kidnap the Scarlet Witch and Wagner, and imprison them in a submarine forest. There they fought for their lives against a brainwashed Wolverine and several other dangers. In the end, they survived, including Wolverine, and made their way back to the institute. Kurt asked Scarlet Witch to come back with him, knowing well she didn't belong next to her father. She declined rather politely, and went back to her father, and he back to his former life. It was hinted several times in the episode Battle Lines that Kurt and Pryde resumed their close friendship.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"791038\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38381/791038-wanda_kurt_super.png\" title=\"Wanda kisses Kurt\"><img id=\"791038\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38381/791038-wanda_kurt_medium.png\" alt=\"Wanda kisses Kurt\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wanda kisses Kurt</div></div></div></div><p>It was hinted and shown several times that the Scarlet Witch harbors some intense feelings for Kurt. Her sister, <a href=\"../../polaris/29-1473/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Polaris</a>, mentioned that she was 'in love with an X-Man,' which implies Kurt, because he and Wolverine were the only X-Men she's ever encountered, and Kurt's the only one she's spent enough time to get to know about. When Kurt yelled that she wasn't the love of his life during the battle in the submarine forest, the look on her face was priceless. She also went as far as kiss him. Kurt on the other hand, has expressed several times throughout the season that he does not love the Scarlet Witch, but may as well harbor some lingering feelings anyway.</p><p>Wagner's last scenes before the first season ended were with him fallen alongside Pryde during the three-way battle with Magneto's Sentinels, the Phoenix, and the <a href=\"../../hellfire-club/65-13357/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellfire Club</a>.

One major difference between the comic book Nightcrawler and his film counterpart is that he wears ordinary civilian clothing as opposed to an X-Man uniform, as he is not actually a member of the X-Men in the film (or in the tie-in video game either), but instead an ally of the team. Also, the flash of smoke that accompanies Nightcrawler's teleportation ability appears a dark navy blue in the film, as opposed to the bright reddish-purple as it appears in the comics.</p><p>Unlike the traditional versions, in the movie Nightcrawler has blue flesh instead of blue fur. His skin is also decorated by angelic symbols which reflects the spirituality of the character's faith and his devout practice of Catholicism. In the film, Nightcrawler is brainwashed with a fluid from William Stryker's mutant son in order to attempt an assassination on the President of the United States. The opening scenes of the movie are almost a showcase of Nightcrawler's powers, with him versus the Secret Service, defeating them in a memorable fashion. Storm and Jean Grey are sent to find him and bring him back to the mansion, and Wagner goes with them. He helps Storm save the children and stop Stryker's Cerebro at the Alkali Lake facility and joins the team at the end, saving Charles when Stryker's Cerebro was destroyed.</p><h3><b>Video Games</b></h3><p><b>X-Men: Next Dimension</b></p><p>In this game, Nightcrawler can teleport toward, behind, or above the opponent, following it with any attack he chooses. He also carries a large sword he uses to deadly effect. Nightcrawler's incredible acrobatic attacks rival the other agile fighters greatly, which include Beast and Toad.</p><p><b>X-Men Legends</b></p><p>Nightcrawler also appeared as a playable character<i>.</i></p><p><b>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse</b></p><p>To his credit, Nightcrawler possesses the most powerful ultimate ability in the second game.

Hank McCoy\u2019s father was exposed to radiation during a meltdown when working at the nuclear power plant. Because of this, it seems to be the reason why Hank was born with unusually large feet and hands and a high I.Q.He had a huge curiosity since child, disarming all around so he could understand the function of everything and to create hypothesis. Because of his irregular proportions, his schoolmates teased him and gave him the nickname of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magilla-gorilla/29-55610/\">\"Magilla Gorilla</a>\" and \"Beast\". Hank only started to come out of his shell when he started tutoring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jennifer-nyles/29-59119/\">Jennifer Nyles</a>. She started to see the real Hank McCoy, and on the night of the prom she turned up at his place with a rented tuxedo and told him she was taking him to the prom. When some people started to tease them, Jennifer knocked out the leader of the taunters with one punch.</p><p>After that Hank and Jennifer were inseparable, and in love with each other, but still not going out. During Hank's teen years, his mutant abilities started to show themselves and allowed him to become a super sports star and excel in the academic side of school. Hank ended up joining the football team after the coach asked him to kick a football and he kicked the skin off it. However, this caused jealousy amongst his classmates.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074336\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074336-968645_xmnaoa001023_color1_super_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men\"><img id=\"1074336\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074336-968645_xmnaoa001023_color1_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Sadly, Hank and Jennifer went their separate ways; she traveled to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/london/34-55798/\">London</a> to study genetics whilst Hank stayed in the United States. One day, three masked men robbed the stadium and tried to escape across it. Luckily, Hank was nearby and he managed to knock out all three men. This made it to the news. The villain known only as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/el-conquistador/29-38214/\">Conquistador</a> decided that he could use Hank as a weapon after seeing this report. The Conquistador successfully managed to kidnap Hank and his parents, and told him that he would release them when he stole an experimental nuclear device.</p><p>When Hank returned, the Conquistador revealed that he would actually keep Hank's parents prisoners indefinitely, until Hank was of no more use to him. Hank tried to escape and was almost killed if it wasn't for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Charles Xavier</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> saving Hank, before offering a spot for him in Xavier's school ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>). The school was a haven for mutants and also the headquarters of the mutant team, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>. Hank took advantage of the offer, mainly in order to further his academic intelligence and ended up completing his doctorate in biophysics at Xavier's. There, he received the codename \"Beast.\"</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Beast was created by the team of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> for the first X-Men book.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Beast originally started out as a man with larger appendages and a keen intellect. He would undergo two changes in appearance: the first was into a man with blue fur and claws; the second was a further mutation into a more feline looking animal with the same blue fur. He would maintain his intellect through each change.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074342\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074342-181730_44794_x_men_super_super.jpg\" title=\"First Class\"><img id=\"1074342\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074342-181730_44794_x_men_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"First Class\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">First Class</div></div></div></div><p>After an occasion when Beast saved a falling child, he quit the X-Men, as he was sick of protecting a world that hated and feared him. He started a career as a wrestler, still calling himself the Beast. But one of Hank's opponents was none other than <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/unus/29-3438/\">Unus the Untouchable</a>, who was also a mutant. Hank realized that his place was still with the X-Men, and built a device to increase Unus's powers to the point where he couldn't control them. He only decreased them to their original level after Unus vowed not to join the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>. With that done, Hank rejoined the X-Men. He also started dating a librarian named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vera-cantor/29-15374/\">Vera Cantor</a> thanks to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman's</a> girlfriend ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zelda/29-13327/\">Zelda</a>) setting him up with a blind date. Unfortunately, their first meeting was interrupted by Vera's ex-boyfriend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mimic/29-12546/\">Calvin Rankin</a>. Calvin was a mutant who could copy the powers of other mutants, and he was at first a villain, but later joined the X-Men for a short while.</p><p>Over time, Xavier granted the X-Men new costumes as a reward for proving themselves time after time. Hank received a new blue-and-red costume which was similar to his training costume. Not much later after that, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\">Kraven the Hunter</a> appeared, who wanted to test his skill against Beast. Kraven poisoned the X-Men's house guest, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avia/29-13319/\">Avia</a>, and would only give the antidote if he was allowed to fight Beast without interruption. Kraven wasn't the type to play fairly, and he had traps all around the house to try and stop Beast. Hank couldn't dodge them all and was hit by some drugged darts. The darts had been meant to slow down the blood flow to Beast's brain, thus slowing his reflexes, but had a side-effect. With Hank's higher-brain functions inhibited, it made him revert to a frenzied rage, and would have killed Kraven if the X-Men hadn't stopped him. After this fight, Beast held back in action in case another incident like this occurred.</p><h3>The Brand Corporation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"689994\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/689994-beast14_super.jpg\" title=\"Hirsute Hank\"><img id=\"689994\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29735/689994-beast14_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Hirsute Hank\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hirsute Hank</div></div></div></div><p>Hank went on to work as a genetic researcher at a corporation called \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brand-corporation/65-32019/\">Brand Corporation</a>.\" At Brand Corporation Hank met his assistant, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/linda-donaldson/29-37198/\">Linda Donaldson</a>, and his bitter superior, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carl-maddicks/29-30821/\">Carl Maddicks</a>. Hank successfully managed to create the hormonal extract that creates mutations in organic beings, but when he rushed to tell Carl Maddicks about it he overheard him discussing a plan to steal some government records. Hank took his extract to disguise himself and increase his power. Unfortunately, Hank had the extract in him for too long, therefore leaving him permanently transformed. This enhanced his agility, stamina and strength. Other side effects were the growth of fangs, pointed ears, claws, enhanced senses, a healing factor and blue (originally gray) fur that covered his entire body. Hank then completed his doctorate in genetics and is one of the world's experts on mutations and human biology. As a result of the failure, Linda Donaldson shot Carl Maddicks, since she was actually a spy for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-empire/65-15136/\">Secret Empire</a>.</p><p>Hank knew that he couldn't walk around looking like a gorilla, so he spent all night reading up on latex masks and disguises before making gloves and a rubber face mask that he could wear over his own. Hank's posture was also like that of a gorilla, and he had to use a special harness to help him walk and stand like an ordinary man. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> visited Brand, a crisis required him and Hank to go to the rescue as superheroes. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> mistook Beast for a villain, and fought with him. The X-Men's old foe <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a> watched from a distance and created the illusion in Hank's mind of him having killed Iron Man. Hank was then easily tricked into joining the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, but he managed to overcome the illusion and leave.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"113150\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/113150-58885-beast_super.jpg\" title=\"Gray Beast\"><img id=\"113150\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/113150-58885-beast_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Gray Beast\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gray Beast</div></div></div></div><p>Since Beast had been seen around Brand Corporation a lot, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-pentagon/34-55834/\">Pentagon</a> sent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/buzz-baxter/29-12726/\">Buzz Baxter</a> and his wife <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patsy-walker/29-3316/\">Patsy Walker</a> to investigate. Ironically, Beast turned up at Patsy's house after a near defeat from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasimodo/29-7230/\">Quasimodo</a>. Patsy helped heal Hank, and for some reason his fur turned from gray to bluish-black. Patsy also learned Beast's real identity, since he had been talking in his dreams. She agreed not to reveal his secret, but didn't tell Hank what she wanted in return. Shortly after wards, Hank was captured by Linda Donaldson, and delivered to the Secret Empire. Along with some of his old teammates, Hank was held captive until he was freed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>.</p><h3>The Avengers</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"156903\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7019/156903-181557-avengers_super.jpg\" title=\"Avengers Assemble!\"><img id=\"156903\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7019/156903-181557-avengers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Avengers Assemble!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Avengers Assemble!</div></div></div></div><p>Beast couldn't return to Brand Corporation after being captured by Linda Donaldson. Hank decided to try being a superhero with another group after he saw an ad for new members on TV. Beast and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> were accepted as probationary members, mere minutes before the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stranger/29-13332/\">Stranger</a> attacked the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> (actually <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a> in disguise). \"The Stranger\" filled a stadium with floating mines, which the other Avengers were defeated by, but Beast's agility let him get through the mines whilst Moondragon's mental powers stopped their foe. Whilst a member of the Avengers, Beast became good friends with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>.</p><p>With Beast a member of the Avengers, it was only a matter of time before <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patsy-walker/29-3316/\">Patsy Walker</a> returned. It turned out that the deal she had made with Beast in return for not revealing his identity was that she was to become a superhero, since she was bored of being a housewife. Beast had already revealed his alternate identity to the rest of the Avengers, though, so she had nothing to hold over him. Even so, Beast let Patsy accompany them on one mission to repay her for not revealing his identity. Whilst raiding <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roxxon/65-56010/\">Roxxon</a> Oil, the Avengers came across the old gear of the Cat (who didn't need it now that she was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tigra/29-21188/\">Tigra</a>). Patsy used the equipment to become <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patsy-walker/29-3316/\">Hellcat</a>, which meant she got her wish to become a superhero after all. Moondragon and Hellcat both left the Avengers when they restarted their roster, but Beast was more than happy to stay on. One of the many bonuses of being an Avenger was that Beast was no longer hated or feared as a mutant.</p><p>Sometimes Beast would leave to help with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> when they were in need of help and to make space for new recruits. One time that he temporarily left was when he hadn't heard from the X-Men in a while, and went to the mansion to check up on them. For some reason, the mansion was abandoned. Beast went looking for the X-Men with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebro/18-15073/\">Cerebro</a> and found them performing as freaks in a carnival. It turned out that the carnival was run by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mesmero/29-5065/\">Mesmero</a>, but shortly after the X-Men were broken free from his hypnosis, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> captured the X-Men and took them to his secret base in</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1081485\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4_super.jpg\" title=\"Gyrich and the Avengers\"><img id=\"1081485\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1081485-a189_17_4_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Gyrich and the Avengers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gyrich and the Avengers</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/antarctica/34-55940/\">Antarctica</a>, which was hidden beneath an active volcano.

One problem that they Avengers had was that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Peter Gyrich</a> of the National Security Agency limited the members of the Avengers allowed. Whilst Beast was on this team, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a> unfortunately was not, and so Beast's best friend on the Avengers had to leave. Shortly after Hank found out that the X-Men were still alive after the events in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/antarctica/34-55940/\">Antarctica</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Gyrich</a> continued to plague the Avengers, this time trying to get rid of their government clearance.</p><p>The Avengers had a trial in court, and it was not going well, but when reports of a rampaging monster were heard, Beast suggested that Gyrich should fight the monster himself. Gyrich had to admit that the heroes were needed, and so the Avengers got back their security clearances. Shortly afterwards, Falcon quit the team, and Wonder Man was called back to replace him. One night, when Hank was on duty by himself, he received a message that the X-Men were on a rampage in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a>. Torn between friends and responsibility, Hank decided to aid the X-Men. Beast witnessed Jean Grey's transformation to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-phoenix/29-9731/\">Dark Phoenix</a>, a fight between the X-Men and the Shi'ar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">Imperial Guard</a> on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-moon/34-42072/\">the Moon</a>, Jean's suicide, and her funeral before he returned to the Avengers.</p><p>Beast met his old girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vera-cantor/29-15374/\">Vera Cantor</a> in a bar by complete chance, and the two talked all night. Beast took her back to Avenger's mansion, but upon drinking some tea <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a> provided, Vera fell into a coma. \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jarvis/29-1781/\">Jarvis</a>\" was actually a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull</a> who had poisoned Vera so that she could be used as blackmail. He told the Avengers that he would only provide Vera with a cure to her coma if the Avengers got a rare artifact called the Resurrection Stone for him. The team used the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four's</a> time travel device to acquire the item in the past for the Skrull, but Hank destroyed it before they handed it to him, since it was too powerful to trust the Skrull with. The best the Avengers could do for Vera was to give her to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> in the hope that he could find a cure for her coma.</p><p>Despite that they had been glad that Henry Gyrich was not longer bugging them, the Avengers realized there were some things he had done that made sense. For example, the current team had 10 members, and was too unorganized. After a talk with Wonder Man, Beast began to realize if he really did just want to be a joking superhero. Beast then quit the Avengers.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/defenders/65-26333/\"><b>Defenders</b></a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074349\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074349-182263_173817_defenders_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Defenders\"><img id=\"1074349\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074349-182263_173817_defenders_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Defenders\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Defenders</div></div></div></div><p>Beast went to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, looking for his help to save Vera Cantor's life. With <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellstorm/29-14695/\">Hellstorm</a> and Reed Richards, they were able to destroy the Resurrection Stone once and for all, and Hellstorm was able to cure Vera. To repay the favor to Doctor Strange, Beast helped him find his missing teammates, who had been captured by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-empire/65-15136/\">Secret Empire</a>, and joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/defenders/65-26333/\">Defenders</a>. Beast opened up to Vera his insecurities about being a superhero, and she tried to help Beast by pushing him into a relationship. Because Beast was silent, Vera mistook this for agreement, when it was actually insecurity.</p><p>Beast eventually realized that super heroics are what he's best at, but still didn't like the Defenders' status as a non-team. Beast reorganized the Defenders, adding his old teammates Iceman and Angel to it, as well as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gargoyle/29-7114/\">Gargoyle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valkyrie/29-6809/\">Valkyrie</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a>. With <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury's</a> help, the new team got government clearance, but there was a problem when both Beast and Valkyrie applied to be the leader of the team. After an argument between the two, they realized that they didn't need an actual leader, but someone to run headquarters, deal with the authorities and other such things.</p><p>The person they appointed for this was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/candy-southern/29-13320/\">Candy Southern</a>. Whilst a Defender, Beast wrote a letter to Vera Cantor, apologizing, and when they next met, it was as friends, even though their mutual attraction was still there. Unfortunately, Moondragon and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gargoyle/29-7114/\">Gargoyle</a> were both taken over by a mystical enemy called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dragon-of-the-moon/29-56928/\">Dragon of the Moon</a>. An Eternal called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/interloper/29-14605/\">Interloper</a> was able to defeat the Dragon of the Moon, but only if some people sacrificed themselves. With the exception of the three former X-Men, all of the Defenders sacrificed themselves. With this event, the Defenders disbanded.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/49-3657/\"><b>X-Factor</b></a></h3><p>A few weeks later, the Avengers found a mysterious cocoon at the bottom of Jamaica Bay. They sent it to Reed Richards to examine, and when he cut it open Jean Grey came out. Shocked at the state of mutant affairs in the world, Jean wanted to do something about it, but not as an X-Man, since the X-Men were being led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>. Jean, Beast, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> and Cyclops all rejoined and they formed the group called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a>. On their second mission, Hank was kidnapped by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carl-maddicks/29-30821/\">Carl Maddicks</a>, who was apparently alive, for experimentation to find a \"cure\" for his son <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/artie/29-10574/\">Artie's</a> mutation. This turned Beast back into a human form. Hank also met with Vera Cantor more, who had a change of appearance. She now wore her hair half shaved and wore flashier clothing. After Vera was interviewed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trish-tilby/29-3178/\">Trish Tilby</a>, a reporter hot on X-Factor's trail, Vera and Hank stopped seeing each other, as their lives had gone in different directions.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074354\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074354-118625_87748_x_factor_super_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Factor\"><img id=\"1074354\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074354-118625_87748_x_factor_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>During a fight with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse's</a> Horsemen, Beast was touched by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pestilence/29-24133/\">Pestilence</a>, whose virus causes a deadly sickness. Instead of Hank becoming sick, it reacted with Hank's recent change so that every time he used his superhuman strength, Beast's intelligence would drop. Hank's intelligence dropped for weeks and he opened up to Trish Tilby, not realizing that she would use the information on TV. Out of respect for Hank, Trish did tell the world that one of X-Factor's members was losing his intelligence, but didn't say which. When Iceman was almost kissed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infectia/29-15089/\">Infectia</a>, who could mutate people into monsters by touch, Beast intercepted the kiss. This made him change between his furry form and human form, until he finally stayed in his furred form, with his usual intelligence and strength. The next time Hank met Trish, she was having trouble accepting Hank's new furry form. Hank and Trish realized they had missed each other after a mission in space, and started dating.</p><p>Trish's duties as a news reporter caused some trouble with their relationship, since she had to make mutants look bad. During one of Trish's assignments in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/india/34-55919/\">India</a>, Hank came over to say goodbye to her, only to see her kissing her ex-husband, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paul/29-65539/\">Paul</a>. Seeing this, Hank left without saying bye to Trish. One day, Hank was invited to attend the International Symposium on Mutant Research in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/belgium/34-55916/\">Belgium</a>. Hank wanted to take this very seriously, as his old girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jennifer-nyles/29-59119/\">Jennifer Nyles</a> would be attending the conference and a cyborg tried to kill the mail woman who was delivering the letter to tell him that he would be invited. Whilst at the conference, Hank uncovered a plot involving cyborgs and genetic programming. The leader of this conspiracy, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/commander-courage/29-61508/\">Commander Courage</a>, was going to infect world leaders with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/techno-organic/12-43631/\">techno-organic</a> implants and take over the world.</p><p>Jennifer Nyles was unknowingly working on this, since when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Xavier</a> had mind wiped her all those years ago, she knew something precious in her mind had gone, and devoted her life to getting it back. After meeting Beast, Jennifer's memories came back and she helped stop Commander Courage. It was later discovered that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a> had taken over the minds of almost everyone on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a>. Since that included most of the X-Men, Professor X enlisted the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> and X-Factor to stop <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a>. After the battle, X-Factor merged with the X-Men, and the team was split into a Gold Strike team and a Blue Strike team. Beast was on the Blue strike team.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legacy-virus/12-42281/\"><b>Legacy Virus</b></a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074356\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074356-673936_x_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Genius at work\"><img id=\"1074356\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074356-673936_x_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Genius at work\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Genius at work</div></div></div></div><p>During the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-cutioners-song/39-42178/\">X-Cutioner's Song</a>, Professor Xavier was shot in the head by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stryfe/29-7616/\">Stryfe</a>, and infected with a techno-organic virus. Both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a> and Beast attempted to save his life, but couldn't find any solutions. It wasn't until the deadly villain Apocalypse offered his assistance that Professor X could be cured. Before he died, Stryfe got his revenge on the X-Men by releasing the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legacy-virus/12-42281/\">Legacy Virus</a> into the atmosphere. The Legacy Virus is a virus that is deadly to mutants, attacking their x-factor gene and killing them. Watching <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> together, Beast also started to question what he had accomplished in his life, as he was turning thirty. Professor Xavier and Moira MacTaggert only added to these doubts when they excluded him from their research on the Legacy Virus. Hank had a look at their research and admitted that it was far beyond him.</p><p>Despite this, Beast still tried to cure the Virus, going to extremes. Beast allowed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mister Sinister</a> access to a mutant named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/threnody/29-15116/\">Threnody</a>, who could sense the effects of the Legacy Virus, since Sinister had more resources and less morals, which gave him more of a chance to cure it. Beast managed to get Sinister's notes on the Legacy Virus by breaking into Sinister's base, using information provided by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>, who at the time was the X-Men's captive. Beast's girlfriend, Trish Tilby, somehow got information about the Legacy Virus and released it to the public. Feeling betrayed, Beast broke up with her.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1842889\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1842889-1261702_hankmccoy0119l_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Cure for the Legacy Virus\"><img id=\"1842889\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1842889-1261702_hankmccoy0119l_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cure for the Legacy Virus\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cure for the Legacy Virus</div></div></div></div><p>Beast's work on the Legacy Virus became an obsession with him. He was curious when he found some of his formulas completed for him. Beast followed the trail of the person who had finished his formulas, which led to the abandoned <a href=\"/brand-corporation/34-51523/\">Brand Corporation</a>. There, Beast was captured by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a>, who had escaped the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a>. Dark Beast joined the X-Men, pretending to be the real Beast, whilst the real one was kept locked up with a tiny supply of water, in case Dark Beast needed any more information from him. Beast wasn't free until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a> revealed himself to the X-Men, and Dark Beast joined him. Since he had been locked up for so long, it gave Hank time to think about what he should do and what he valued, and he called up Trish Tilby to apologize and make up with her.</p><p>Beast eventually managed to find a cure for the Legacy Virus, but the only way for it to work was if a mutant sacrificed themselves. Whilst Hank looked for an alternative, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> activated the cure when no one was looking, sacrificing himself to save mutant kind.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-treme-x-men/49-9411/\"><b>X-Treme X-Men</b></a></h3><p>After mourning the loss of a teammate, Hank briefly leaves the school with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> and her X-Treme X-Men team in search of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destinys-diaries/18-44250/\">Destiny's diaries</a>.

Hank returned to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a> becoming the resident scientist and teacher at the <a>Xavier Institute of Higher Learning</a>. During this time, Beast further mutates in form and takes on a more feline appearance.</p><p>Beast was one of the few X-Men fond of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> when she joined the team; everyone else was wary that she hadn't reformed and was still a villain. When Emma was shot whilst in her diamond form, Beast worked day and night to put every piece of her diamond form back together. His efforts were not in vain, as Jean Grey was able to use her telekinesis to fuse the diamond shards together and bring Emma back. Despite that he liked Emma, Beast disapproved of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> kissing Emma at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jean-grey/29-3552/\">Jean Grey's</a> grave, although Cyclops argued back that it would be hypocritical to not follow his feelings. What neither Beast nor Cyclops knew was that Jean had telepathically given Cyclops encouragement to express his romantic feelings for Emma, so that he would not be in pain.</p><h3><b>Astonishing X-Men</b></h3><p>Cyclops formed a new X-Men, and Beast was drafted onto the team along with other X-Men/Women like Wolverine and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a>. On their first mission, the team dealt with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ord/29-4445/\">Ord</a> of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/breakworld/34-42278/\">Breakworld</a> and the \"cure\" for mutants. After a brief encounter with Ord, Beast went to visit his old friend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-kavita-rao/29-4446/\">Dr. Kavita Rao</a> to get a sample of the \"cure\". He takes it back to the Institute, and begins to study it. Wolverine then comes to his lab, telling Beast that Emma told him that his mind was basically screaming it out that he wanted to take the cure. Wolverine tells him to flush it but Beast refuses to do so, and the two fight it out, until Emma stops them telepathically and threatens to make them tango. When he finds out that Rao had been testing the cure on corpses of other mutants, he helps stop her and Ord, and he and the X-Men destroy the base.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1074360\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074360-464984_astonishing_x_men_by_bianchi_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Astonishing X-Men\"><img id=\"1074360\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1074360-464984_astonishing_x_men_by_bianchi_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Astonishing X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Astonishing X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>After a confrontation with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger/29-40862/\">Danger</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cassandra-nova/29-11317/\">Cassandra Nova</a> psionically attacks the team. She strips Beast of all his morality, intellect and basically his mind, leaving him as basically, a feral beast. He attacked Wolverine and bit off some flesh on his leg (obviously it grew back). Luckily, the student <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blindfold/29-40597/\">Blindfold</a> used a \"sensory stimulant\", something the Professor and Beast invented, just in case of a situation like this. The stimulant was in a form of a ball of string. Beast then used a special magnet he'd created to stop Danger and Ord. The X-Men, Ord and Danger are teleported away to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sword/65-41666/\">SWORD</a>, and travel to the Breakworld. Beast is one of the X-Men taken with them. Later, he and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abigail-brand/29-4441/\">Abigail Brand</a> are separated from the main squad, and almost freeze to death but Agent Brand manages to save them by generating heat to keep them warm (no one knows how she did this yet).</p><p>She later dives in front of a laser to save him, believing that he is the one with the best chance to save Earth. He gets to the missile along with some of the others. Danger finds a signature on the missile of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magik/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> and as they talk, the missile, with Kitty inside, is fired. Beast then realizes that it's not a missile, but a bullet. As Beast team doubles back to their ship he finds Agent Brand who survived the laser blast and they pick up their antagonistic banter with each other. When Beast accuses Brand of still keeping things from him and after he persisted she admits that she is really attracted to him.</p><p>Once back on Earth Brand takes a walk with Henry and waits for his response on the job with SWORD that she has offered him, as she believes him to be qualified both professionally and personally and states as much. Beast is later shown with Brand and several X-students in a lab both him and Brand looking pleased.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/endangered-species/39-43950/\"><b>Endangered Species</b></a></h3><p>Since the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a> Beast has tirelessly tried to reverse their effects and avoid mutant extinction. Dr. McCoy sought the help of some of the Marvel U's most brilliant scientist and heroes in order to find a solution. Making little progress, Beast then extended his plea for help to some of the most intelligent and ruthless villains such as Mr. Sinister, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a>.

In <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men-divided-we-stand/49-21203/\">X-Men: Divided We Stand</a> Beast was dropped off at the Xavier institute by Logan. Beast spent his time in the subbasement destroying all the student and teacher files fearing what would happen if they fell into the wrong hands. He then emailed the information for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stryfe/29-7616/\">Stryfe's</a> Legacy Virus to five scientist he trusted thinking that no matter what happens to him, the anti-virus would always be safe. Beast then took <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/no-girl/29-41121/\">Martha Johansson</a> and left the institute putting a No Admittance sign on the gates.</p><p>After <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah CompleX</a>, Beast relocated to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a> with the rest of the X-Men. His primary job in San Francisco was first to set up the Greymalkin Facility with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prodigy/29-40475/\">Prodigy</a>, and build all the X-Men's needed computer equipment. This included <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cerebra/29-41318/\">Cerebra</a>, security systems, a new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger-room/34-41918/\">Danger Room</a>, and much more. Afterwards Beast formed a science team along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a>. This science team, known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-club/65-56306/\">X-Club</a>, was working to reverse M Day by any means.

While in the past, the X-Club encounter an earlier version of the Sentinel made by the Hellfire of the 1906 and had also accidentally caused the San Francisco earthquake. Unfortunately, when the X-Club returned to the past, the DNA evidence had been buried beneath the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dreaming-celestial/29-22836/\">Dreaming Celestial</a> in the park.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopia/39-55905/\"><b>Utopia</b></a></h3><p>After raising <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asteroid-m/34-41752/\">Asteroid M</a> and naming it <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopia/34-56536/\">Utopia</a> where mutants can live peacefully, Beast started to have doubts on whether or not to stay with the X-Men. Beast has shown to be disillusioned about Cyclops's leadership, allowing Magneto to join the X-Men and taking so long to save him from Dark Beast's torture.

When Kid Gladiator shrinks down and jumps inside Kitty to save her, Beast goes in after him. Beast leads the students against the hoard of Brood inside of Kitty while trying to find Kid Gladiator who has turned into a Brood. Hank plants a localized bomb after recovering Kid Gladiator and exits along with the students. Once out Hank finds Broo covered in <a href=\"/professor-xanto-starblood/29-83029/\">Dr. Starblood</a>'s blood, who was behind all of this in an attempt to kill Broo.

In his human form, Beast could lift 1 ton. His simian form could lift 10 tons. His feline form can lift at least 25 tons. He has strong fingers and toes, using his razor sharp claws on his hands and his feet to scale walls. He has thick blue fur all over his body. Hank has great manual and pedal dexterity and can perform several complicated tasks using both his hands and feet such as tying knots with his feet. He has long appendages that allow to him to walk on all fours. Beast has superhuman durability, though he is very far from invulnerable. He can survive a fall from 3 stories if he lands on his feet and being struck by superhuman strong foes that would kill an average human. Beast can run for short sprints at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. He has enhanced senses such as night-vision and a sense of smell that can track a human and also has a slight healing factor. This healing factor allows him to recover from slight sicknesses like colds quickly. He also heals broken bones in a couple days, where it takes regular people weeks, even months. Furthermore, in contrast to his superhuman powers, he is extremely intelligent. He is one of the smartest people in the Marvel Universe. He is a leading geneticist.</p><p>Later on, when he has taken on a secondary mutation, his smelling, strength, sight and reflexes are enhanced even further. The secondary mutation gave him the a feline appearance. The downside to this mutation is that Hank has lost his super human dexterity. He has stated that he used to play the guitar but now plays the drums as a result of the lost dexterity. Beast is a capable hand to hand combatant. He has been trained by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Xavier</a>, in a fighting style that makes good use of his agility, strength and speed.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-295 (Age Of Apocalypse)</h3><p>In this reality, Beast was a twisted and sadistic scientist known as the Dark Beast.</p><p>For more information on this character see the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-beast/29-3422/\">Dark Beast</a> page.</p><h3><b>Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe)</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1092382\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5078/1092382-ubeast.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1092382\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5078/1092382-ubeast_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>In the Ultimate universe Beast was an X-Man who at first appeared to be a human with ape-like proportions, strength and agility.

He had an on-and-off relationship with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, which he broke off because he could not believe she loved him without the Professor mind-controlling her to.

Instead of reversing the mutation, as was his intent, McCoy caused himself to undergo a complete physical metamorphosis. Now, McCoy was a literal beast--a green-skinned, amphibious monster. The most tragic aspect of the entire affair was that his once-superior intellect was virtually gone, and with it, all hope for reversing the transformation. He joined his former teammates in the Six but during the inferno he was duped by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sym/29-10291/\">Sym</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nastirh/29-42869/\">N'astirh</a> and allied with them.

He hadn't left the X-Mansion since the explosion, which in turn shows his dedication to Xavier's cause.</p><h3><b><u>Film</u></b></h3><h4><b>X-Men</b></h4><p>Beast was supposed to appear in this film, but due to make-up problems his part was removed. His role as the doctor for the team was instead given to Jean Grey.</p><h4>X2: X-Men United</h4><p>He is seen on a television screen in a bar here, in his original fur-less appearance. Although his appearance was merely a cameo, the character was largely recognized as Beast. In a deleted scene of the movie, Beast is shown to be affected by dark Cerebro and takes on his furred appearance when he is psychically attacked by the machine. He was played by Steve Bacic.</p><h4>X-Men: The Last Stand</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"99451\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1093/99451-46760-beast.jpg\" title=\"Kelsey Grammer as Beast\"><img id=\"99451\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1093/99451-46760-beast_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Kelsey Grammer as Beast\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kelsey Grammer as Beast</div></div></div></div><p>He has a main role in this film, and fights along side the X-Men when fighting off Magneto's Brotherhood. He is described as being one of the earlier X-Men, but left to become involved in politics for the good of mutant kind. Beast is the one who injects Magneto with the mutant cure. Here he was played by Kelsey Grammer.</p><h4>X-Men: First Class</h4><p>Henry McCoy was a scientist, who worked for the CIA. Upon meeting him, Charles Xavier instantaneously knew that Hank was a Mutant. Also, Hank McCoy introduced Xavier to the stealth jet, that he had designed. McCoy creates a Mutant-locating device called Cerebro. Xavier was the only, who could use Cerebro, because it required his special Mutant abilities. Beast is constantly annoyed and harassed throughout the movie, by fellow Mutant Havok. Havok steadily agitates Beast, about his large and animal-like feet. He goes to such extremes as calling McCoy names, such as \"Big Foot.\"</p><p>In First Class, Beast and Mystique have instant chemistry upon meeting each other. They both share a common understanding for one another. Beast and Mystique want to be accepted into society, and be considered \"normal.\" Beast devotes his time to create a cure for both himself and Mystique. Beast's cure would be made, only to alter his appearance, but not affect his Mutant powers whatsoever. However, Magneto reassures Mystique, that she is perfect the way she is. Mystique eventually takes Magneto's words to heart, and refuses to take the cure. Henry McCoy, however, takes his cure, which actually backfires.</p><p>Beast's cure makes him grow blue hair, and makes him resemble some type of animal. Beast is accredited with making the New Mutant's uniforms. After, Beast's cure backfires he becomes very self-conscious about his appearance. However, after some motivation from Mystique, Beast accepts who he has become, and agrees to fly the New Mutants in his stealth jet. Also, Havok, complimented Beast's new appearance. Havok declared that McCoy looked \"like a beast.\" In the last battle, where the New Mutants fight Sebastian Shaw and company, Beast plays a vital role. Beast, along with Havok are sent by Xavier to ward off Sebastian Shaw's right hand man, Azazel. He uses his specific Mutant ability, teleportation, to drop Havok on an enemy base. This action left Beast to handle Azazel alone. After much back and forth, Beast gets the upper hand and knocks out Azazel. In the end, Beast is one of the Mutants, that remains loyal to Charles Xavier, despite his weakened condition. He will be played by Nicholas Hoult.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><h4><b>X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse</b></h4><p>He is one of the five playable characters in this SNES game.

The first time Dani's powers manifested, she saw the image of her parents dying. She saw a huge bear standing over the bodies of a horse and an eagle; representing her mother came (from the horse clan) and her father (of the eagle clan). Shortly thereafter, her parents took a trip into the mountains and they disappeared, presumed to be dead.</p><p>Prior to her parents disappearance Dani was sent to live with some neighbors, but she did not have control over her mutant ability to create illusions based on primal fears or deepest desires resulting in much resentment toward her in the community. To escape the malice of her community she went to live with her Grandfather, Black Eagle, a recluse in the mountains.</p><p>Black Eagle was an old friend of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a> and contacted him to help his granddaughter upon learning of her mutant abilities. He told Dani of Xavier and his wish for her to go and study with him at his school. However, the news angered her. She did not wish to be being sent away with a \"white\", and accidentally lashed out with her power creating an image of her grandfather's death. Before Xavier could arrive, Black Eagle was killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">Donald Pierce's</a> henchmen from the Hellfire Club.</p><p>In her ensuing quest for vengeance, Dani freed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">X'ian Coy Mahn</a> from Pierce's imprisonment, and encountered Xavier and the other young mutants whom Pierce would threaten with his genocidal anti-mutant agenda. After Pierce was defeated Dani stayed with Xavier to honor her grandfather's wishes. At first she took the codename Psyche, but shortly thereafter became better known as Mirage, and she soon came to see the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a> as not only close friends but her family.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Danielle was created by <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a> and <a href=\"/bob-mcleod/26-4322/\">Bob McLeod</a> and appeared first in <a href=\"/marvel-graphic-novel/49-3144/\">Marvel Graphic Novel</a> #4 in 1982.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Demon Bear</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"290660\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/290660-120675-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Skilled Archer\"><img id=\"290660\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/290660-120675-moonstar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Skilled Archer\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Skilled Archer</div></div></div></div><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon-bear/29-15552/\">Demon Bear</a> who had claimed her parents came for her, Dani went out to face it. It mauled her severely, nearly killing her. She would have been paralyzed had it not been for the lifesaving powers of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morlocks/65-3191/\">Morlock's</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/healer/29-13365/\">Healer</a>. The New Mutants fought the Bear on a magical plane, defeating it and freeing Dani\u2019s parents from its clutches.</p><h3>Asgard</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"185530\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/185530-108894-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Valkyrie\"><img id=\"185530\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/185530-108894-moonstar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Valkyrie\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Valkyrie</div></div></div></div><p>In one adventure, the New Mutants and the X-Man <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> were kidnapped by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/enchantress/29-7225/\">Enchantress</a> of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a>\u2019s request. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Illyana Rasputin</a> attempted to teleport them all away, the New Mutants found themselves scattered through Asgard. Dani found herself in a grassy plain where she spotted a fully white, winged horse that had been trapped by hunters and began to attempt to free it. While trying to set the winged horse free, an army began to charge at her. Unwilling to leave the horse helpless and not willing to run, Dani chose to fight back, which led her to using her telepathic abilities to draw forth the image that the oncoming warriors feared most, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hela/29-4342/\">Hela</a> Asgardian Goddess of Death. The enemies froze in fear and left immediately, without a backwards glance. Dani not recognizing who the image was, cared less and returned to the winged-horse and freed it. The horse instantly began to trust and bonded with Dani. The horse was one of the winged-steeds of the Valkyor who had chosen her to be a Valkyrie; one of the choosers of the slain. It is possible that Dani\u2019s moments of seeing her parents and grandfather\u2019s deaths may have indicated a previously existing mystical ability in this area. The New Mutants joined forces with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> to defeat Loki. The steed, which Dani named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brightwind/29-28987/\">Brightwind</a> returned to Earth with her. Upon her connection with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brightwind/29-28987/\">Brightwind</a> Dani was very different though, in powers as well as responsibilities. Dani was no longer just a human mutant but a Valkyrie. This title gifted her with the ability to \"see\" death, or an aura of death around individuals who were to die soon. This gift also allowed Dani the ability to fight Death itself. On a couple of occasions, Dani attempted to fight Death to save the lives of those around her, though she was not always successful and learned that Death was a natural process of life not always to be feared.</p><h3>Leaving the New Mutants</h3><p>Later, when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hela/29-4342/\">Hela</a> attempted to take over Asgard, Dani found herself trapped under the sway of Hela along with the rest of the Valkyor. She attempted to kill <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/odin/29-3507/\">Odin</a>, but the New Mutants combined with the Asgardians defeated Hela\u2019s forces, freeing the Valkyor and Dani. Dani then chose to remain behind in Asgard to help repair the damage she had done.</p><h3>Return To Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"185343\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/185343-169557-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Mutant Liberation Front\"><img id=\"185343\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/185343-169557-moonstar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mutant Liberation Front\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mutant Liberation Front</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually, Dani returned to earth and unbeknownst to any of her friends she joined <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a>. As a SHIELD operative, she took on a mission to go undercover in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-liberation-front/65-28349/\">Mutant Liberation Front</a> (MLF), using the code name Moonstar. Purposefully withholding information of her recent past, she would use her powers against her old team-mates, while serving as an informant for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a>. Dani was forced to take on a harder, darker persona, almost changing herself completely, including her mutant powers. Dani was able to refine her psychic abilities to the point were she focus he mental energies to create \"Psychic Arrows.\" These same \"arrows\" once connected with there intended target would incapacitate them, by either knocking them unconscious, temporarily paralysing or befuddle them and they would begin to make incoherent noise; completely taking the out of a fight. Not only did Dani take on a darker appearance in mind and body, but it also changed Brightwind. No longer bright at all, her Pegasus was not white, but completely black and now call Darkwind.</p><p>While apart of the MLF Dani struggled with her \"undercover status\" as it put her at odds with herself. An unfortunate side affect to her \"deep cover\" was that it brought her into many conflicts with old allies <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> which was largely comprised of former <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>. Additionally she began to get to know the members of the MLF a lot better, resulting in a genuine friendship with the mutant named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forearm/29-13315/\">Forearm</a>. Her job became more of a struggle as she began to feel guilt by her actions, and as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/reignfire/29-15520/\">Reignfire</a>, the MLF's leader, began to suspect her loyalties. After the MLF and X-Force battled <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/operation-zero-tolerance/39-43899/\">Operation: Zero Tolerance</a>, Dani left SHIELD (and therefore the MLF too) to rejoin her friends in X-force.</p><h3>Return To X-Force</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"346248\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/346248-67583-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Quantum Powers\"><img id=\"346248\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/346248-67583-moonstar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Quantum Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Quantum Powers</div></div></div></div><p>During the team\u2019s encounter with operatives of the Damocles Foundation, Dani was accidentally transmorphed into a crystal like state by the reality warping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arcadia/29-15553/\">Arcadia DeVille</a>, who had no real control over her abilities. A few minutes later, Moonstar reverted back to flesh and blood, and it seemed that nothing had changed. X-Force and Arcadia parted ways, unaware of the side effects that this incident would cause.</p><p>Over the next days and weeks, Moonstar discovered that her body had been altered on a molecular level and that she possessed a new power. She could now channel the quantum energies that make up the universe, which allowed her to affect matter at a subatomic level. Actually learning-by-doing, Dani found a way to perceive these quantum energies as interconnected particles and waves. She found she could affect those connections, changing the physical nature of all things, including an electromagnetic field such as the one generated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> during X-Force\u2019s encounter with him in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>. It was not only Moonstar who had been changed, but Arcadia too. Their brief encounter had created some sort of link between the two women and they began to access each other\u2019s memories and nightmares.</p><p>Haunted by visions of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/demon-bear/29-15552/\">Demon Bear</a>, Arcadia accidentally provided this monstrosity with a new physical form and chaos ensued in San Francisco. Moonstar and DeVille were both consumed by the Bear, who wanted to add their powers to his own. However, from within, the two women tried to re-absorb the energies that had been used in his creation. Evidently it worked, as the Bear was destroyed, but Arcadia could not handle the increased power level and retreated deep within her own mind. She transformed herself into the Queen of the Star Swords, an evil character from one of her childhood tales. Perceiving Moonstar as a potential threat, she split her apart with four different Moonstars appearing, each representing different aspect of Dani - New Mutant, Valkyrie, M.L.F., and quantum-powered, while the real Moonstar was left a powerless husk.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"78322\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/435/78322-46483-moonstar_super.gif\" title=\"With the X-Men\"><img id=\"78322\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/435/78322-46483-moonstar_thumb.gif\" alt=\"With the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">With the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Out of thin air, the Queen created a cathedral in a dimensional rift as her headquarters and, venturing inside, X-Force became lost in different alternate timelines. Eventually, they could track down the Moonstar-fragments and Dani was reunited. Using her abilities in combination, Moonstar ended the threat of the Queen / Arcadia, as she channeled the entire might of her quantum-based powers into a psionic arrow, which sealed the rift and returned Arcadia to normal. Their link severed, Dani no longer could access the quantum energies and was back to her psionic arrows and emotional illusion casting.</p><p>Later some members of X-Force decided to get the British black op <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pete-wisdom/29-14819/\">Pete Wisdom</a> to train them and improve their effectiveness. However, Moonstar, like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/domino/29-2161/\">Domino</a>, could not agree with his methods and quit the team. Instead, she joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> on a part-time basis, whilst she attended college classes in her spare time. Dani rarely went on any missions, but mostly functioned as mansion staff along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a>.</p><h3>Teacher</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"136835\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/136835-128328-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Teacher\"><img id=\"136835\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4226/136835-128328-moonstar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Teacher\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Teacher</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually, Dani returned to her home in Colorado. She became involved with Xavier\u2019s school again when she learned of the plight of a young mutant in nearby Denver. Young <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sofia-mantega/29-40537/\">Sofia Mantega</a> had been sent to her father, who didn\u2019t want her. After being ignored by her father and ridiculed by her fellow students for months, she snapped and used her mutant powers to control the wind to cause havoc at one of her father\u2019s supermarkets. Her father was willing to leave her in jail but Dani interceded and got him to agree that she could take Sofia to Xavier\u2019s school.</p><p>Seeing Dani\u2019s good instincts with Sofia and a fellow student, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wallflower/29-40535/\">Laurie Collins</a>, Xavier suggested Dani become a teacher at the institute. Dani was unwilling at first and instead Xavier asked her to contact several mutants located by Cerebra in his name. Dani recruited two more kids and was reunited with fellow former New Mutant, Xi\u2019an Coy Manh, along the way. Dani joined the X-Men as an affiliate member, recruiting and teaching/ training students at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute/65-40473/\">Xavier Institute</a>, even becoming a guardian for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elixir/29-4552/\">Elixir</a> when his parents completely rejected him. She eventually took over the training of the New Mutant Squad. There she re-united with Rahne.</p><p>When Xavier left the school, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> became co-headmistress together with her lover, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Scott Summers</a>. Remembering her only to well from her villain days as the Hellfire Club\u2019s White Queen, Dani didn\u2019t get along with Emma and, before long, their feud carried over to the two training squads tutored by them, the New Mutants and the Hellions. Even worse, when Dani wanted to bring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wither/29-40511/\">Kevin Ford</a> back to the school, she needed Emma\u2019s help to operate Cerebra and pinpoint his location. It was Emma who convinced the boy to return but, only a few days later, the FBI wanted to arrest him for apparently killing his own father. At first, Dani was against turning him over to the authorities but eventually was convinced otherwise. Surprisingly, the court declared the death of Kevin\u2019s father and accident and he was allowed to return to Xavier\u2019s, though the damage was done. He no longer trusted Danielle one bit and asked to be transferred to Emma\u2019s squad. The incident still had a pleasant side-effect for Danielle, as she became romantically involved with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justin-pierce/29-11913/\">Justin Pierce</a>, the FBI agent assigned to the case.</p><h3>M-Day</h3><p>Dani was one of the many Mutants whose powers were removed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/decimation/39-43626/\">Decimation</a>. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> made Dani leave the school along with all the other mutants who had been de-powered. Dani took the loss of her powers pretty hard, but she participated in an interview with reporter <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sally-floyd/29-40659/\">Sally Floyd</a>, who was writing down the stories of the de-powered mutants. Later, Dani was working with the Government as part of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-initiative/65-42781/\">The Initiative</a> to train young people with super-powers, though sometimes her wishes run counter to her supervisors. She became the primary instructor for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trauma/29-42788/\">Trauma</a>, who has similar emotion/fear-based powers that she had previously had. At first, Trauma didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with her, but Danielle pretty soon convinced him that he could benefit from her training. However she was been fired by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Gyrich</a> for teaching Trauma liberal, anti-militaristic beliefs.</p><h3>Re-Union</h3><p>In the wake of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/messiah-complex/39-48995/\">Messiah Complex</a>, there X-Men disbanded and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> closed the Xavier Institute. Shortly After he seeks out six former students and recruits them as the last team of X-Men ever. Once gathered together at their headquarters he explains that their enemy is a new incarnation of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil</a>. He displays a hologram of the new Botherhood's members, including five of the original New Mutants; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cannonball/29-1496/\">Cannonball</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">Sunspot</a> and Danielle Moonstar. Cyclops explicitly stated that the new team's orders were to kill their predecessors. However, after the confrontation between old and new New Mutants, it was revealed that Donald Pierce had deceived the new team and sent them to destroy the original New Mutants. After his defeat, Cyclops asked Dani and Sunspot to help train the Young X-Men.</p><h3>Back With The New Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"767057\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/767057-newmutv3003_cov_col_super.jpg\" title=\"Rejoining the New Mutants\"><img id=\"767057\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/767057-newmutv3003_cov_col_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Rejoining the New Mutants\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rejoining the New Mutants</div></div></div></div><p>Some time after the X-Men had set up the Graymalkin Institute in San Francisco, thanks to a warning by Illyana, both Dani and Xian were discovered to have gone to a town in Colorado to seek out a possible mutant problem. When Illyana, Amara, Sam and Bobby investigate, they find out that the mutant is really Legion. Xian is found to be in a comatose state after having gone into Legion's mind, and Dani is found imprisoned in a local jail.</p><p>As one of the beings who previously tried to \"fix\" David Haller's mind, Dani becomes the target of Legion. When Sam and Bobby knock Legion away from Dani's cell, Sam leaves her inside, thinking that she was safer inside than exposed to Legion if she were free. Sam realizes his mistake when Legion uses another of his powers to manipulate the earth in Dani's cell in a second attempt to kill her. That attempt is stopped when Magma melts the earth golem Legion created. Furious at Sam, Dani punches him, then arms herself with various weapons in order to be useful when they bring the fight back to the insane mutant.</p><p>Despite her efforts, Sam still tries to get her to escape by commandeering a vehicle for her. Furious, Dani drives away. Cannonball, Magma and Sunspot then attempt to fight Legion while Illyana tries to salvage the situation from within Legion's own mind. One by one, Legion takes down the three mutants using the different abilities of his hostile personalities. When Legion finally shifts to a werewolf-like form to regenerate his wounds and finish off a helpless Cannonball, Dani returns in time to ram Legion with her vehicle and prevent Sam from being killed. Despite ramming Legion into a wall and stabbing him with her knife, the omega level mutant still gains the upper hand. Before he can kill Dani, Illyana succeeds in freeing Shan and David Haller's base personality from within Legion's mind, and ending the ordeal. Later, as the rest of the X-Men arrive for cleanup and recovery, Dani is seen to angrily spurn Sam's attempts at an apology.</p><h3>Valkyrie Again</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"930367\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/930367-hela_super.jpg\" title=\"Requesting Hela's aid\"><img id=\"930367\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/930367-hela_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Requesting Hela's aid\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Requesting Hela's aid</div></div></div></div><p>During Utopia, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> sends Dani to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/las-vegas/34-55734/\">Las Vegas</a>, there she approaches the Norse goddess of death, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hela/29-4342/\">Hela</a> for a 'boon'. Hela warns her that the price of the 'boon' is a heavy one, but Dani accepts, requesting \"a ride home and a big ol' sword\". It is presumed that Dani has asked for her Valkyrie powers back. During the battle against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a> on the new mutant haven, Utopia, the invulnerable God <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ares/29-11940/\">Ares</a> arrives closely followed by Dani returning as a Valkyrie to stop him.</p><p>Dani easily overcomes Ares and brings him down to his knees. Ares states that he was not prepared to battle a Valkyrie. Danielle Moonstar alongside her fellow New Mutants (Illyana, Cannonball, Karma, etc.) pose ready to battle. Dani states that she is not just a Valkyrie but \"was made to stop gods.\" With Ares badly wounded, and with the entire mutant populace ganging up on him, Osborn abandons his efforts, leaving the mutant island.</p><h3>Siege</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1173980\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/61766/1173980-new_mutants_11_0008_super.jpg\" title=\"Valkyrie in the Siege\"><img id=\"1173980\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/61766/1173980-new_mutants_11_0008_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Valkyrie in the Siege\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Valkyrie in the Siege</div></div></div></div><p>The New Mutants are spending a weekend in Las Vegas, as Hela is calling in the favor Dani Moonstar owes her. She empowers Dani as her own Valkyrie and explains that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a> (currently on Earth) is under Siege and Dani\u2019s job is to escort the souls of the dead gods to her. Dani is reluctant, fearing Hela is planning some awful scheme. When she reaches Asgard, she quickly finds the Asgardian souls, led by the war god <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tyr/29-25894/\">Tyr</a>. But when the Valkyries ask her to join them fighting, she tells the souls to wait for her as nothing bad can happen to them anymore. However, when she is gone, horrible soul-eating monsters, the D\u2019siri, attack and devour several of the souls, despite Tyr\u2019s attempt to protect them. When she realizes what is happening, Dani returns and chases away the D\u2019siri, but too late for some of the souls. She tells Tyr that he is wounded but still alive and has him rejoin the living. She then brings the remaining souls to Hela, ashamed that she was wrong and Hela was actually trying to save them.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1231467\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/53216/1231467-nm13_hope4_super.jpg\" title=\"Hope punches Dani\"><img id=\"1231467\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/53216/1231467-nm13_hope4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hope punches Dani\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hope punches Dani</div></div></div></div><p>During <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/second-coming/39-55971/\">Second Coming</a>, Cyclops sanctions Dani and the New Mutants (minus Illyana) in a holding pattern over the Midwest aboard the Blackbird. He then sends them to St. Louis to shut down <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cameron-hodge/29-13379/\">Cameron Hodge</a>'s facility where he's producing Anti-Mutant weaponry. They are ordered not to let Hodge send his team to help the Purifiers. The team engage the soldiers in battle. Dani takes part in the battle, regardless of being powerless, using her fighting abilities to engage the soldiers in battle. The team are forced to retreat after Karma's leg is mutilated by Hodge, while Warlock kills him and his forces with his powers. Back on the plane Dani tries to help Karma with her wound. After they return, Dani attends <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a>'s funeral. At the mess hall, Moonstar confronts Cable, telling him that her team took it rough covering for him and wonders if his new 'hobby' is worth it. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hope-summers/29-49329/\">Hope</a> takes it personally, and she punches Dani in the face. Both end up fighting. Cyclops orders them to break it up, however Cable thinks Scott should stop keeping Hope in a bubble, as she makes her own way now. Later, during a meeting, Cyclops assigns Cypher to join <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-force/65-15595/\">X-Force</a> on their mission to the future. Wolverine replies by commenting on Doug's 'one weakness', \"bullets\". Moonstar reacts angrily, calling him a \"son of a bitch\" getting up ready to attack him, but she's stopped by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a>. Dani then joins the fight on the Golden Gate Bridge and witnesses Hope defeating Bastion and her possession of the Phoenix. After the fight is over, Moonstar attends her former mentor, Cable's, funeral.</p><h3>Fall Of The New Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1319237\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1319237-drunkkk_super.png\" title=\"Sam and Dani kiss\"><img id=\"1319237\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1319237-drunkkk_thumb.png\" alt=\"Sam and Dani kiss\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sam and Dani kiss</div></div></div></div><p>After Second Coming, Sam decides to take the team out for some R R. The team drink a lot, and they slowly start going over what happened during Second Coming. Then they start swapping funny stories with Dani recounting what happened during the battle with Hodge. During this time, Dani and Sam become extremely drunk and start flirting which leads to them kissing. They are interrupted by Illyana who senses an upcoming danger through her Soulsword and that <a href=\"/pixie/29-40673/\">Pixie</a> has been kidnapped. This leads the team to fight <a href=\"/project-purgatory/65-57819/\">Project Purgatory</a> and the <a href=\"/inferno-babies/65-57906/\">'Inferno babies</a>', the very same children they helped save years ago during Inferno. The two groups fight, but the other side proves brutal. Dani fights <a href=\"/loca/29-75081/\">Loca</a> but the other woman easily evades her, smelling her emotions, saying that her lack of powers is causing her to be afraid. Dani tries to hit Loca, but instead the other woman hits her with one of her demonic limbs. She grabs Dani\u2019s right arm, announcing she is going to hurt her now and taste her pain. She orders her too look at her, Dani does and manages not to scream when Loca breaks her arm. Good girl, Loca praises her, then knocks her out. The entire team is defeated and the babies state that they can do anything they want with the team.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1593282\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54403/1593282-dani_super.jpg\" title=\"Revenge\"><img id=\"1593282\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/54403/1593282-dani_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Revenge\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Revenge</div></div></div></div><p>The 'inferno babies' then begin to torture the team whilst taking control of Cypher. Sam and Dani's cells are next to each other, so Sam can hear Dani screaming from the excessive torture. <a href=\"/timothy/29-74996/\">Timothy</a> and a few of the soldiers are torturing her for their amusement. Timothy holds Dani by the throat, informing her that her arm is broken and she is in shock. When she tries to tough it out, he asks for the soul leeches. Sam shouts at them to leave her alone and <a href=\"/loca/29-75081/\">Loca</a>, who feeds off emotions, enjoys his suffering. Dani screams in agony as the torture continues. From the cell next to her, Sam shouts abuse at her torturers, swearing to kill them. Dani shouts at him to get it together. He\u2019s giving them what they want. She also says that he was right about Lila Cheney. He\u2019s an excellent kisser.\nShe screams again and Loca suddenly loses her smile as Sam no longer reacts to Dani\u2019s suffering. The team then begin to be transported underground to become sacrifices to the <a href=\"/elder-gods/65-52790/\">Elder Gods</a>. <a href=\"/maw/29-74992/\">Maw</a> and <a href=\"/trista/29-74594/\">Trista</a> make Cypher carry Dani. Cypher informs her that he is under their control, Dani begins to say it's similar to when Selene took control, he agrees, saying he has become a clich\u00e9.</p><p>Moonstar is continued to be tortured, however her cell was attacked by a demon horde. Dani positioned herself to make sure the demons cut her bindings, and drew her knife and began fighting. Elsewhere, Loca vowed that Dani would die next. She kicked in the door to her cell only to find dead demons. \"Look at her!\" Dani ordered from behind. Loca turned around to see Dani using her bow, pulling the string with one of her feet. \"Good girl\" she mocked and shot her torturer straight through the chest with her arrow. After this, the group re-unite and help defeat the babies, project purgatory and the Elder Gods, helping to finally restore Illyana's soul.</p><h3>Unfinished Business</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1810859\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1810859-xxxxxxxxx_super.png\" title=\"Leader\"><img id=\"1810859\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1810859-xxxxxxxxx_medium.png\" alt=\"Leader\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Leader</div></div></div></div><p>After the Limbo mission, the team, minus Ilyana, Sam and Karma, but plus Wolverine, Colossus and Kitty, head to defeat a horde of robots with left over Nimrod tech. During the mission, Wolverine notices how Dani acts like the leader, but her decisions are always right. The team easily defeat the robot, until they notice that everyone that was sent on the mission has a connection to Illyana. The team head back to Utopia, where Dani visits Karma and <a href=\"/face/29-74515/\">Face</a>. Dani tells Karma that Face is potentially very dangerous. She agrees but says that he needs her, like Sam needs Dani. She visits Sam in the psychiatric ward. Dani expresses her discomfort at visiting Sam at what appears like a jail. Moonstar tells him that he created the second generation and he should lead it, but Sam still feels he needs to heal. However, Dani feels that there is no team anymore and that she fears Cyclops is going to break them up and re-assign them. Sam states that it's Cyclops call, but that whatever happens from here, he still gets to to do this. A puzzled Dani wonders what until she's interrupted by Sam kissing her. She then says that he can and they continue to kiss. After this, Dani visits Cyclops. Where he tells her, to her surprise, that he's not dissolving the team, but rather making her the leader. He then tells her the team will now handle loose ends, to deal with unfinished business. And that their first mission is to find and bring Nate Grey, <a href=\"/x-man/29-15051/\">X-Man</a>, home.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Danielle Moonstar\u2019s principal ability was to pull images of great fear or desire from her victims and manifest them as three dimensional illusions. While she consciously used this ability, it does not allow her to scan a person\u2019s mind. Her only knowledge of what the image she conjures is when it has manifested in front of her. The illusion would appear as a holographic image to all who saw it except for the victim, who would think it was real.</p><p>In addition to this limited form of empathy, she also shared an empathic bond with animals. This allowed her to establish a telepathic connection with her former New Mutants teammate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>, while she was in her lupine form.</p><p>As a Valkyrie Dani had the ability to see, communicate with, and even fight Death itself. She already had some ability to see and manifest visions of her family members' deaths before she found Brightwind, but the gifts of the Valkyor greatly augmented this ability. However, it seems these abilities have disappeared. It remains unclear how this ability has subsided.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"835323\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35698/835323-danifeathers_super.jpg\" title=\"Mirage\"><img id=\"835323\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35698/835323-danifeathers_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mirage\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mirage</div></div></div></div><p>Over the course of her adventures, Dani\u2019s abilities have been temporarily augmented in one form or another. For a long time after encountering the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a>, she could manifest the images she pulled from others as tangible three dimensional projections, but she could only do that with one image at a time. If she created a car by wishing for it and then wanted to create a spear, then the car would disappear whenever she created the spear.</p><p>Since her return from Asgard Dani could fire psychic arrows that disrupted a person\u2019s neural pathways or forced them to relieve traumatic experience in their lives. For a very short time, her powers were mutated to allow her to control all quantum energies and interactions. Dani is also highly athletic and skilled hand to hand combatant.</p><p>She was de-powered after the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/m-day/12-41003/\">M-Day</a> .</p><p>She has since had her Valkyrie powers restored, after striking a deal with Mistress Hela. It is noticeable however, that her Hela-granted powers have a dark nature to them, with her winged steed being black, and her mystic sword glowing with a fiery energy. She has also declared that she is no longer simply a Valkyrie, and had the power to bring down gods. The extent of her present powers are as of yet unknown, though she was able to take down Ares, the Greek god of War with moderate effort.</p><h2>Statistics</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"712789\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/712789-71001_super.jpg\" title=\"Danielle Moonstar\"><img id=\"712789\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/712789-71001_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle Moonstar\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Danielle Moonstar</div></div></div></div><p><b>Known Relatives:</b> William Lonestar (father), Peg Lonestar (mother), Black Eagle (grandfather deceased).

In this reality there are two schooling options for young mutants to decide from: either the New Mutant Leadership Institute (similar to Xavier's Institute) for the future diplomats and leader's of the nation, or become a trainee of S.H.I.E.L.D. (joining their <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a> training squad) for a spy and covert ops/military type training. In the House of M, Danielle chose S.H.I.E.L.D. and is the field agent in charge of training the Hellions training squad, although an agent she actively participates in missions. Unlike in the regular 616 reality, Karma and Moonstar are not friends, and often bump heads as Karma is the leader of the New Mutants. She also appears to be without powers in this reality. Whether that's true or she doesn't use them is unknown.</p><h3>X-Men: The End (Earth #904)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"174149\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5599/174149-182547-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"Valkyrie\"><img id=\"174149\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5599/174149-182547-moonstar_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Valkyrie\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Valkyrie</div></div></div></div><p>In the X-Men: The End it chronicles the end of the X-Men 20 years in the future. In this reality, Danielle is capture and placed in a coma in a newly created Neverland Ranch located on the blue side of the moon. Whilst she is in a coma many of her friends in the X-Men whom she has known for years are killed, and she was unable to help. During an attack on Xavier Institute, Wolfsbane was caught in an explosion while attempting to save the lives of the students. In her last dying thoughts she called out to Dani for help. Through Dani's telepathic connection to Rahne while in her lupine form, Wolfsbane provided her with enough energy to try to break out of her coma. She began to chant spells and mystical runes manifested above &amp; around her body. The scientists on the moon were unnerved and decided to kill her. After her death Dani awoke as someone who was no longer a mutant or even a human being. Danielle Moonstar transformed into a Valkyrie, finally reaching her potential. She destroys Neverland Ranch as her final help to her allies on Earth, but then leaves Earth never to return. Thereafter, she later helped destroy Hela and took her place as the Norse Goddess of Death and ruler of Hel.</p><h3>Earth #8720 (New Mutants #48 &amp; 50)</h3><p>Most of the X-Men, if not all, and the New Mutants were killed by Sentinels in their initial attack. The New Mutants were reduced to a trio consisting of an aged Cannonball, his lover Lila Cheney and a very embittered &amp; war-torn Danielle Moonstar. They devised a plan to gather the remaining mutants together and use Lila's intergalactic teleportation powers to safely leave Earth and head to another planet. They appear to have been successful, as they are shown teleporting away in one of the final panels.</p><h3>Earth #1081</h3><p>Homeworld of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morph/29-12547/\">Morph</a>, ex-member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exiles/65-19986/\">Exiles</a>. The New Mutants of this reality were/are very similar to the mainstream counterpart of Earth #616 with an exception to the members of the team. The team consisted of Cannonball, Sunspot, Moonstar, Wolfsbane and Morph.</p><h3>Earth #904</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/what-if/49-4249/\">What If...</a> The X-Men Stayed In Asgard?</p><p>An offer is made to the X-Men and New Mutants giving them the choice of whether to stay or leave Asgard. Though only a few X-Men accept and stay, all but three of the New Mutants remain in Asgard effectively putting an end to the group as a whole. Those that remained in Asgard dramatically change history there and most take on important roles. Danielle Moonstar battles and defeats Hela the Goddess of Death and takes her role becoming the new Goddess of Death, ruling over her domain of Hel.</p><h3>Earth #?</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-mangaverse/12-46090/\">Marvel Mangaverse</a></p><p>In this reality Danielle Moonstar uses the codename Mirage and is a member of the X-Men. Her powers are quite different in this reality as she is a sorceress and has the ability to summon monsters that battle for her. One other significant difference from her mainstream counterpart is that here is from India and as such is not a Native American.</p><h2>T.V.</h2><h3>X-Men: Evolution</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"386746\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11768/386746-41146-moonstar_super.jpg\" title=\"X-men Evolution\"><img id=\"386746\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11768/386746-41146-moonstar_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"X-men Evolution\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-men Evolution</div></div></div></div><p>Danielle Moonstar was pertained as the Ghost of a Chance. When Shadowcat has an accident, she believes that she has survived uninjured by phasing and befriended a girl who introduced herself as Danielle. Danielle confessed that she is also a mutant and admires Kitty for the powers that she has. For this reason, she convinced her to join the Institute. Danielle had a hard time adjusting with other mutants. She also did not have control of her powers, causing her to traumatize everyone with fearful illusions even in their sleep.</p><p>As Kitty wakes up the next day, she looks for Danielle in the Institute but no one remembers her. Kitty blames Professor X, believing he must have deleted their memories but the reality is that no one named Danielle Moonstar has ever existed at the Institute. Kitty still believes that Dani was real and was not a part of her imagination. She asked assistance from Nightcrawler to teleport to Dani's hometown.</p><p>As Nightcrawler and Kitty explore the town, a mysterious call from a phone booth captures Kitty's attention and she answers it. It was Dani asking for help. With the help of a directory, she found Dani's address and followed it. There they met Black Eagle, who told them that Danielle had been missing for two years and was presumed dead. Nightcrawler believed that a Dani Moonstar existed but did not know how she met Kitty. Kitty did not lose hope and went to where she met Dani. Kitty heard and followed Dani's voice even without Kurt's permission. She phased under and saw Danielle unconscious.Kitty was surprised and happy to prove to herself that Dani was real. Kurt was worried, and asked help from the X-Men. The X-Men worked together to create a passageway for them to enter where Kitty had phased through. Meanwhile, Kitty awakened Danielle but she confessed that she can't phase out because it was too high for her. Kitty then heard the X-Men. Kurt teleported in and saved the two girls.</p><p>As the situation calms down, Dani is brought to the Institute. Professor X told everyone that Dani had projected herself into Kitty's dream while she was under recovery from the accident by using a ghost shaft. Black Eagle then came to bring Dani back home.</p><h2>Film</h2><h3>X-Men 2: X-Men United</h3><p>Her name appears on a list of names that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> scrolls through on Stryker's computer while looking for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>'s file.

His plan was to use Iceman's powers on the <a href=\"../../frost-giants/65-57102/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frost Giants</a> to fight Thor, for Bobby to reach the necessary power level he needed he was submitted to a machine that maximized his abilities to the point of no control. When he returned to the side of his teammates he couldn't control his ice powers, and <a href=\"../../leech/29-3193/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leech</a> was always used to cancel them.

Hank got in the way and received the kiss for him, it was here that he recovered his furry beastly form.</p><p>Bobby met <a href=\"../../opal-tanaka/29-11577/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Opal Tanaka</a> and soon began dating her, she was aware of his identity, so the relation evolved a little better than his previous ones, she was Japanese and was captured by the Yakusa clan and was forced to marry Hiro, Iceman followed her to <a href=\"../../japan/34-55746/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Japan</a> and challenged <a href=\"../../hiro/29-59041/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hiro</a>, he returned with Opal to the U.S.</p><p>After the <a href=\"../../muir-island-saga/39-55861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muir Island Saga</a>, Iceman rejoined the X-Men along with the rest of X-Factor.</p><h3>Returning to the X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76391\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76391-99458-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men's Gold Team\"><img id=\"76391\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76391-99458-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men's Gold Team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men's Gold Team</div></div></div></div><p>Leaving X-Factor to rejoined the X-Men, Iceman believed he had gained full control over his powers as he no longer required the use of his inhibitor belt.

They were soon attacked by the Yakuza clan again, Hiro sacrificed himself in order to save Opal and Iceman, their relation was never the same again after this. After weeks of not seeing each other she broke up with him. When he came across <a href=\"../../mikhail-rasputin/29-14830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mikhail Rasputin</a> he used his mutant abilities on him and it was at that moment when Iceman discovered that his potential was still a long way from perfection. He realized how to turn his whole body into ice, not just cover it, he could turn into new shapes and use his powers to a greater extent.</p><p>Iceman went to check on the comatose <a href=\"../../emma-frost/29-1457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emma Frost</a> (who was left in that state after a Sentinel attack) when she possessed his mind.

With Emma Frost in control of his body, Iceman managed to freeze a whole river and travel through the water.

His father also disapproved of him being with Rogue, because she was a mutant. Iceman had enough and left the house after telling his father that he should just accept the fact that he is a mutant and he would never fit the definition he has of normal. He was pretty upset about Emma being able to control his powers more than he ever could.</p><p>A short time after returning to the mansion, Iceman (along with Cyclops, Storm, and Wolverine) was kidnapped by <a href=\"../../post/29-15075/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Post</a> a servant of <a href=\"../../onslaught/29-13352/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onslaught</a>, who was testing them for his master. Post had shattered his chest, leaving him unable to return to his normal state. He contacted Emma Frost who had previously showed him his full potential. She telepathically made him fight his insecurities, so that he was able to refresh his body and turn back to normal.</p><p>During <a href=\"/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">Graydon Creed's</a> Presidential campaign Bobby was chosen to infiltrate and keep tabs on him. During one speech, Bobby's father stood out in a crowd and spoke in favor of the mutants, which surprised him, but made him proud at the same time. His father's connection with Bobby was discovered, so the people that worked for Graydon captured him and almost beat him up to death. Bobby took a leave of absense from the X-Men for a while to be with his dad.</p><p>During <a href=\"/operation-zero-tolerance/39-43899/\">Operation: Zero Tolerance</a>, Iceman found and helped a mutant surgeon named <a href=\"../../cecilia-reyes/29-14177/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cecilia Reyes</a> who was trying to keep her mutation a secret.

Later the both of them got on a plane and a bomb exploded in the plane, at that moment Opal revealed to really be Mystique, she shot him and threw him out of the plane. Then she followed him to the hospital and injected him with more neural inhibitor, this time enough to kill him, Bobby managed to find a way to use his powers to counter the effect of the toxins and he rose \"good as new\". He then confronted her again, were they exchanged a passionate conversation, Mystique cried and realized she actually did cared about Bobby and then threw herself off a bridge seemingly killing herself, Bobby realized what she meant with \"kill or cure\" and was grateful.</p><p>After he was settled in SF he helped in some of the big fights, like helping repelling the <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrulls</a> in the <a href=\"../../secret-invasion/39-47264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Invasion</a>, or fighting the <a href=\"../../mimic/29-12546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mimic</a> of Norman Osborn's <a href=\"../../dark-x-men/65-56445/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark X-Men</a>.</p><h3>Utopia/Nation X</h3><p>Since the X-Men moved to <a href=\"../../utopia/34-56536/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utopia</a>, Iceman had the labor of providing water to the population. He attempted to use humor to keep everyone's spirits up even though he believed that the situation was helpless and that the X-men were living in the last days of mutantkind. Bobby then helped defeat <a href=\"../../predator-x/29-47143/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Predator X</a> and also helped stop <a href=\"../../selene/29-2176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Selene's</a> resurrected army's invasion of Utopia.</p><h3>Second Coming</h3><p>When the <a href=\"../../nimrod/29-13314/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nimrods</a> attacked Utopia he received some serious burns, that passed through his ice form and forced him to turn back into his normal, human, state.

Iceman and Angel were sent to watch over the Light in Canada, <a href=\"../../laurie/29-72484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laurie</a>. The transformation into a mutant was a painful experience and Bobby couldn't stand to listen to the girl in such agony. It was when the girl was about to kill herself that Hope arrived and was able to fully activate her powers.</p><p>Bobby was sent to talk to a super hero public relations official. During the meeting she told him that she needed full disclosure of any of the X-Men secrets. Bobby hesitantly told her that Magneto was back and staying with the X-Men. The woman than asked it Worthington was funding them still, Bobby told her yes and asked why she wanted to know, she said because she was going to have a lot of overtime.</p><h3>Regenesis</h3><p>After the effects of Schism, Iceman was the first person asked by Wolverine to join the <a href=\"/jean-grey-school-for-higher-learning/34-57624/\">School</a> in Westchester. He officially is the bookkeeper of the School and teaches algebra and art of Ice Sculpture. During the first attack on the new school, Bobby stepped up like Logan wanted him to and became a big factor in defeating the Hellfire Club.</p><h2>Powers</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"281380\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13356/281380-41689-iceman_super.jpg\" title=\"The famous ice slide\"><img id=\"281380\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13356/281380-41689-iceman_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The famous ice slide\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The famous ice slide</div></div></div></div><p>Originally Iceman could lower the temperature of his body and encase himself in an icy armor of varying shape and consistency. He has since gained the ability to turn his entire body into a flexible form of organic ice. He can also freeze the moisture in the air and can create objects such as slides, ladders, and projectiles. He can reform any part of his body in his ice form, and can augment his shape and size. He has demonstrated the ability to animate ice forms by creating figures and through rapid freezing and unfreezing of their structure, and thus creating movement. These figures do not gain intelligence, and he is still in the developmental stage of this ability as it requires much concentration.</p><p>When in ice form he is generally translucent, and his appearance ranges from human-like to jagged and geometric. He is also known to add additional ice mass to his shoulders and knuckles (often jagged and sharp) for a fight. In addition to altering his appearance and shape, Bobby can also augment his size(an ability he has used to grow to heights of over 100 feet) A side effect of this alteration is superhuman strength to match his larger form.</p><p>With unexpected aid from Mystique (after she laced his blood with a potent concentration of chemicals) Bobby learned that by using his power to \"ice up\" and draw the moisture out of the air around him, he could turn himself into his own form of air filter, allowing him to let the poison molecules dissipate into vapor, effectively swapping his cells each time he released the ice and return to his flesh form or as he put it \"A body swap, done one piece, one cell at a time\".</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1647738\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/59196/1647738-x_men_160_18_super.jpg\" title=\"Growing in size and strength\"><img id=\"1647738\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/59196/1647738-x_men_160_18_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Growing in size and strength\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Growing in size and strength</div></div></div></div><p>If damaged, he can reform damaged or missing body parts. While physically and mentally taxing, this ability can be used to reform his entire body if necessary, as he has been able to reform himself to ice from sentient water vapor. This ability was taken even farther when he was under Emma Frost's control and he was able to turn himself into sentient liquid, travel in this form through a body of water, and return back to his organic ice form. He has not been able to replicate this ability, however it does suggest that with practice he could shift through any phase of water. For a time he was stuck permanently in ice form, however since M-Day has regained his ability to return to human form. Bobby also was at one time a Certified Public Accountant.</p><p>During the <a href=\"/curse-of-the-mutants/39-56136/\">Curse of the Mutants</a> story arc Iceman had himself blessed to make his ice into 'Holy water' to give him an advantage against the vampire attackers.</p><p>Iceman has demonstrated the ability to control chemical reactions involving heat exchange and can prevent people with fire based abilities from using their powers.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2376350\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117443/2376350-wolverine_xmen_11_art_preview_b.jpg\" title=\"Creating Multiple Ice Clones\"><img id=\"2376350\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117443/2376350-wolverine_xmen_11_art_preview_b_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Creating Multiple Ice Clones\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Creating Multiple Ice Clones</div></div></div></div><p>As with all the X-Men, Bobby has been trained in unarmed combat, tactics, and resisting mental attacks. During (and after) the \" <a href=\"../../age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Age of Apocalypse</a>\" storyline, it was revealed that Iceman's potential powers included the ability to, in essence, teleport via reverse-freezing molecules, meaning he theoretically can travel instantaneously across oceans when in full control of his abilities. However this method of teleportation has been described as extremely painful for anyone potentially traveling with Bobby.</p><p>During the run of Wolverine and the X-Men, Bobby demonstrated the abillity of creating multiple Ice clones. He is also able to control them but they are not self aware. This act tired him greatly afterwards. He managed to use the ice clones without tiring in a bout against the Red Hulk. However, they were in a snowy setting which may have contributed to Bobby not wearing down.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><p>Similar to energy manipulators as Magneto, Bobby Drakes mutant abilities are dependent on his physical condition. If he is extremely tired or has been mentally taxed his powers begin to become dysfunctional . Iceman is able to use his powers constantly for up to 5 hours before he taxes his powers to their limit and needs to rest. While in his human form Iceman still needs to eat,breathe, and sleep like normal human beings. His powers are also dependent on the level of moisture that is in his current vicinity. But while on Earth he has access to almost an unlimited amount even in a desert like area.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"85688\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/85688-85496-iceman_super.jpg\" title=\"Full Display of Bobby's Powers\"><img id=\"85688\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/85688-85496-iceman_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Full Display of Bobby's Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Full Display of Bobby's Powers</div></div></div></div><p><b>Gender:</b> Male</p><p><b>Height:</b> 5' 8\"</p><p><b>Weight</b>: 145 lbs.</p><p><b>Eyes</b>: Brown</p><p><b>Hair</b>: Brown</p><p><b>Status</b></p><p><b>Known Relatives</b>: William Robert Drake (father), Madeline Beatrice Bass Drake (mother), Mary (cousin), Joel (cousin), Anne (aunt)</p><p><b>Citizenship</b>: U.S.A.</p><p><b>Place of Birth</b>: Port Washington, Long Island, New York</p><p><b>Marital Status</b>: Single</p><p><b>Occupation</b>: Adventurer, formerly teacher, accountant, student</p><p><b>Education</b>: College degree, Certified Practicing Accountant accreditation</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-12</h3><p>In this reality, Iceman is still a member of the X-Men and is good friends with Mimic, a member of the Exiles.</p><h3>Earth-295: <a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"97175\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/97175-97475-iceman.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"97175\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/97175-97475-iceman_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>In the Age of Apocalypse, it was not Xavier but Magneto who founded and trained the X-Men, Bobby being among the first mutants he located. Magneto pushed the boy much harder than Xavier would have, making the youngster drop his humorous attitude and tap into his full potential. He is one of the main members of Rogue\u00b4s amazing X-Men. He is more savage killing people when needed. He remained loyal to Magneto\u00b4s team and hanged on for years in Erick\u00b4s dream, but a decade later of Apocalypse fallen a group of mutants of Earth 616 (Wolverine\u00b4s X-Force) arrived to Earth 295 trying to find the life seed in order to rescue Archangel from Apocalypse influence. During the Gateway\u00b4s rescue mission, Drake left the group and fleed. Later is revealed that Iceman was convinced by Archangel to serve to his cause and live in a paradise with the condition to kill the X-Force mercenaries. Drake was tired to fight for years and see how his most loved friends die so he accepted the deal and became part of mutants of AoA who travelled to Earth 616 in the new Age of Archangel. He battled Deadpool and managed to froze him and shattered him in thousands pieces. Using thousands of clones, he battled X-Force until Sunfire found his real body and incinerated it. Weakened, injured, but alive, Drake retreated along with Dark Beast and the rest of Archangel's forces.</p><p>Drake immersed himself in a life of hedonism in Madripor, believing himself to have deserved the chance to enjoy life. He was tracked down by his former friend Nightcrawler, Kurt Darkholme. Nightcrawler had chosen to remain in Earth 616 to take his revenge against the criminals and traitors who had escaped from the Age of Apocalypse, and had joined X-Force to help accomplish this mission. Nightcrawler, Wolverine, and Deadpool attacked an unsuspecting Drake. Drake's immense powers almost saved him until Nightcrawler teleported them both to inside a smelting plant. The intense heat kept Drake from using his powers. No powers, no weapons, the two former friends fought until Nightcrawler proved victorious. Nightcrawler threw a pleading Drake into a furnace, and watched as the Sinister Iceman burned to death.</p><p>Powers</p><p>Iceman could alter his shape while in his frozen form, and merge with any body of water, moisture or ice, and re-emerge from it at some other points even miles away, within the matter of seconds. When Bobby\u2019s ice-form was damaged or shattered, he could easily pull himself back together. On top of that, he was able to take people along by a process referred to as \"moisture molecular inversion\", but it was rather unpleasant for the passenger. However, as he seemed to become less human and more and more unstable, his teammates somewhat retreated from Bobby.His large and ridged form provided super strength. He has huge control over his powers making him invulnerable to Psychic attacks hidden his counciousness from telepathy, he is able to multiply his body and create several clones of him of variable sizes.</p><h3>Earth-311: <a href=\"/1602/39-41147/\">1602</a></h3><p>A time-traveling experiment gone wrong created another divergent timeline, one in which present day heroes already emerged in the 17th century, the year 1602 to be precise. Mutants were referred to as \u201cwitchbreed\u201d and, as such, feared and hunted. The counterpart of Iceman was called Robert Trefusis and, despite his young age, he showed a great control over his power. For example, he managed to encase an entire sailing ship in a block of ice and was able to turn rain into an ice-storm. Robert also claimed to have served as the cabin boy of the famous Sir Francis Drake, who happened to be his uncle.</p><h3>Earth-905</h3><p>In this reality, Iceman is a member of the Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants.</p><h3>Earth-1298: <a href=\"/mutant-x/49-6217/\">Mutant X</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"152040\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6179/152040-2991-iceman.jpg\" title=\"Earth-1298: Mutant X\"><img id=\"152040\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6179/152040-2991-iceman_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-1298: Mutant X\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-1298: Mutant X</div></div></div></div><p>In the Mutant X reality Iceman's powers were amplified by Loki and spun out of control.

Still, Bobby Drake, kept his optimism and his sense of humor, and he was part of a team called The Six, that world\u2019s equivalent to X-Factor, who had split off from the X-Men when the school was taken over by Magneto. Eventually, after having lived several years with boosted abilities, his friend and teammate Hank McCoy found a way to undo Loki\u2019s changes, and Ice-Man was restored to his regular power level.</p><h3>Earth-1610: <a href=\"/ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\">Ultimate</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"93551\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/93551-3230-iceman.jpg\" title=\"Ultimate Iceman\"><img id=\"93551\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/93551-3230-iceman_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate Iceman\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultimate Iceman</div></div></div></div><p>In the Ultimate Marvel continuity, Bobby Drake is the youngest founding member of the X-Men.

He was only able to be stopped by Rogue, who was in temporary possession of Marvel Girl's telepathy. Professor X has stated that Bobby is one of the three most powerful X-Men. During the World Tour arc, after enlarging his armor to form a gigantic ice troll, Bobby is greatly injured by Proteus, which resulted in a lawsuit issued by his parents against Xavier. Bobby eventually rebels against his parents, and later returns to the X-Men.

Upon her acceptance into the X-Men, Bobby begins to date Rogue. The pair date for a considerable amount of time, but eventually break up due to Bobby's growing feelings for Kitty Pryde and Rogue's feelings for Gambit. Eventually Rogue leaves, and Bobby starts to date Kitty until she dumps him after finding Bobby was still emailing Rogue. When Rogue returned to the X-Men, her original powers had been replaced with those of Gambit's and, now being able to touch each other, Bobby and Rogue rekindle their relationship.

Bishop, too, hinted to Bobby that he has a lot of potential, but Iceman shrugs off the acknowledgment.</p><p>It should also be noted that Bishop has made the hint that this version of Iceman has a different source for his freezing ability. In Ultimate X-Men #80 Bishop talks to Bobby about his potential and comments \"With minimal effort you are taking moisture out of the air and slowing water molecules down to make them cold. What else can you slow down?\" He also asks Bobby about exploring the possibilities with his powers.

The X-Men disbanded after the explosion at the Mansion, and young Bobby Drake returned to his parents' home. Although Beast had already located him earlier, it was Iceman's parents who refused to let their son have any contact with the X-Men.

However, Wolverine physically kicked the door down and asked Bobby directly \"are you comin'?\", to which he jumped at the chance and ran away from his parents. Wolverine's parting words to their Drakes was to \"deal with it\", referring to their son being a mutant in a time of great social unrest and distrust of mutants.</p><p>Since then Iceman has displayed many characteristic traits typical of a young male teen character. He's brash, energetic, hates studying and likes girls. When Emma Frost first enters the Mansion, Kitty embarrasses him by stating that Frost is a telepath &amp; therefore knows what he is thinking. There appears to be an attraction between Bobby Drake and Kitty Pryde, as she gets jealous when he tried to flirt with Emma Frost, and later he struggles to ask Kitty on a date.</p><p>He is also powerful and has a confident use over his mutants powers at such a young age. He can freeze thick metal walls, making them brittle and easier to break. He has also created a sizable floating island of ice in the middle of the ocean, large enough to land two aeroplanes on and for the X-Men to fight the Brotherhood on. As well as being able to create his trademark ice-slides, Iceman can also cause his ice structures to reduce back into water.</p><h3>The Super Hero Squad</h3><p>Iceman appears in the episode \"Mysterious Mayhem in Mutant Academy\", he is voiced by Shaun Ashmore, and he is a student attending the academy.</p><p>He also appears in another episode \"The Ice Melt Cometh\" where Iron Man requires Iceman's powers to refreeze the polar icecap at the North Pole, Iceman initially refuses saying that every time someone is too hot that take advantage of his powers and he want's to be left alone in his Icy Cave of Aloneness - Iron Man ends up tricking him into assisting by falsely offering \"free\" donuts, to which Iceman says he always falls for it.</p><h2>X-Men Films</h2><p>In all three X-Men films Bobby Drake/Iceman is played by <a href=\"../../wiki/Shawn_Ashmore\" rel=\"nofollow\"><u>Shawn Ashmore</u></a>. When Rogue first arrives at the Institute, he is one of the first to comfort her by offering her a heart made of ice. When Mystique takes the form of Bobby and tells Rogue that the school is better without her, it puts somewhat of a stress on her emotions for him. Bobby is absent during the fight on The Statue of Liberty, but he is seen playing a game with Rogue at the end of the movie.

When the X-Men arrive at lkali Lake, Pyro, Bobby, and Rogue are left on the X-Jet while the others go into the dam. Pyro leaves and Bobby and Rogue are left. They help get the captured students back onto the jet, and and leave with the remaining X-Men.</p><p>In X-Men: The Last Stand the third in the movie franchise, Bobby has his biggest role. His and Rogues relationship is strained more then ever and Bobby seems to be starting to have feelings for fellow X-Man; Kitty Pryde. By the final battle Bobby is standing as an official X-Man. He comes face-to-face with his former best-friend; Pyro. During their fight Bobby takes on his true ice form, much like the one from the comics. His body completely covered in ice. Bobby knocks Pyro out and moves on to help with the rest of the battle. When Bobby returns to the school, he finds Rogue in her room and finds that she has taken 'the cure', unlike her comic counterpart who has come to terms.</p><h2>Video Games</h2><h3>Fantastic Four (1997)</h3><p>Iceman makes his appearance as the bonus level boss.</p><h3>X-Men Legends &amp; X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse</h3><p>Iceman is a playable character in this X-Men series.</p><h3>X-Men: the Official Game</h3><p>Iceman is one of the three playable characters, he is voiced by Shaun Ashmore.</p><h3>Marvel Ultimate Alliance &amp; Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</h3><p>Iceman is a playable character and with other X-Men characters like Wolverine, <a href=\"../../colossus/29-1460/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colossus</a>, or Storm to get a team bonus when put on the same team.

Since his creation, Wonder Man has appeared primarily in the Avengers related titles. He has been portrayed at varying times as an insecure hero, a Hollywood egomaniac, and a sharp critic of the Avengers. A frequent theme with Wonder Man is his fear of death, having \"died\" twice before. His body is formed of solid ionic energy and he often struggles over whether or not he is even \"human\".</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Simon evolved over time from a bitter, jealous man, who sought revenge against Tony Stark, to a hero who sacrificed his life for the Avengers.

This personality transformation caused him to come into conflict with his fellow Avengers, until he ultimately tempered his ego. Simon underwent a number of personal challenges during his time with the West Coast Avengers, including several power transformations into a less \"human\" being of pure energy. His romantic feelings towards the Scarlet Witch would cause him tremendous heart break and guilt. After the Avengers faced a series of tragedies, including the Witch's mental breakdown, the <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, Skrull/ <a href=\"/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a>, and Osborn's <a href=\"/dark-reign/39-55707/\">Dark Reign</a>, Simon grew resentful towards the Avengers. He has become bitter and angry with his former teammates, blaming them for the series of calamities the world has faced. Simon's current mental and physical state is in question, as he appears to be undergoing a breakdown and \"leaking\" energy.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Masters of Evil</h3><p>Simon's introduction story. After years of financial failings, bitterness, and jealousy drove him to make a deal with Baron Zemo and the Masters of Evil, Simon sacrificed his life to save the Avengers.</p><h3>The Vision</h3><p>While Simon was \"dead\", the villain Ultron used a copy of his brain pattern as the basis for the Vision's artificial intelligence. Years later when Simon was resurrected, he would struggle with the idea of the Vision.

He became a full time Avenger in Avengers #160.</p><h3>West Coast Avengers Assemble</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"632367\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/632367-1_super.jpg\" title=\"Simon Williams: Hollywood action hero.\"><img id=\"632367\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/632367-1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Williams: Hollywood action hero.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Simon Williams: Hollywood action hero.</div></div></div></div><p>Simon was one of the founding members of the <a href=\"/avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\">West Coast Avengers</a>. In the early years he continued to struggle with his fear of death, until overcoming these fears during a battle with Gravitron. In defeating Gravitron, Simon discovered a new found confidence that grew over time into arrogance. Personally, he embarked upon a new career as a successful Hollywood action hero. Simon's sudden fame and celebrity went to his head, causing him to question Hawkeye's leadership and renew his rivalry with fellow teammate Iron Man. At one point Simon contemplated leaving the Avengers for a full time career as an actor, but after the Abomination attacked him during a public relations gathering for his new movie, Simon was struck by how shallow his Hollywood \"friends\" reacted to the destruction and began to change his ways.</p><h3>Visionquest</h3><p>When the governments of the world decided that the Vision was too great a threat to their national security, they banded together to abduct and erase the Vision's programming. Although Henry Pym was able to restore the Vision's body back to working order, he could not restore his personality without Simon's brain patterns. Simon refused; he had never given his permission before and couldn't be violated like that again. He revealed that he had secretly been in love with the Vision's wife, the Scarlet Witch, and it killed him that she had fallen in love with \"his\" personality programmed in the body of another man. The Witch was furious with Simon and dropped a cliff-side on him, screaming that she hated him for his selfishness. The Visionquest would ultimately contribute to Wanda's mental breakdown.</p><h3><b>Operation Galactic Storm</b></h3><p>During the Shiar/Kree War, Simon's body was seemingly destroyed in a massive Nega-Bomb explosion. The blast caused his body to undergo a further metamorphosis into a more ionic being. In addition to his enhanced strength and durability, Simon could now fly on his own power and shoot blasts of ionic energy. He later learned that he was now immortal, causing Simon to struggle greatly with this further loss of his humanity.</p><h3>Force Works</h3><p>When the West Coast Avengers were disbanded, Simon joined his fellow West Coast Avengers in Tony Stark's new group, <a href=\"/force-works/65-14245/\">Force Works</a>. In one of their first missions Simon was seemingly killed in an explosion in space. He wasn't actually killed but underwent an even further transformation into his ionic form. Simon's appearance changed from flesh to a purple colored being of \"starry\" energy. Month's later he was reformed by the Scarlet Witch and the two began a relationship that would ultimately end due to her inability to put the Vision behind her.</p><h3><b>Civil War</b></h3><p>Simon was one of the first to register after the announcement of the <a href=\"/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super Human Registration Act</a>. Not only did he help capture renegade vigilantes and criminals, he was also instrumental as the public face for the SHRA, helping to create televised messages to educate the public and yet-unregistered super humans about the specifics of the Registration Act. After embezzling money from his own charity he was coerced to do even more work for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a>., possibly as a way to seek pardon. He is one of the first established heroes assigned to lead the Fifty State Initiative training program for inexperienced hero recruits along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a>, with whom he is rumored to be having an intimate relationship. He was also pronounced a member of the reformed <a href=\"/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a>.</p><h3><b>Dark Reign</b></h3><p>After the Secret Invasion, Simon was retired from being a hero by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a>. He is then imprisoned as a member of the new <a href=\"/lethal-legion/65-42128/\">Lethal Legion</a>. Later he released when Captain Rogers takes Osborn's place and he invites Simon to join his new team of Avengers, Simon refused feeling bitter towards the Avengers blaming them for the Civil War, Secret Invasion, and Siege and hopes that Steve will change his mind or he will change it for him.</p><h3><b>Heroic Age</b></h3><p>After Iron Man and Thor confronted Simon over his attitude towards the Avengers, Iron Man remarked that Simon was \"leaking\" ionic energy. Simon appeared to be dematerializing. He looked sickly, lost hair, and acted and spoke irrationally, suggesting that something was seriously wrong with Wonder Man. Recently, Simon came to the conclusion that the Avengers simply cause more harm than good, stating that the endangerment of innocent bystanders as result of battles with enemies and the lure and even creation of villains from the Avengers being a famous superhero team outweigh all the good the team accomplishes. He gathered allies like Black Goliath and Virtue and formed his own team, the Revengers. They successfully assaulted Avengers Mansion and defeated the Avengers. Later, the Avengers took revenge on Wonder Man and his team and defeated them, but not before he is able to instill a degree of doubt in the general population as to the validity and consequences of the Avengers' actions. He is held in a cell, designed specifically, by Tony Stark, to contain his ionic form, and makes the claim that he has not been 'real' since his resurrection. While making this statement his energy based body seems to dissipate and, eventually, completely disappear.</p><h2>Powers And Abilities</h2><p>Through Baron Zemo's treatments, Simon became a being of ionic energy and in turn gained the following super-human powers.</p><h3>Strength</h3><p>Wonder Man strength levels are in excess of the 100 ton range, his strength is now comparable to Thor's.</p><h3><b>Invulnerability</b></h3><p>Wonder Man's skin and tissue has been rated a 9 on the Mohs scale of Hardness (normal human tissue equals a 1 and diamond equals 10).</p><p><b>Endurance</b></p><p>Since Simon gained his ionic form he has almost unlimited amounts of stamina and no longer needs food, water, or air to survive. Wonder Man also doesn't age <b>.</b></p><p><b>Speed</b></p><p>Though at first using a rocket propulsion belt to fly, he later learned to fly at high speeds using his own ionic propulsion. He also has enhanced agility as well almost instantaneous reflexes</p><h3>Ionic Energy</h3><p>Wonder Man uses his Ionic Energy in a number of ways, he can fire energy blasts change his shape and as mentioned above it helps him to fly.</p><p><b><u>Physical Statistics</u></b></p><p>Height: 6'2\"</p><p>Weight: 380lbs</p><p>Hair: Gray (dyed black)</p><p>Eyes: Red with spots of shifting energy.

She is the daughter of the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> and his late wife <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magda/29-45372/\">Magda</a>. Wanda is also the fraternal twin sister of Pietro ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a>) ; she was born first of the two. Shortly after Magda became pregnant, she witnessed her husband use his magnetic powers and realized that he was a mutant. Being terrified of mutants, Magda did not tell him of her pregnancy and fled from their home at the first opportunity. Magda eventually found refuge with a benevolent cow-like humanoid named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bova/29-11503/\">Bova</a>, who lived on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wundagore-mountain-transia/34-41286/\">Mount Wundagore</a> in Transia. The twins were born on Mt. Wundagore, and due to the mountain's mystical energy, it gave Wanda the ability to use magic in addition to her mutant powers. Shortly after the birth, Magda was driven mad with fear that Magneto might come for her and discover the twins. Despite Bova's attempts to reassure her, she fled the mountain during a blizzard in order to protect the twins, and apparently died of exposure soon afterward.</p><p>The motherless twins became the responsibility of Bova. A short time later, Bova helped a World War II heroine named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miss-america/29-13779/\">Miss America</a> give birth to a child fathered by her superhero husband, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whizzer/29-11840/\">Whizzer</a>, but unfortunately both child and mother died from radiation poisoning soon afterward. After Whizzer arrived, Bova only told him that Miss America had died, and gave him Pietro and Wanda, claiming they were his children. Whizzer initially took the twins with him, but once he discovered they were not his own, he immediately returned them to Bova on Mt. Wundagore.</p><p>Bova then found another set of foster parents for Wanda and Pietro named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/django-maximoff/29-11506/\">Django</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marya-maximoff/29-11507/\">Marya Maximoff</a>, who had just lost two children of their own. Django and Marya were Roma (gypsies), and unfortunately suffered from prejudice and persecution in Transia. Django worked as a doll-maker, but it was hard for him to find customers due to him being Roma. Django eventually had to steal food to keep his family from starving. When Wanda grew older, she was sexually molested by a boy her age, and was forced to use her powers to keep him away before running to safety. The villagers, however, accused Wanda of seducing the boy and attacked the Maximoffs, setting fire to the family\u2019s wagon. Marya was still inside and burned to death. They clubbed Django unconscious, but Wanda and Pietro were able to escape. Wanda and Pietro now believed that they were the only members of their family left. The two twins grew up together taking care of themselves, and Pietro grew very protective of Wanda.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Scarlet Witch was introduced in X-Men #4 by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Scarlet Witch has been through some major changes in her comics career.</p><h3>Silver Age</h3><p>Wanda began her career as a mutant on the side of evil, being a member of Magneto's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>. But just over a year later in May 1965 she joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and became a hero in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-avengers/49-2128/\">Avengers</a> #16. The line of good and bad with her blurred, not because of ideals, but because the slightest misuse of her powers was a cause of concern for both good and bad.</p><h3>Bronze Age and Modern Age</h3><p>For many years Wanda was a core member of the Avengers and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\">West Coast Avengers</a> teams. But the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-disassembled/39-43625/\">Avengers Disassembled</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/decimation/39-43626/\">Decimation</a> storylines radically altered her powers and her place in the Marvel Universe. Her powers had initially been portrayed as a simple ability to manipulate probability and generate hexes on her opponents. But following a breakdown caused by the realization that she had lost her children, Wanda manifested an ability to alter all of reality and caused the deaths of several characters as she lashed out at her former friends. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-childrens-crusade/39-56177/\">Children's Crusade</a> storyline, involving the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a> in a quest to find and confront the now amnesiac Wanda may once again alter her place in the Marvel Universe for good.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"284968\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/284968-38922-brotherhood-of-evil_super.jpg\" title=\"Brotherhood of Evil Mutants\"><img id=\"284968\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/284968-38922-brotherhood-of-evil_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Brotherhood of Evil Mutants\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually Wanda and Pietro used their powers in public again, resulting in their being attacked by a superstitious mob. Magneto arrived and saved their lives, and in returned they agreed to join his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>. Wanda became known as the Scarlet Witch, and Pietro, due to his power of super-speed, took the name Quicksilver. They were the first members of the Brotherhood, but neither Magneto nor the twins were aware that Magneto was their father.</p><p>Wanda was now a beautiful young woman and two male members of the Brotherhood, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toad/29-1470/\">Toad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, often tried to seduce her, but Magneto always protected her from them. However, Magneto would also inflict pain on Wanda whenever she thought of leaving the Brotherhood. Magneto recruited more powerful beings to aid the Brotherhood, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>, after Wanda failed her objectives during certain missions. Namor eventually quit the Brotherhood after witnessing Wanda being abused by Magneto for her disloyalty. After Magneto was taken from Earth by the cosmic entity called the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stranger/29-13332/\">Stranger</a>, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants effectively disbanded. The American superhero <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> then asked Wanda and Pietro to join his team of heroes, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>.</p><p><b>The Avenger</b></p><p>The twins briefly went back to Europe to consider the offer, but soon returned to America and joined the Avengers.

During her stay with the Avengers, Wanda became attracted to the android Avenger known as the <a>Vision</a>, and the two began dating romantically.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"350382\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18318/350382-112172-scarlet-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"Wanda and Pietro\"><img id=\"350382\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18318/350382-112172-scarlet-witch_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wanda and Pietro\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wanda and Pietro</div></div></div></div><p>Both Pietro and Hawkeye were very vocal in their disagreement with the relationship. Pietro felt dating an android was beneath Wanda, and Hawkeye also disapproved because he had developed his own feelings for Wanda. Eventually Hawkeye got over his jealousy and gave Wanda and Vision his blessing. Pietro, on the other hand, denounced his sister\u2019s love. Later, during an argument with Hawkeye, a telepath named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> erased Pietro\u2019s hate for the Vision.</p><p>Also during her time with the Avengers, Wanda was tutored by a true witch named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/agatha-harkness/29-3327/\">Agatha Harkness</a>. Harkness helped her to understand and employ her powers more efficiently. She disciplined Wanda\u2019s magical ability and taught her to control her mutant hex power.</p><p>Wanda's romance with the Vision culminated in the two getting married. This important event in her life caused her to wonder who her real father was. For a time she believed that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/whizzer-frank/29-14422/\">Whizzer</a> was her biological father. Wanda eventually learned that Magneto was her real father, which made her even angrier at Magneto because of his abusive behavior during her time in the Brotherhood. Later, after Agatha Harkness died, Wanda became infused with magic powers that made her pregnant with twins, whom she named Thomas and William. Wanda and Vision decided to retire as Avengers in order to raise their children.</p><h3>West Coast Avengers</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"350472\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18318/350472-156898-scarlet-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"West Coast Avengers\"><img id=\"350472\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/18318/350472-156898-scarlet-witch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"West Coast Avengers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">West Coast Avengers</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> and Wanda eventually came out of retirement and joined a depleted West Coast Avengers. Vision was kidnapped by other countries that were still angered with his attempt to take over the world years earlier. Vision's memories were eventually wiped clean, leaving him completely robotic and logic driven and with no emotional attachment to anything, including Wanda. She decided to find a way to restore the Vision's memories and personality.</p><p>Wanda sought out <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>, who was considered the Vision\u2019s 'brother,' since the android's personality and memories had originally been created from Wonder Man's own. But since they shared the same psychic template, Wonder Man also loved Wanda and had always been jealous of the Vision. He wanted Wanda to marry him instead. Wonder Man was counseled by Wasp (who could not have children of her own and questioned the existence of Wanda\u2019s children), who convinced him to not allow anyone to use his memories to restore the Vision\u2019s.</p><p>Wanda\u2019s children began to fade in and out of existence. It was eventually revealed that Agatha Harkness was still alive, and had used mystical energies containing parts of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mephisto/29-2635/\">Mephisto</a>\u2019s soul, turning them into Wanda\u2019s children in order to hide them. One of Mephisto\u2019s minions kidnapped Wanda\u2019s children and reabsorbed them back into Mephisto. The Avengers attempted to rescue the children but failed. Agatha erased a grief-stricken Wanda\u2019s memories of her twins and helped the Avengers escape from Mephisto\u2019s realm.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"374024\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/374024-125813-scarlet-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"Vision and Scarlet Witch\"><img id=\"374024\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/374024-125813-scarlet-witch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Vision and Scarlet Witch\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Vision and Scarlet Witch</div></div></div></div><p>Everyone\u2019s life went on, with Vision still having no memories and showing little concern for Wanda on the battlefield. Vision eventually decided to leave the West Coast team to join the East Coast roster. Wanda begged Vision to stay by her side, but he told her that the East Coast needed him more then she did. This led to Wanda having a nervous breakdown and helping found a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, along with Magneto (who had returned to Earth) and Quicksilver. Pietro soon revealed that he only joined Magneto to take back his fragile sister. The West Coast Avengers tried to save Wanda but she was then kidnapped by Immortus. Immortus revealed that he had manipulated Wanda\u2019s relationship with Vision in order to destroy the android, and this process made Wanda emotionally fragile.</p><p>During the process, Wanda\u2019s mutant power connected her to multiple parallel universes. She was then rescued by the West Coast Avengers and rejoined the team. Wanda stayed on the West Coast Avengers for a long time. Hawkeye helped her deal with the loss of her husband and twins. Wanda became the leader of the West Coast Avengers, but soon left to become a founding member of a new team called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/force-works/65-14245/\">Force Works</a>. The ill-fated team did not last long, and Wonder Man died on the first Force Works mission. The group disbanded and Wanda rejoined the West Coast Avengers. Around this time, Vision began to regain his past memories and emotions for Wanda, and the couple tried to reconcile. The were interrupted when they had to battle <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a>.

Le Fey battled Vision and wounded him badly. Vision tells Wanda not to visit him because of his current status and her fragile mind. Wanda revisited Agatha Harkness where she learns that her mutant powers were still evolving. She is able to now channel Chaos Magic which is considered very dangerous by professional magicians. Wanda also learns that she can resurrect the dead now. After she was rejected by Vision so much, she decided to revive Wonder Man and pursue a relationship with him. They began having an obvious affair right in front of Vision who had his entire memories restored. However, their relationship would go nowhere after Wonder Man reveals that he does not want to get married and have children. Wanda dumped Wonder Man right after that. Soon Wanda and Vision would reconcile and try to rebuild their relationship. Wanda began using her Chaos Magic more and it started to consume her with chaos energy.</p><h3><b>Avengers Disassembled</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"139886\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/139886-35831-avengers-disassemble_super.jpg\" title=\"Wasp's troubling revelation\"><img id=\"139886\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/139886-35831-avengers-disassemble_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wasp's troubling revelation\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wasp's troubling revelation</div></div></div></div><p>When the Wasp began a romantic relationship with Hawkeye, she would constantly talk to Wanda about it. One day after Wasp had a few drinks, she revealed to Wanda that she once had children that were hidden to her. This triggered something deep inside Wanda\u2019s mind. She sought out her former teacher, Agatha Harkness to learn the truth, and murdered Agatha for the betrayal. She went on to exact her revenge on her fellow Avengers. She hit each of them unexpectedly. At this point Wanda was believed not to be in her right mind, driven mad by her immense power and the memory of the children she lost. It is highly likely that what she did to the other Avengers was unknown even to her, and their destruction was created on a subconscious level.</p><p>First the corpse of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jack-of-hearts/29-7213/\">Jack Of Hearts</a> was raised from the grave and blew up the Avengers Mansion, killing Scott Lang. It is not fully known whether this was actually Scott Lang's body, if his mind was in the body at the time of the attack, or if it was simply a construct generated by Wanda's magics which was meant to resemble the former Avenger. Next during a U.N. meeting where Iron Man was speaking, the unmasked Tony Stark became overwhelmed with the sensation of drunkenness despite his long term sobriety. He called out the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latverian</a> ambassador, talking about how the entire country should be wiped off the map, and threatening to kill the politician where he stood. Before Hank Pym was able to lecture Tony, Wanda's Avengers communicator signaled a code white, signaling that they were needed at the Mansion. As Stark flew off the United States Chief of Staff called him, informing him that he was being forced to resign from his position within the government.</p><p>Back at the mansion, SHIELD had arrived at the scene to lend assistance and investigate. The Vision flew in on an Avengers Quinjet, crashing into the side of the building. An apologetic Vision emerged from the rubble and ejected several metal orbs which grew into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron</a> robots. The Ultrons attacked the Avengers, sending <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> into a blind rage. After the Ultron robots were defeated She-Hulk ripped the body of the Vision in half, destroying him. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> arrived just in time to incapacitate her, but not before she had severely injured both Wasp and Lionheart.</p><p>At this point Wanda had either killed or taken several of her teammates out of action, most likely still not even realizing that she was behind the attacks. The remaining Avengers had little time to try to figure out what was happening or who was attacking them before returning to the Mansion. When they returned they found <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> as well as many past members who were close enough to assemble, and a few friends of the team. Fury was trying to get the superheroes who had arrived to leave so that they didn't mess up his investigation when a group of Kree warriors (generated by Wanda's magic) flew in to attack. During the attack on the Avengers, Hawkeye sacrificed himself to bring down the Kree warship.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"774746\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/774746-roughpromo_super.jpg\" title=\"With teammates Ms. Marvel and Wasp\"><img id=\"774746\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/774746-roughpromo_medium.jpg\" alt=\"With teammates Ms. Marvel and Wasp\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">With teammates Ms. Marvel and Wasp</div></div></div></div><p>After the destruction of the ship the remaining Kree fled and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> arrived to inform them that the attacks on the Avengers were magic based. He declared Wanda to be insane due to her possession of reality altering abilities that were beyond her comprehension or control. He was aghast that she had been allowed to live her life without checks and balances, saying anyone who had such a powerful control over probability would have a lost their grasp on reality. He scolded the Avengers for not consulting with him about Wanda\u2019s past. He also reveals that there is no such thing as \u201cChaos Magic.\u201d</p><p>Strange led the Avengers to Wanda who had began creating a fake reality around her composed of those she cared for. The arrival of the Avengers threatened this peace, and the existence of the children that she had once again willed into being. Wanda summoned new constructs of heroes and villains to battle the group of superheroes, and created demons to battle Strange. She was no match for Strange's power, and she was immobilized by him. It was then that Magneto, hearing of his daughter's mental break, arrived to rescue her. Magneto took Wanda back to Genosha in hopes of healing her broken mind.</p><h3><b>House of M</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"94162\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/94162-179678-scarlet-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"94162\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/94162-179678-scarlet-witch_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>While in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> asked <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> to help Wanda but he refuses to do so. Instead, Xavier put Wanda in a coma. She was trying to restore her husband\u2019s life and undo the harm she has caused. Xavier then calls a meeting with the Avengers and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> to decide whether they should allow Wanda to live or not. A horrified Pietro immediately came to Wanda and told her of this. He convinced her, while she was in this fragile mental state, to distort probability to create a new reality, called House of M. In this new reality, the mutant:human ratio was reversed, and Magneto was the supreme ruler (hence, House of M). Wanda was also not a mutant in this reality and she had children.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a> used her powers to restore the memories of a few mutants, who created an assault force to try and re-establish the correct reality. This militia assumed it was Magneto who convinced Wanda to create the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a>. They attacked the House of M with a full army and in the process, Layla was able to restore Magneto\u2019s memories. Wanda confessed it was Pietro that convinced her to warp reality.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"614937\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30477/614937-118755_54741_decimation_super_super.jpg\" title=\"No More Mutants\"><img id=\"614937\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30477/614937-118755_54741_decimation_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"No More Mutants\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">No More Mutants</div></div></div></div><p>Infuriated, Magneto yelled at his son for using his name in this and killed Pietro. Wanda then revived Pietro, angered that Magneto placed mutants over his own children. To remedy the problem, Wanda conjured all her powers and uttered the 3 most impacting words in all of the Marvel Universe: \"No more mutants\". This sling-shotted reality to where it was before with only a select few remembering what happened, and 99% of the mutant population had lost their powers. From that time onward the events were referred to as M-Day.</p><h3><b>Decimation</b></h3><p>It is later revealed, that not only does Wanda not remember House of M or have her powers, she does not have any recollection of who she was, and has created a new life for herself. She currently resides in an unknown village in Europe. Later, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a> was able to track Wanda down to a city near Wundagore Mountain. Hawkeye saves Wanda from thieves but Wanda reveals that she has no memories of her past and believes that she has lived in the village her entire life. She thanks Hawkeye and calls him her hero. The two begin to get close and eventually they sleep together.</p><p>After that Hawkeye awoke and tried to enter Aunt Agatha's room, but when he tried to grab the door knob, it disappeared as if by magic. Hawkeye looked at Wanda but she seems still asleep. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> has also tried to get Wanda to undo the damage she caused the mutant race. Instead, she tells him a story about the fisherman and the mermaid, after informing Beast his watch was a fake. He asks her questions about magic in the hopes it would trigger her memories, but she simply states she waiting for her Aunt Agatha (who many suspect to be Agatha Harkness) and does not believe in magic.</p><p>Beast dreams of having a conversation with Wanda, who tells him \"Sand is sand\" and that he shouldn't mourn the passing of what passes, that she didn't invent death. When he tells her she delivered a death sentence she reminds him that she spoke her mind and brought about change, not death. No more mutants, no more pain. However, when he brings up the valid point of asking about the mutants who were happy with their gifts, Wanda points out that he's still dreaming.</p><h3><b>The Children's Crusade</b></h3><p>The Young Avengers <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiccan/29-40505/\">Wiccan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/speed/29-40518/\">Speed</a>, convinced that The Scarlet Witch is their biological mother, go in search of the real Wanda. Along the way they encounter both Magneto and Quicksilver, who are quickly drawn into a fight as Pietro attempts to kill his father Magneto. Wiccan transports the Young Avengers, Magneto and Quicksilver to Transia to begin their search. In the midst of a fight, Wanda suddenly reappears, only to be 'killed' by Quicksilver, who had hurled some wooden stakes at Magneto but hit Wanda instead. This 'Wanda' is revealed to be a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doombot/29-11924/\">Doombot</a>, suggesting to the gathered group that Wanda is being held captive by Dr. Doom. After teleporting solo into Castle Doom, Wiccan encounters Wanda inside her private quarters. Hoping for a nice reunion with his mother, Wiccan attempts to tell her that he is her son. Unfortunately, Wanda has no knowledge of him or anything about her past life. She tells him she is set to marry <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doom</a> in a day.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1722584\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47406/1722584-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"Scarlet WItch - ready to marry Doom?\"><img id=\"1722584\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47406/1722584-witch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlet WItch - ready to marry Doom?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Scarlet WItch - ready to marry Doom?</div></div></div></div><p>Before Wiccan can do anything, Doom bursts into the room and knocks him out with a blast from his suit. Doom reveals to Wiccan (after healing him and removing his powers) that he didn't find Wanda, instead Wanda found him. She has lost her powers and has no recollection of her previous past. He also claimed that he loves her. On her wedding day Wanda frees Wiccan from his chains and tells him that Victor wasn't acting in his usual way when he saw Wiccan and she asks Wiccan to tell her everything.</p><p>Wiccan tells her about Scarlet Witch up till the event when he meets Speed. He cuts off in his mid sentence \"and I realized (that Speed and I are your lost twin sons)-\" when he sees that the Avengers as well as the Young Avengers and Magneto have arrived to battle Doom and Wanda. Wolverine sees Wanda and attacks her and is about to kill her when he gets hit from a laser beam from Iron Lad.</p><p>While the rest of the Avengers and Young Avengers reunite with Iron Lad, Doom slips away to Wanda and Wiccan and attempts to kill Billy. Wanda begs him to stop and says she doesn't believe Wiccan's story but wonders why Doom is so concerns she might have. Magneto burst through the wall and attacks Doom, while Billy slips away with Wanda saying they have to get her somewhere safe. Iron Lad appears and says he can help and transports all the Young Avengers and Wanda to his safe haven in the Timestream. Iron Lad says that to try and job Wanda's memory they should go back to the day it started, when Wanda resurrected Jack of Hearts and murdered her teammates. Everyone is worried about them (especially Cassie) changing the past but Iron Lad assures then that with his technology, they can inhabit the past without affecting it. He transports them all to the Avengers Mansion, the day of Wanda's breakdown, but she still doesn't recognize or recall anything. Cassie sees her deceased father, Scott Lang, and runs to him. To everyone's surprise, she is able to touch him and he can see her. Suddenly Jack of Hearts appears and the Young Avengers (with Scott in tow) run from him. Wanda stays behind and walks up to Jack, and he pleads with her about why she's making him do this. As Speed, grabs Wanda to escape, Jack exploded. They appear in the present with Scott Lang, but in this reality he is still dead, as he stand in front of his own memorial statue. They ask Iron Lad how that is possible and how he brought them and Scott there without changing the past. He replied that he didn't and then Wanda appears behind them saying that she did it. They turn to see Wanda, in her Scarlet Witch costume, telling them that Billy was right, she is the Scarlet Witch and she remembers everything.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1885336\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1885336-dfg.png\" title=\"Wanda with The Young Avengers and X-Factor\"><img id=\"1885336\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/60352/1885336-dfg_medium.png\" alt=\"Wanda with The Young Avengers and X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wanda with The Young Avengers and X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>Feeling guilty about her past misdeeds, Wanda attempts to commit suicide. Billy is able to talk her out of it by revealing that he believes himself and Speed to be her reincarnated children. He then requests that she use her powers to reveal whether or not he and Thomas are her children, to which she agrees. She realizes that they are in fact her children and she, Billy, and Thomas tearfully embrace each other. <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> suggests that Wanda absolve herself of her crimes by attempting to reverse the effects of M-Day. She is successfully able to restore the powers of the mutant known as <a href=\"/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a>, just as a team of X-Men show up to confront her. As the X-Men try to take Wanda into their custody both Magneto and the Avenger's defend her which leads to a battle between both teams. During the battle <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a> use's her telepathy to influence the thoughts of both Wiccan and Speed until Wanda interferes and cause's each member of both teams to fall asleep before teleporting herself and the <a href=\"/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a> to Doctor Doom's castle. There Doctor Doom and Wanda convince the Young Avengers into using a spell to separate Wanda from her powers. Combining the power's of Wanda, Wiccan and Doctor Doom they began their spell until it was interrupted by <a href=\"/patriot/29-2258/\">Patriot</a> who fired an explosive arrow at Wanda which interrupted the spell before it could be complete and thereby gave Doctor Doom all the power's that they were trying to harness.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"374003\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/374003-158247-scarlet-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"Using her hex power\"><img id=\"374003\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/374003-158247-scarlet-witch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Using her hex power\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Using her hex power</div></div></div></div><p>The Scarlet Witch possesses the mutant power of affecting probability fields. By a combination of gestures and mental concentration, she creates a hex-sphere, a finite pocket of reality-disrupting quasi-psionic force, which upon reaching its intended target, causes disturbance in the molecular-level probability field surrounding the target. Thus, unlikely phenomena will occur. Among the many phenomena she is able to cause are: the sudden melting of gun barrels, the spontaneous combustion of any flammable object, the rapid rust or decay of various organic and inorganic materials, the poltergeist-like deflection of an object in flight, the sudden evacuation of air from a given volume, the disruption of energy transmissions and fields, and so on. These phenomena occur practically instantaneously after the completion of her hex. Her range of hex-casting is limited by her line of sight. (She cannot watch a live television broadcast and cause a hex-phenomenon to occur at its point of origin.)</p><p>Scarlet Witch's hex-casting ability had a 20% unreliable factor and she is limited in the range of sight, although she has been able to overcome the latter limitation on occasion via extreme concentration and sorcerous enchantment.</p><p>Wanda is also a living focal point for the earth's magic. Her sorcerous training with Agatha Harkness is separate from her mutant ability of probability (science). But the mixture of the two makes her considerably more powerful than just using her probability powers. She has a special affinity for the natural elements and materials that true witches utilize in their spells: the four alchemical elements, wood, organic substances, etc. The reliability factor of her hex-casting ability is also limited by her physical condition: when well rested, in good health and mentally and emotionally alert Scarlet Witch can cast numerous hex-spheres in rapid succession and attain desirable results for almost an hour. However, certain events in House of M, have shown that her limits may have been removed altogether. And her powers actually evolved, giving her the mutant ability to alter reality on a vast scale by way of magic</p><p>In the House of M storyline, Wanda showed that she could fly, transform people and matter, fire powerful beams of magic, and disable other mutants abilities. She could also bring the dead back to life. And while it appears that Scarlet Witch may have depowered herself, an incident with Hawkeye shows that she may have in fact retained her reality altering powers. Another hint of this, is that Wanda is 1/3 the earth's High Priestess, As seen in tarot cards. Showing that there is still hope for her after all.</p><h2>Personal Data</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"911952\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/911952-scarlet_witch_litho_by_diablo2003_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"911952\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/911952-scarlet_witch_litho_by_diablo2003_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p><b>Height:</b> 5' 7\"</p><p><b>Weight</b>: 132 lbs (60 kg)</p><p><b>Eyes</b>: Blue</p><p><b>Hair</b>: Auburn</p><h3>Status</h3><p><b>Known Relatives:</b> Magnus aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> (father), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magda/29-45372/\">Magda</a> Lehnsherr (mother, deceased), Pietro aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> (twin brother), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anya/29-45373/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anya</a> (sister, deceased), Lorna Dane aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a> (half-sister), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> (estranged husband), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/django-maximoff/29-11506/\">Django Maximoff</a> (foster father, deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marya-maximoff/29-11507/\">Marya Maximoff</a> (foster mother, deceased), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crystal/29-2115/\">Crystal</a> (sister-in-law), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luna/29-10962/\">Luna</a> (niece), <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/speed/29-40518/\">Tommy</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiccan/29-40505/\">Billy</a> (reincarnated sons), Talia Wagner aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nocturne/29-4565/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nocturne</a> (alternate reality daughter), unborn twins of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/speed/29-40518/\">Tommy</a> and Kate Kildare (alternate reality grandchildren).</p><p><b>Citizenship:</b> Transian (U.S. naturalized)</p><p><b>Place of Birth:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wundagore-mountain-transia/34-41286/\">Wundagore Mountain, Transia</a></p><p><b>Marital Status:</b> Divorced</p><p><b>Occupations:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avenger</a>, adventurer, witchcraft tutor, housewife, former terrorist (with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>)</p><p><b>Education:</b> Unrevealed</p><h2>Alternate Universes</h2><h3>Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"271945\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10268/271945-111853-scarlet-witch_super.jpg\" title=\"Age of Apocalypse\"><img id=\"271945\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10268/271945-111853-scarlet-witch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Age of Apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Age of Apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>In the alternate reality called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a>, Wanda's life was short lived.

Upon their return, Quicksilver's powers had somehow increased, as he could now fly for short distances by vibrating his feet at high speeds. Shortly after their return, Quicksilver willingly joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a> after Scarlet Witch was hit by a bullet, shot by a \"mere human\".

Turned from his path of terrorism, he too had been on a quest to his past trying to retrace the last steps of his missing wife. Thinking him nothing more than an innocent traveler, Bova had also told Magneto Magda\u2019s story and unwittingly informed him that he was the father of the very youths he had manipulated and browbeaten in the Brotherhood. He had immediately rushed to Attilan to inform the twins who were shocked. While Wanda was confused and unsure, Pietro was appalled. He rejected Magneto outright. While Magneto was in his reform period, he earned Pietro\u2019s tentative respect, but not his acceptance. When Magneto returned to terrorism, Pietro hated him all the more.</p><h3>The First Fall</h3><p>Naturally arrogant, impatient, and of a jealous temperament, Pietro left Attilan when he discovered that Crystal had had an affair. He soon began behaving very irrationally, going insane to the point he tried to frame the Avengers for treason and proclaimed himself King of all the Mutants. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> finally captured him and returned him to Attilan, it was discovered that Pietro\u2019s insanity had been caused by the Inhuman <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maximus-the-mad/29-13443/\">Maximus The Mad</a>. When Magneto attempted to manipulate the Scarlet Witch in her grief over the loss of her husband, Pietro was able to use this period of insanity as a cover to stay close by his sister\u2019s side. After helping to rescue her from both Magneto and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/immortus/29-7215/\">Immortus</a>, Pietro remained on earth.</p><h3>Hero Once Again</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1228629\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1228629-fantasticfour_v1_304_p20_super.jpg\" title=\"Fighting the Fantastic Four\"><img id=\"1228629\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1228629-fantasticfour_v1_304_p20_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting the Fantastic Four\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fighting the Fantastic Four</div></div></div></div><p>Quicksilver would spend time working with the government sponsored mutant group X-Factor. Luna was kidnapped by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fabian-cortez/29-9728/\">Fabian Cortez</a>, who wanted to use Luna as a symbol of Magneto\u2019s sovereignty and as a human shield. Rushing to her rescue, Pietro encountered Crystal and the Avengers. They were successful in rescuing their daughter, though Pietro almost sacrificed his life in a fight with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exodus/29-4567/\">Exodus</a> in the process. Pietro left X-Factor and remained in close contact with the Avengers, though he refused to officially join until his romantic rival for Crystal\u2019s affection, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-knight/29-3172/\">Black Knight</a>, left. Pietro strove to reconcile with Crystal and the two were beginning to create a family again when Crystal was lost with many other heroes in a pocket universe in the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/39-43814/\">Onslaught</a>. Pietro remained in loose association with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> for a time, his main concern to care for his daughter.</p><p>Upon hearing that Exodus and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/acolytes/65-9730/\">Acolytes</a> were planning an assault on the High Evolutionary\u2019s citadel, Pietro joined the <a href=\"/knights-of-wundagore/65-13937/\">Knights of Wundagore</a> and he and Luna lived there for a time. While he was there, Pietro was exposed to Isotope E, a material with enhanced his powers of speed to a great degree.</p><p>Sending Luna to Crystal, Pietro joined Magneto\u2019s cabinet when the U.N. granted him rule over <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a> following the events of the Magneto War. Pietro still resented and distrusted Magneto a great deal, but felt he had to stay in order to ensure Magneto\u2019s policies did not become too tyrannical. Eventually, he rebelled and Magneto threw him out of the country. He snuck back in with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/polaris/29-1473/\">Polaris</a> to help the human underground, but was eventually caught and deported again.</p><h3>The Second Fall</h3><p>Pietro was vacationing, \u201creading a book\u201d, when the Scarlet Witch went insane and attacked the Avengers, killing three of them including her husband. While the Avengers and X-Men met with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> to discuss Wanda\u2019s fate. Pietro became convinced that the assembled group was going to kill her and rushed to Genosha and begged for Magneto\u2019s aid. Defeated and out of options, Magneto could not think of what to do. Pietro then convinced the Scarlet Witch to remake the world into the House of M reality in which everyone had their fondest wishes granted. Most importantly their father, who received the global power he had long desired over a world in which the mutant population was the ascending majority. Pietro served his father as a loyal prince. When the deception was revealed, Magneto went into a terrible rage, beating Pietro to death. Wanda restored her brother to life, but then took his power away with 99% of the mutant population when she uttered the fatal phrase \u201cNo more mutants.\u201d</p><p>Depowered and suicidal, Crystal brought Pietro to Attilan to recover. After he did, Pietro snuck into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">Terrigen Mists</a> chamber to regain his powers. Instead, he received the ability to travel in time. He stole pieces of the Terrigen crystals and he exposed Luna to them repeatedly, granting her empathic abilities. He then proclaimed himself a \u201cSavior\u201d of mutant kind, setting up shop in Mutant Town and promising to restore the powers of the mutants who had lost theirs on M-Day. What he did not inform his clients however, was that the crystals did not restore mutant powers safely and many people died as a result of Pietro\u2019s \u201ctreatments\u201d. The Inhumans visited Quicksilver in order to reclaim the crystals, but Pietro revealed that he had worked with the crystals so much, they became embedded in his skin. At that time, Crystal told Quicksilver that their marriage was annulled. After several deaths, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a> used his temporarily restored powers to eject the crystals from Pietro body, depowering him once again. Pietro later saved <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/layla-miller/29-1447/\">Layla Miller</a> from drowning, because he planned on killing her himself, for being the cause of the their downfall in the House of M. Layla later escaped when Pietro became hesitant about killing her.</p><p>After his fight with Layla Miller, Pietro was found unconscious in Central Park. Not knowing who he was, the police threw Pietro in general lock up where he experienced a series of hallucinations: His sister, his father, his wife and child, and Layla Miller who explained that Pietro had hit rock bottom and hinted that he was still a mutant. From the windows of the prison Pietro observed a woman in the</p><p>process of being pushed off a roof by her boyfriend. Using his super speed, broke out of prison and saved her, coming to terms with the his past villainous acts and looking forward to a better future.</p><h3>The Rise of Chthon</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"685329\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/685329-bigimage_biog_super.jpg\" title=\"Chthon\"><img id=\"685329\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9241/685329-bigimage_biog_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Chthon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Chthon</div></div></div></div><p>After being taken prisoner by <a href=\"/modred-the-mystic/29-13924/\">Modred the Mystic</a>, Quicksilver's body was offered up as a vessel to the demonic Elder God <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chthon/29-15683/\">Chthon</a> and was completely overtaken by him.

Pietro proceeded to write off all his recent crimes as having been committed by a <a href=\"/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrull</a> impostor and officially join the team, with the ulterior motive of reuniting with his sister.</p><p>After helping Pym with his personal war against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a> came into conflict with the ancient Inhuman emperor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-unspoken/29-63591/\">The Unspoken</a>. With the aid of all active avengers, they managed to put an end to the fallen king's mad scheme. Pietro used this as an opportunity to reunite with his ex-wife Crystal and his daughter, Luna, and the Inhumans officially pardon him of any crimes against their race. Unfortunately, Luna is aware that he was not, in fact replaced by a Skrull. She promises, out of love for her father, not to tell anyone, but lets him know that she can never respect him again.</p><h3>Children's Crusade</h3><p>He recently joined the effort to locate his long lost sister, the Scarlet Witch.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p><b>Gender:</b> Male</p><p><b>Height:</b> 6' 0\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 175 lbs (80 kg)</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</p><p><b>Hair:</b> White</p><h2>Powers</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"632335\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/632335-1_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"632335\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/632335-1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Quicksilver was at first able to reach the speed of sound, which is about 770 mph, but exposure to the High Evolutionary's Isotope E made it possible for him to run at supersonic speeds of up to Mach 5, about 3805 mph. Using his super speed, Pietro was able to achieve various effects such as \"out running gravity\" for short periods, such as running across water or up walls. By running in circles, he could creates whirlwind vortexes of great intensity. He could vibrate his muscles extremely fast, creating destructive effects on anything he touched. He recently seems to have regained his original abilities.</p><p>Under the influence of the Terrigen Crystals Quicksilver could vibrate his atoms so quickly that the molecular speed he generates displaces him out of mainstream time and space and a \"jump\" into the future. Quicksilver could initially jump from an hour to up to twelve days into the future and remain for several minutes or even several hours before tiring and being recalled to his present time. Quicksilver can also return at will at any time. When Quicksilver returns, he arrives back at almost the exact moment and place he left so as to appear to have been gone for a nano-second. Quicksilver is also able to bring inorganic objects back from the future. This ability, however, seems to have affected his physical health, as each time Quicksilver meets up with a future self, they look increasingly haggard. Quicksilver has also discovered how to jump only mere seconds ahead in time, and create an indefinite number of \"temporal dupes\" that can be controlled with a certain amount of coordination.</p><p>After <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rictor/29-10988/\">Rictor</a> ejected the crystals from Pietro's body, he was depowered for a short time.</p><p>Quicksilver's powers soon returned, and he has recently displayed abilities that far exceed his old limitations.

Victor's mother, Cynthia, was killed soon after she called upon the demon <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mephisto/2635/\">Mephisto</a> for power. She left Victor with his father, asking him to protect him from Mephisto. Victor's father, Werner, was a doctor who was called upon by King Vladimir of Latveria to treat his wife. Unable to do so, Werner fled with Victor and died soon afterward trying to protect his son. Victor was left with his father's best friend Boris. Victor later discovered his mother's mystical books and artifacts. With them he was able to teach himself sorcery. He made several unsuccessful attempts to free his mother's soul from Mephisto.</p><p>Victor excelled in science, developed several inventions, and was eventually given a scholarship to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empire-state-university/34-43783/\">Empire State University</a>. While attending this school Victor met Reed Richards, who would later become his enemy, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>. In school, they were considered scholarly rivals. One day, Victor designed an invention to rescue his mother which would become his greatest downfall. Richards attempted to warn Victor of an error in his calculations. However, Von Doom's arrogance refused to let him listen. The machine then exploded, scarring his face, and led to his expulsion from the university.</p><p>Von Doom later went to Tibet and found an old order of monks. He practiced their ways enough for him to become their leader. Von Doom then asked them make his first suit of armor. Eager to wear the suit, Doom placed the still-hot steel faceplate to his face, making him even more scarred than before. As Dr. Doom, he then killed Baron Vladimir and imprisoned his son <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prince-rudolfo/29-35539/\">Rudolfo</a>, and gained control over Latveria. Rudolfo would escape and lead a rebellion and become a thorn in Doom's side for years till his death. Later, Rudolfo's younger brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zorba/29-34454/\">Zorba</a> would take over where his brother left off. Doom using his intellect and inventions, turned Latveria into a thriving nation.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Doctor Doom was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in Fantastic Four #5.

He first tried to get the Fantastic Four to steal some gems which were originally Merlin's from the past and would bring him great power, but this plan ended in failure.</p><p>He teamed up with other superhero, Namor , to try to defeat the Four and almost succeeded. He was defeated and stranded in space where he was rescued by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ovoids/65-13930/\">Ovoids</a>. He was able to learn much of their technology and used it upon his return to Earth to try to defeat the Four again. He switched bodies with Reed Richards and impersonated him. He planned to shrink the rest of the team into nothingness, but the plan backfired and it was Doom who was shrunken.</p><p>After being shrunken, Doom had entered the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/microverse/34-43832/\">Microverse</a>, a land of peace ripe for the taking. After befriending the King and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/princess-pearla/29-20598/\">Princess Pearla</a> he became the court magician (because of his advanced science that was unknown to them). He had their people build his weapons for him and soon turned on this royal friends and shrunk them further, taking control of their planet. He then built another machine to tamper with the lives of the Fantastic Four, which eventually brought them to his doorstep. Once captured, he planned to trade the Four to the Lizard Men of Tok, brutal conquerors of the Microverse, in exchange for allegiance. Of course the Fantastic Four were able to escape. Once Doom noticed they had, he returned to the normal world, not giving up on his plans of revenge. He began his plans immediately, kidnapping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alicia-masters/29-4337/\">Alicia Masters</a> to his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flying-fortress/18-42381/\">Flying Fortress</a> and warning the Fantastic Four to not interfere if they wish to see her again. He then sent a note to the President of the United States demanding a spot in the cabinet or else he would wage war against the country. After he received no response, Doom attacked the US mainframe, taking control of it's electricity and weapons. The Fantastic Four were helpless, Doom having used his 'followers' to map their atomic structures, making it impossible for them to attack him without being disintegrated.</p><p>But Reed outsmarted Doom again, transforming the Thing back into Ben Grimm temporarily, enabling him to breach Doom's defenses and allow the rest of the team entrance. Doom still had booby traps for the team but they still were able to reach him. Doom went to grab Alicia, knowing they would never risk her safety, only to find the Invisible Woman had switched places with her. Doom was defeated again and rather than be captured and humiliated he jumped from the Fortress to escape.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2229791\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2229791-doom_vs_overmind_ff_116.jpg\" title=\"Fantastic Four 116 - Doom vs the Overmind\"><img id=\"2229791\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2229791-doom_vs_overmind_ff_116_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fantastic Four 116 - Doom vs the Overmind\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fantastic Four 116 - Doom vs the Overmind</div></div></div></div><p>The most unusual Fantastic Four-Doctor Doom tale occured in Fantastic Four 116. The Earth was in grave danger from the foe called Overmind. He was so powerful that he even took control of Mr. Fantastic's will and made him his lackey. However, Agatha Harkness appeared to the Invisible Girl and urged her to contact Doctor Doom, the one person who could help. Susan went to Doom and at first he refused her request for aid, but she was eventually able to convince him to change his mind. Doom led the Human Torch, the Thing and the Invisible Girl in battle against the Overmind.</p><p>One of his enemies was the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a>. He was able to steal the Silver Surfer's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-cosmic/12-41039/\">Power Cosmic</a> and become one of the most powerful beings on Earth, but again, his plan was stopped by the Fantastic Four. They managed to trick him into flying outside of Earth's boundaries, therefore meaning that since Galactus had placed boundaries to stop the Silver Surfer leaving, Doom's power was lost. During the events of the first <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-wars/39-40978/\">Secret Wars</a>, he was able to steal the powers of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a> and then the powers of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beyonder/29-10300/\">Beyonder</a>. He was stopped when the Beyonder took possession of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/klaw/29-3171/\">Klaw</a>'s body and used Klaw's guile to trick Dr. Doom into losing his powers.</p><p>Dr. Doom became the runner-up at the Aged Genghis's contest. As stated in the rules of the match, he was given one request from the winner, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>. Dr. Doom's request was to free his mother's soul from Mephisto. Together, they were able to free the soul of his mother, but at the price of her undying hatred against her son.</p><h3>Heroes Reborn</h3><p>When the threat of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a> arrived on Earth, Doom saw this as an opportunity to steal the being's powers. When Earth's heroes learned they must sacrifice themselves to defeat Onslaught, Iron Man decided Doom should help with that sacrifice. Iron Man grabbed Doom and pulled him into Onslaught's essence, killing him.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a> created a pocket universe for the heroes to live in. Doom remained much as he had before. Unlike most of the heroes, Doom seemed to remember the past events of Onslaught. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a> came to Earth to consume it, Doom was met by a future version of himself and given information and technology to help him. Doom first tried to steal the cosmic powers of Galactus' heralds. Soon realizing he was no match for Galactus and realizing the planet was doomed, he travelled back in time to try to prevent this. After two more attempts to stop Galactus and turn it towards his favor, Doom finally worked with the heroes and the Silver Surfer to defeat Galactus. Eventually, after the heroes returned back to their normal Earth, Doom remained behind. He took over the world and moved it from the pocket universe to his original universe with magic and technology, putting it in the same orbit as Earth, only on the opposite side, creating a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/counter-earth/34-54572/\">Counter Earth</a>. Eventually he was overthrown and returned to his rightful planet.</p><h3>Valeria</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"436740\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/436740-doom_mike_wieringo_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Doom\"><img id=\"436740\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/436740-doom_mike_wieringo_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Doom\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Doom</div></div></div></div><p>During his youth, he fell in love with a woman named Valeria, but she declined his advances. He made a pact with the Hazareth Three, which involved sacrificing her in order to gain more power. This act is generally considered to be the precursor to a new Dr. Doom who regretted the crime against Valeria. It is stated to be the reason for Doom naming Reed's daughter Valeria, after the woman he truly loved but killed. He considers himself to be the self-appointed guardian of young Valeria as he feels this is the way he can atone for the death of his love. However, Marvel has not mentioned exactly what triggered this emotional sentiment in Doom to bring back the memory of Valeria. He became trapped in Hell when he was tricked by the Fantastic Four and Dr. Strange.</p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mjolnir/18-40971/\">Mjolnir</a> was floating and passing through all realities, it made a hole in hell for Doom to escape. When Mjolnir landed on Earth, Doom tried to claim it, but he was unworthy. He later returned to Latveria and rediscovered his magical heritage to defeat his enemies. He later welcomed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atlanteans/65-13407/\">Atlanteans</a> to Latveria when their kingdom was destroyed and later aligned himself with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> to plot against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> and the release of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/asgard/34-40990/\">Asgard</a>'s enemies.</p><p>Doom then faced the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mighty-avengers/65-46148/\">Mighty Avengers</a> after he released <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/symbiote/12-42358/\">Symbiote</a> from one of his satellites. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a>, and Doom were fighting, they were suddenly brought back to the past. The three had to work together to get back to the present by using Mr. Fantastic's time machine from that time line. But when they got back, Doom sent Iron Man to a time when his castle was only moments away from exploding. With Iron Man out of the way, he easily defeated the Avengers. Iron Man however, managed to escape in the nick of time. That, combined with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a>'s breakout from Doom's prison proved to be the start of his downfall and Doom was finally apprehended.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the Marvel Civil War, Dr. Doom had been abandoned in hell (Mobius Dimension) by the Fantastic Four. There, he conducted a valiant battle against innumerable demons. He escaped when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>'s hammer passed through that plane of existence, on its journey to Earth. When back on Earth, he found that his Prime Minister had taken over his country, after two years of Doom being absent. The Minister was about to make serious changes in the government, when Doom intervened. He then set about the task of retrieving the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mjolnir/18-40971/\">Mjolnir</a>. After fighting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> and the Fantastic Four, he arrived at the hammer only to find he could not lift it. He returned to Latveria, frustrated.</p><p>In Latveria he was approached by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a> and his wife, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> to form a united front against the registration act of the US. At the time Black Panther was seeking aide from countries such as the UK and Atlantis. Although Doom agreed with Black Panther, he did not involve himself in combat on US soil during the war.</p><h3>Dark Reign</h3><p>In the fallout of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-invasion/39-47264/\">Secret Invasion</a> we first see Dr. Doom attending the meeting of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cabal/65-56051/\">Dark Illuminati</a>. Victor is unimpressed with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">Norman Osborn's</a> brave new world but plays ball anyways. Following the departure of the other Illuminati, Namor and Doom talk about their real plans. Doom says that if things do not go the way he thinks there will be a battle the likes the universe has never seen.</p><p>Upon his return to Latveria, Doom is attacked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morgan-le-fay/29-13925/\">Morgana Ley Fay</a> after she had attempted to murder him in the past. The powerful witch blasts Doom and knocks him down for the count. As Morgana moves in for the kill Doom is saved by Norman Osborn and his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a>. Dr. Doom has also been working with groups of B-Ranked super-villains since the Secret Invasion. He smashed up the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sinister-six/65-40429/\">Sinister Six</a>, (Kraven, Doc Ock., Sandman, Chameleon, Vulture, and Mysterio) before telling them he just had plans for them. Doom gives them instructions and helps them enhance their powers while he uses them to further his agenda.</p><p>After this we see Dr. Doom teamed up with the Circus of Crime searching for the secret of eternal life. They come into a clash with Baron Zemo and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/masters-of-evil/65-7582/\">Masters of Evil</a>. It is revealed that the battle between the two groups was a test set-up by Doom to see who he would recruit. Even though the Circus won (with a very great deal of help from Doom.) Doom recruits the Masters of Evil but also extends his hand to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/princess-python/29-10859/\">Python Princess</a>. Doom had one last meeting with Norman and his Cabal, but still refused to side with Norman. To show off his power, Norman unleashed his 'secret weapon' on Doom and defeated him. But Doom was obviously prepared for this sort of attack, sending a Doombot in his place. The Doombot unleashed advanced technology to attack the Cabal and Norman's Dark Avengers. Doom had made it clear that no one controls Doctor Doom.</p><h3>Fall of the Hulks</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1328081\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/1328081-doctor_doom___incredible_hulk__609_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1328081\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/38780/1328081-doctor_doom___incredible_hulk__609_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Long ago, Doom was approached by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/leader/29-7617/\">Leader</a> and his super villain group the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/intelligencia/65-56959/\">Intelligencia</a>. They planned to steal the lost information of the Library of Alexandria and needs a safe place to store it, which Doom could provide in Latveria. Doom did not participate on any of the missions to obtain the information. When the last piece of info was retrieved, Doom betrayed them. He took the information for himself and had his guards attack the other members. Recently, the group reformed and with their technology and expertise created the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-hulk/29-56974/\">Red Hulk</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-she-hulk/29-65529/\">Red She-Hulk</a>. They planned to 'lobotomize' the competition and capture eight of Earth's greatest minds, including Doom.</p><p>Doom was attacked by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, who turned out to be the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-hulk/29-68919/\">Cosmic Hulk</a> , controlled by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/modok/29-3709/\">MODOK</a> and the Leader. Doom was able to absorb the robot's energy but at the same time took the bait and absorbed a 'neural anesthetizer' that diminished his mental abilities. Lacking the needed intelligence to operate his devices or remember his magical incantations, Doom was captured by the Cosmic Hulk and transported to the location of the Intelligencia. In his captivity, Doom's now diminished mind can only think of revenge against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Bruce Banner</a>, whom he mistakenly blames for his abduction.</p><p>Doom and the other geniuses were all attached to a device on the Intelligencia's Hellcarrier. Inside the device was a fantasy world to control them, but Doom was not convinced by the illusion. But the device slowly drained their intelligence. Doom knew the world was fake but did not have the intelligence left to make an escape plan. He convinced Bruce that he was the only one with the mental capacity to release them, since he had not been in the machine as long. Bruce finally did what was needed and allowed their escape. In classic Doom fashion, he attempted to use the machine to transfer all the other geniuses knowledge into his own mind. Doom had not realized that his mental abilities were still diminished from the earlier attack and hooked himself to the machine incorrectly, further frying his own brain. He once again swore revenge on Bruce Banner, this time the real one, before the Red She-Hulk punched Doom through the wall and sent him plummeting to Earth.</p><h3>Doomwar</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1260137\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47452/1260137-doomwar_3_paperpirate_cps_026_super.jpg\" title=\"Doom's imagination, Doomworld\"><img id=\"1260137\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47452/1260137-doomwar_3_paperpirate_cps_026_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Doom's imagination, Doomworld\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Doom's imagination, Doomworld</div></div></div></div><p>When Doom learned of a xenophobic group of <a href=\"../../wakanda/34-41027/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wakandans</a> known as the Desturi, he began his plans for gaining access to the <a href=\"../../vibranium/18-40919/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vibranium</a> supplies of Wakanda. Vibranium has the ability to be magically charged and has infinite power potential, something Doom has figured how to do and could be virtually unstoppable with the vast amounts of Vibranium located in Wakanda. Doom funded the Desturi to begin their revolt and takeover. Doom developed nanite cameras which were dispersed into all Wakandans which made them unknowing spies for Doom. With all the security information of Wakanda available to him, he was able to gain access to the vault that contains the country's Vibranium. Doom has no interest in ruling Wakanda. If all goes according to his plans, he will take the Vibranium and turn the country into a wasteland. Having captured Storm, Doom demands she open the last locks. But she cannot open it. Doom discovers that to enter the vault 'Only Through Purity Unencumbered by Pretense May You Pass,' something Doom could never enter.</p><p>But Doom has not planned this for so long to be stopped now. He strips himself, leaving him totally vulnerable and enters the doorway. There he is met by the Panther God of Wakanda, <a href=\"../../panther-god/29-22575/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bast</a>, who is able to probe Doom's mind and soul for his impurities and bad intentions. At first glance, Bast calls Doom a monster, having caused countless deaths and caused much harm to friends and enemies alike. But Doom convinces Bast to look further, opening himself totally to show that the ends justify the means. In countless futures viewed by Doom, humanity has destroyed itself - except one. The alternate future of Doomworld where Doom reigns supreme is the only chance to save the human race. Though Bast does not approve of Doom's methods, Doom truly believes he can be the savior of mankind, and has passed the test.

Working with the Broker, Doom begins his ritual to magically enhance the Vibranium and begin his conquest of the world. The ritual was successful and soon Doom had the power to control every bit of Vibranium on the planet and make it come to life, simultaneously attacking every country and team on Earth. Doom described the power as being even greater than when he took the Silver Surfer's Power Cosmic or when he possessed a Cosmic Cube.</p><p>The Black Panther and Shuri gathered their allies to the borders of Latveria in an attempt to draw Doom out since they dared not wage open war with Latveria. With all his power and might, Doom accepted the challenge and planned to remove his enemies once and for all. With the incredible power he possessed and an army of Doombots, Doom easily had his enemies on the edge of defeat. But the Black Panther did the unexpected. He used Doom's great power as his own power source to make all the processed Wakandan Vibranium on Earth useless, thus sacrificing the source of Wakanda's economy. Doom had been defeated and also had lost hundreds of billions of dollars in the process.</p><h3>Reborn and joining the Future Foundation</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1413125\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68218/1413125-vr_dd_we_have_a_deal_super.jpg\" title=\"The Agreement\"><img id=\"1413125\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68218/1413125-vr_dd_we_have_a_deal_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Agreement\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Agreement</div></div></div></div><p>The transfer overload to Doom damaged his brain and left him severely diminished in mental capacity. He called for <a href=\"../../kristoff-vernard/29-11829/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kristoff</a> from exile to take his place until he could find a way to return his intelligence. Meanwhile, A future version of Franklin Richards had warned <a href=\"../../valeria-richards/29-2470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valeria Richards</a> that there was an upcoming problem and that 'All Hope Lies in Doom.' The Fantastic Four had disbanded after the seeming death of the Human Torch, and so it was of the essence to bring Doom in the fold. When Valeria arrived to ask for Doom's help, she noticed that he was struggling to follow her words and she learned that he was recently brain damaged. In exchange for his help to save her father, she offered to find a way to restore his intelligence.</p><p>With the help of Mr. Fantastic (and the convincing of Nathaniel Richards), they used Kristoff as a back up to restore Doom's intelligence. As part of his bargain, he joined the Future Foundation to assist Valeria in saving the world. The threat finally emerged in the last surviving members of the <a href=\"/the-council/65-57131/\">Council</a>, an inter-dimesional gathering of all the Reed Richards' of the multiverse. Upon investigation, one Reed managed to fool Doom into allowing him to place a control collar on him, as he had done with many other alternate versions of Doom throughout the multiverse.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2266818\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79429/2266818-2266816-ff_16_panel.jpg\" title=\"Infinity Gauntlet\"><img id=\"2266818\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79429/2266818-2266816-ff_16_panel_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Infinity Gauntlet\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Infinity Gauntlet</div></div></div></div><p>Under the alternate Reed's control, they traveled to Latveria and were met by Nathaniel Richards, who helped assist them in returning to their own universe. Doom was finally released from the collar when they were all forced to stop the invasion of the <a href=\"/celestials/65-13343/\">Mad Celestials</a>, enemies of the Council bent on destroying all versions of Reed Richards. Doom stayed behind to fight off the Celestials on his own while the others escaped and tried to close the portal behind them. While it was known that Doom must die to save the Earth, Valeria told him to find a way to survive, something Doom undoubtedly meant to do in the first place.</p><p>While all believed Doom sacrificed himself for the greater good, Doom did indeed survive. Not only did he find the <a href=\"/infinity-gauntlet/18-40945/\">Infinity Gauntlet</a> of one of the expired Reed's, he also discovered their collection of lobotomized Dooms from alternate dimensions. Doom began his preparations for the future.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><b>Sorcery</b>: Doctor Doom's potential in the mystic arts comes from the Roma (i.e. Gypsies) heritage of his mother. He learned these abilities from his time with a secret order of monks in Tibet. He further developed his abilities by traveling through time and learning lost Dark Arts. Doctor Strange originally considered him magically proficient but only a mid-level mage, but now considers Doom one of the most powerful practitioners of sorcery and a potential Sorcerer Supreme. His knowledge and power is great enough to hold his own against the likes of Morgan le Fay and <a href=\"/brother-voodoo/29-10280/\">Doctor Voodoo</a>, the current Sorcerer Supreme. His knowledge of spell-craft likely surpasses Doctor Strange's, former Sorcerer Supreme. However, he considers his scientific abilities to be more important and has devices that do many of the same things.</p><p>He has displayed sorcery in the following ways:</p><p>Mystical Blasts</p><p>Mystical Force-fields</p><p>Invoke Entities</p><p>Spell Casting</p><p>Summoning</p><p>Teleportation</p><p>Dimensional Travel</p><p>Mystical Ensnaring</p><p>Mystical Portals</p><p><b>Mind Transference</b>: By training with an alien race, Doom has gained the ability to switch his mind with that of another nearby human being with whom he's made eye contact, a process which he learned from the alien <a href=\"/ovoids/65-13930/\">Ovoids</a>. However, Doom prefers his own body and only uses this transference power as a last resort.</p><p>Doom's armor also provides him with a vast array of powers. The armor itself is made of a mystical metal alloy that was crafted by the Tibetan monks. It can unleash energy blasts, missiles, lasers, as well as others forms of weaponry.</p><p><b>Genius-level Intellect</b>: Doctor Doom's most dangerous weapon is his genius-level intellect. He is easily one of the top mortal minds on the planet. Doom has constructed hundreds of devices, including a working time machine (the first of its kind on Earth), devices which can imbue people with superpowers, and many types of robots. His most frequently used robots are his \"Doombots,\" exact mechanical replicas of the real Doctor Doom. They look like him, talk like him, and even act like him. Individually, Doombots have an advanced AI (artificial intelligence) so that each one believes itself to be the real Doom. As a safety measure, each Doombot has a dampener program that is triggered whenever the real Doom (or another Doombot) is nearby. These \"body doubles\" appear when Doom cannot be present or is unwilling to risk his own life, and are often responsible for Doom's return from certain death. Another common type of robot used is the Servo-Guard, the police force of Latveria. Doom specializes in physics, robotics, cybernetics, genetics, weapons technology, biochemistry, and time travel. He also has natural talents for leadership, strategy, politics, and manipulation.</p><p><b>Superhuman Strength:</b> While in his armor, Doom can lift up to 2tons.</p><p><b>Physical Description</b></p><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 6'2\", 6'7\" (Armored)</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 225 lbs, 415 lbs (Armored)</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Brown</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Brown</li></ul><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><h3>Armor</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"614939\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30477/614939-155915_78770_doctor_doom_super_super.gif\" title=\"Doom Armor\"><img id=\"614939\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30477/614939-155915_78770_doctor_doom_super_medium.gif\" alt=\"Doom Armor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Doom Armor</div></div></div></div><p>Doom's armor contains many gadgets.

In Latveria, he turned it from a third world country into one of the richest countries of the world. Doom in this universe has actual powers: he can make porcupine-like needles and fling them at his enemies, and he can convert his innards into a toxic gas. The toxic gas is so deadly that victims break their backs in the final convulsions. His people revere him as a savior and as \"The Good doctor\". Briefly, Victor and Reed switch bodies, but Reed was able to return to his own body just in time to fight and defeat the Zombie Fantastic Four. The Zombie Fantastic Four were teleported back to their universe along with Victor, who sacrificed himself to get the zombies into the teleporter. He just wanted to be remembered as the one who saved the world, but Reed and the others did not acknowledge his request and they were subsequently recognized as the ones that saved the world. Although it was never explained Doom manages to return to the ultimate universe and makes a deal with Nick Fury to hot wire one of Reed Richard's probes that were being sent out across the N-zone to find a cure for The Things mutation. After the heroes travel to the Supreme Power universe to rescue Reed from the Squadron Supreme, Doom is shown to have traveled in secret with Nick Fury to the Supreme Power universe where he betrays Fury and begins to fight the heroes of both universes.

Mystique is one of the few bisexual characters in comics, having had a long relationship with Irene Adler, otherwise known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destiny/29-3557/\">Destiny</a>. Mystique initially met Destiny when she was hired to help her decipher her dreams and stop the worst of them from coming to pass. The two of them would eventually become life long lovers. When Mystique was involved with Destiny the two of them actively tried to thwart Destiny's negative precognitive dreams from coming to pass. The two stayed with each other for decades until Destiny was killed. Mystique has also been the mother of three known children. She is the biological mother of both <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">Graydon Creed</a>, whose father was the mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>. Ironically, Graydon turned out to be just a normal human and became the mutant- hating leader of the racist group known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/friends-of-humanity/65-40563/\">Friends of Humanity</a>. He was eventually assassinated by Mystique herself. Her third child, by adoption, was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>, who would eventually join the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> after turning her back on Mystique's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood Of Evil Mutants</a>.</p><h2>Character Creation</h2><p>Mystique's first appearance (cover) on Ms. Marvel #16 was penciled <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dave-cockrum/26-4447/\">Dave Cockrum</a> (who designed the initial look of the character) . When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a> saw Cockrum's design, he named the character 'Mystique' and, with Cockrum's permission, introduced the character into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/49-2910/\">Ms Marvel</a> comics in 1978. This issue and the first full appearance issue were both drawn by <a href=\"/jim-mooney/26-15983/\">Jim Mooney</a> who gets creator credit (see Marvel.wikia.com). Much like Herb Trimpe gets credit for Wolverine (who was designed by John Romita). Claremont stated that he originally planned to have Mystique and Destiny be Nightcrawler's biological parents, but due to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/comics-code-authority/12-42382/\">Comics Code Authority</a>, Marvel refused to do this. However, years later Mystique and Destiny were confirmed to be a couple.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"368433\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/368433-199928-get-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique and Wolverine\"><img id=\"368433\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10390/368433-199928-get-mystique_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique and Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique and Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique's age is unknown, though she is well over 100 years old. Her powers either stop her aging or more likely slow it down in the extreme. In the 1920s, Mystique met Wolverine when he joined her gang of mutant pick-pockets. This meeting was possibly orchestrated by Weapon X. The two became lovers. Wolverine did not act when Mystique let their friends die when the situation turned sour, though he was very upset. As they ran away, Mystique pushed Wolverine out of the train they were escaping on because she did not trust him.</p><p>At one point in her life, Raven and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Victor Creed</a> (Sabretooth) became \"lovers\" for a time. When the two initially met, Raven was in the disguise of Leni Zauber. Both Leni and Victor had been assigned to kill a scientist in Berlin. Although, Raven was the one who ultimately killed the scientist, the two of them still needed to keep a low profile and opted to stay in the same safe house. It was here that they first became lovers until Raven faked her death so that she could leave Sabretooth without objection. During their time together, unbeknownst to Sabretooth, they conceived a child. Raven immediately gave the child up for adoption, although she still kept track of him until he hit adolescence and it became apparent that he was not a mutant.</p><p>Later on in Mystique's life she had a son named Kurt Wagner with the ancient biblical mutant named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/azazel/29-40526/\">Azazel</a>. By this time, Mystique was calling herself Raven Darkholme--a name which might be the one she was born with. During this time Raven was married to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/christian-wagner/29-57077/\">Christian Wagner</a> and the two of them were happily married until she learned of Christian's infertility. She then used her powers to have sex with a number of partners as she desperately wanted another child. That is when she meet Azazel, who told her of the islands he ruled off the coast of Bermuda, and that he was the father of many mutants who were called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/neyaphem/65-45565/\">Neyaphem</a>.

After his father convinced him to have a blood test, Raven killed her father-in-law and buried him. She then gave birth to a baby with black hair, yellow eyes, blue skin, and a pointed tail after reverting to her true form due to the stress of the birth. The villagers thought that both the mother and child were demons and they quickly attempted to kill them. Raven soon threw her newborn son into a river before changing her form to that of a local villager so that she could escape alive.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"548956\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/548956-panel16_copy_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique abandoned her baby to escape a mob.\"><img id=\"548956\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/548956-panel16_copy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique abandoned her baby to escape a mob.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique abandoned her baby to escape a mob.</div></div></div></div><p>Distraught over what she had done, Mystique wandered the world for some time During this time, she met the mutant Destiny and became both friends and lovers with her. Destiny, who was precognitive, told Raven it would be best for her to adopt a certain child named Anna Marie (who would later grow up to become the X-Man known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>). Wanting to make up for abandoning Victor and Kurt, Mystique eagerly agreed. Mystique genuinely cared for Anna, and raised her like the child she had lost. Although, initially distrustful, Raven gained the young girls trust creating a family with her and Destiny for nearly a decade, with Raven becoming very protective over Anna. Unfortunately, Destiny aged at the rate of a normal human while Mystique retained her youthful body.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mystique's child with Sabretooth grew up to be the human known as <a>Graydon Creed</a>. This turn out angered Raven and she refused to claim him as her child. Graydon knew that both of his parents were mutants and because they left him, he began to despise all mutants.</p><p>Soon after reaching adulthood, Graydon became the leader of the mutant hating organization called the <a>Friends of Humanity</a>, before becoming a politician.

With Rogue on their team, the Brotherhood successfully defeated the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>. However, during their battle, Rogue attempted to use her absorption power on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a>. Unfortunately, Ms. Marvel did not go down easily, and Rogue was forced to absorb her psyche and powers permanently. This caused Rogue to feel as if she was going insane since Ms. Marvel's persona often attempted to gain control of Rogue's mind. With no other option, Rogue abandoned her pseudo family in order to join <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a> in hopes that he could help where her mother could not. Unfortunately, Mystique believed that Xavier had brainwashed her daughter and she attempted to liberate Rogue from the X-Men's control. This rescue mission was short lived after Rogue told Mystique that she believed Xavier was the only person in the world who could help her control her powers. Reluctantly, Raven left Rogue with the X-Men, although she still continued to check in on her from time to time. Over the years however, Mystique began to resent Xavier and the X-Men, believing that they had stolen one of the few special people in her life.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Days Of Future Past</h3><p>The group gained infamy after their failed attempt to assassinate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Robert Kelly</a> after being stopped by the X-Men.

Because of the growing anti-mutant hysteria that was spreading through America, the government accepted Raven's request under the condition that they locate and capture <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>. The team proved to be successful only because Magneto had already opted to turn himself in. As a reward for helping the government, Raven and the rest of the Brotherhood had their criminal past erased with the condition that they commit no other crime in the future. During Ravens time with the team, she helped to capture the Avengers, fought with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a> in order to arrest <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rusty-collins/29-13376/\">Rusty Collins</a>, and battled the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a> to capture both Rusty and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skids/29-3194/\">Skids</a>.

During the same battle, Mystique left <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a> in charge of Destiny, until Destiny convinced Mystique she needed her aid more. Destiny was subsequently killed and Mystique blamed and swore vengeance on Forge for her death. Mystique eventually decided to take time off for herself so that she could spread Destiny's ashes in the ocean.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"109915\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/109915-176515-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Joining X-Factor\"><img id=\"109915\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/109915-176515-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Joining X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Joining X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique grew tired and depressed without Destiny and was soon marked for death by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a>. She was soon assisted by Xavier and the X-Men before saving Xavier himself by helping to defeat the Shadow King. Unfortunately Mystique's mental condition only worsened when she was marked for death yet again. However, this time it was by her former teammate, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spiral/29-9722/\">Spiral</a>, who tracked her across the globe. Mystique was eventually saved by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> who took her back to the X-Mansion so that she could recover. In the end, Raven had a complete mental breakdown and was taken to Forge's home in Dallas. With Forge, Mystique became horrified when she discovered that her son, Graydon Creed had become the leader of an anti-mutant hate group and had hired Sabretooth to kill Mystique. However, Mystique revealed the truth about their son to Sabretooth, convincing him to go after Graydon instead. Later, when a top ranking U.S. General with ties to Graydon turned up dead, Forge realized that Mystique was to blame and was preparing her next move to kill her son. This led to Rogue and Nightcrawler's interference as they attempted to stop Raven. Nightcrawler also finally learned the truth that Mystique was indeed his mother. Although, Raven failed to kill Creed, she was presumed dead after saving Nightcrawler, when Creed attempted to murder his newly discovered brother.</p><h3>Legion Quest</h3><p>Months later, Raven returned and attempted to kill <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion/29-13349/\">Legion</a> for killing Destiny back on Muir Island. When her attempt failed, Raven began to flee from the government. Unfortunately, Forge had placed a tracking device in her head during their time together, allowing the government team, X-Factor to find and capture her. She was then forced to become a member of X-Factor, after she discovered a government plot to blow up a dam and blame it on mutants. Sabretooth was subsequently placed on the team as a sleeper agent in order to kill Raven. During her time with X-Factor, Mystique began to develop a true romantic relationship with Forge, even though he thought that she was only using him. Later it was discovered that Mystique's lover, Destiny, had given birth to children during one of the couples long separations. The children were now adults with their own children, one of whom was a mutant. Graydon had the mutant teen savagely beaten by members of the Friends of Humanity, as a warning towards his mother. Furious, Mystique began preparations to again attempt to kill her son, however she quickly decided against it when she learned that his own colleagues wanted him killed so that he could be made a martyr. Mystique reluctantly attempted to save Graydon from being assassinated, although she failed, and ultimately ushered in a new wave of anti-mutant violence.</p><h3>Operation: Zero Tolerance</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"547578\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/547578-mystique_00_super.jpg\" title=\"Searching for the Legacy Virus\"><img id=\"547578\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/10069/547578-mystique_00_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Searching for the Legacy Virus\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Searching for the Legacy Virus</div></div></div></div><p>Soon after, Sabretooth acted on his orders to kill the members of X-Factor after \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/operation-zero-tolerance/39-43899/\">Operation: Zero Tolerance</a>\" was initiated. Mystique attacked Sabretooth in time to save her defeated teammates and arranged for them to receive immediate medical attention before going on the run again. Later, Mystique started using the alias of Mallory Brickman, the wife of a US Senator. She then used her husband's status to send the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fbi/65-55443/\">FBI</a> after Sabretooth. Weeks later, Mystique infiltrated a government operated building where she attempted to gain critical intel on the identity of those responsible for her son's death and the attempt to kill her via Sabretooth. Nearing success, Mystique suddenly lost her powers and reverted to a human form before being arrested. This ultimately ruined all of Raven's hard work over the years, as the government destroyed all of her established alternate identities and denied her access to any of the money that she and Destiny had accumulated together. Mystique's relationship with Rogue also took a turn for the worse when Rogue refused to break Mystique out of jail and instead decided to join her \"second\" family by assisting the X-Men in defeating the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a>, who was responsible for the sudden loss of mutant powers. When the X-Men succeed in their mission, all mutants regained their abilities, allowing Mystique to escape from prison. Mystique was soon sent back in time by the original X-Factor's sentient ship where she discovered that her son's killer was none other than herself, and that Destiny was one of the original members of the anti-mutant conspiracy which she had been fighting for countless years now. This caused Mystique to have another mental breakdown and she became obsessed with eradicating humanity.</p><h3>Red Data/Condition Critical</h3><p>She soon developed a plan and reformed the Brotherhood of Mutants in order to steal the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legacy-virus/12-42281/\">Legacy Virus</a> from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a>. While impersonating Moira, Mystique's previous experience with bio-terrorism allowed her to use Moira's infected blood to create a weapon that would target humans rather than mutants. Raven was also able to find a cure for the human version of the Legacy Virus before destroying Moira's lab and fatally injuring the scientist. Before leaving Muir Island in the form of Moira, Raven was discovered by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Rahne Sinclaire</a>. Raven quickly shot the mutant in the chest with a gun engineered by Forge, depowering the young mutants. Rogue eventually attempted to stop her mother, but Mystique stabbed her in the stomach once she knew that Rogue would not allow her plan to be successful. Rogue survived the attack by absorbing Wolverine's healing factor and claws which she used to brutally stab Mystique in the back. Later in a hospital, Raven confessed to the X-Men that in Destiny's visions, she had seen a dark future for mutants and no matter what preventative action she took, it still seemed to unfold. Without sympathy, Mystique was sent to prison where she eventually escaped and began using <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/martinique-jason/29-15167/\">Martinique Jason</a> to control <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-corps/65-40860/\">X-Corps</a> before ruining the organization and cutting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/banshee/29-9708/\">Banshee's</a> throat, leaving him in critical condition.</p><h3>Mystique: Quiet</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"297706\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/297706-199084-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Working for Xavier\"><img id=\"297706\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/297706-199084-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Working for Xavier\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Working for Xavier</div></div></div></div><p>After being defeated again, Mystique attempted to work as a double agent for Xavier, who offered to shield Mystique from being found by the other countries she was now wanted in for her acts of terrorism. However, if she were caught, Xavier would deny ever having worked with her. Mystique was assisted on her missions with advanced technology developed by Forge, and the three inch telepathic mutant, named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shortpack/29-4280/\">Shortpack</a>, who acted as her handler. During one of her missions, an enemy of Xavier's known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steinbeck/29-4299/\">Quiet Man</a>, contacted Mystique and offered to give her an interference transmitter (the same device that Xavier used to keep her hidden from the authorities) on the condition that she kill Xavier. Mystique created a plan with Forge where she would attempt to kill Xavier, however, he would stop her at the last minute so that the Quiet Man believed that she was still working for him. Unfortunately, the X-Men believed that she had truly attempted to kill Xavier and went after her.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1213506\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1213506-140377_198577_mike_mayhew_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique and Shortpack\"><img id=\"1213506\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1213506-140377_198577_mike_mayhew_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique and Shortpack\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique and Shortpack</div></div></div></div><p>It was Rogue who eventually managed to track down Mystique and she quickly disowned her foster mother, claiming that she had simply gone too far this time. Mystique attempted to apologize for what she had done to Rogue, however, her efforts were futile as she was forced to blow up the house she was in order to escape from Rogue. Mystique then returned to the Quiet Man to gain the interference transmitter, however, the Quiet Man had already decided to kill Mystique, believing that she had outlived her usefulness. It was here that Mystique learns that the Quiet Man is in reality, Xavier's former special agent that Mystique replaced, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prudence/29-4284/\">Prudence Leighton</a>. After an ensuing fight, Mystique managed to kill the Quiet Man, rescue her former handler, Shortpack, and discover that the interference transmitter she gained had been fake all along. She soon attempted to switch Forge's real transmitter with her fake one, however, Forge angrily smashed it before telling Mystique that he never wanted to see her again. The two mutants share a final and sad good-bye kiss before Mystique leaves and Forge discovers that she had already switched his transmitter with the fake one.</p><h3>X-Men: Legacy</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"88556\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/88556-160761-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique as Foxx\"><img id=\"88556\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/88556-160761-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique as Foxx\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique as Foxx</div></div></div></div><p>After some time had passed, Mystique began to become worried about Rogue's relationship with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> and their inability to have a physical relationship. Because of this, Mystique first posed as a student at the Xavier Institute named Foxx and attempted to seduce Gambit. However, her true identity was soon discovered and she claimed that her intention was to simply test Gambit, and was only acting in Rogue's best interest. She then asked to join the team, admitting that the world was too dangerous a place for mutants to be on their own, so she sought asylum with the X-Men. Rogue was opposed to Mystique's membership, however, the team opted to allow her to join on a probationary status.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1213503\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1213503-81512_150516_x_men_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men\"><img id=\"1213503\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1213503-81512_150516_x_men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Partly due to her previous interference, Rogue and Gambit soon split up and Mystique attempted to play match maker by introducing Rogue to the mutant known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pulse/29-15257/\">Pulse</a>. This did not work out in Mystique's favor and when Rogue was assembling her strike force of X-Men she added Mystique to her team only to keep an eye on her. Mystique ultimately helped Rogue's X-Men in their missions, including in their battle against the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/children-of-the-vault/65-43765/\">Children of the Vault</a>. During her time with the X-Men, Mystique developed and consummated a brief relationship with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>. However, she later revealed herself to be a traitor when she allied with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-mastermind/29-12055/\">Lady Mastermind</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/omega-sentinel/29-3421/\">Omega Sentinel</a> (who was being possessed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/malice/29-11877/\">Malice</a>) and defected with them to join Mr. Sinister's <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a> during their attack on the X-Men. At the peak of the battle Mystique shot Rogue and subsequently abducted her, taking her to the Marauders base before giving <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> a brief warning about the future.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"556115\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27775/556115-its_not_mine_super.png\" title=\"Mystique and Gambit with the Messiah baby.\"><img id=\"556115\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27775/556115-its_not_mine_medium.png\" alt=\"Mystique and Gambit with the Messiah baby.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique and Gambit with the Messiah baby.</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique stayed with the Marauders and looked after the still injured Rogue. When Gambit and the other Marauders returned to their base on Muir Island with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baby-mutant/29-49329/\">Baby Mutant</a>, they immediately hand the child to Mr. Sinister. Sinister then tells the Marauders to leave, with the exception of Gambit, when Sinister shapeshifts into Mystique and it is revealed that she has already killed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mr. Sinister</a> after she forced him to touch Rogue's skin. She then admits that everything that she has done since joining the X-Men has been done in order to save Rogue's life after reading certain sections of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destinys-diaries/18-44250/\">Destiny's Diaries</a>, which revealed the outcome of the actions that Mystique should take. Mystique then tells Gambit that the child is required to save Rogue's life. Gambit does not understand the connection until Mystique places the child's forehead onto Rogue's lips. Gambit quickly snatches the child away and chastises Mystique, claiming that Rogue would not want to sacrifice the life of an innocent child only to save hers. Gambit soon realizes that the child is still alive, however, Mystique suddenly begins to breakdown when Rogue does not instantly wake up. Professor Xavier soon walks into the room and Gambit gives him the child for safe keeping as Rogue begins to gain consciousness. Gambit quickly tries to explain the situation, however, Rogue is still furious at her mother, and simply says that all of it has to stop. Rogue attempts to kill Mystique by touching her, believing that she is still infected by Strain-88, however it is revealed that Rogue has been completely healed and no longer has the psyche of every being she has touched residing within her. Unfortunately for her, this doesn't last long as Mystique's psychic imprint now resides within her. Rogue then leaves Mystique unconscious and heads to the Australian outback to work things out for herself.</p><h3>Get Mystique</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"333253\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/333253-59435-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Confronting Wolverine\"><img id=\"333253\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/333253-59435-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Confronting Wolverine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Confronting Wolverine</div></div></div></div><p>During the following commotion of the end battle and shooting of Xavier in <i>Messiah Complex</i>, Mystique regains consciousness and escapes from the area. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> later asked Wolverine to track down Mystique and permanently take her out. Wolverine tracks her first to Iran, then to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/afghanistan/34-55914/\">Afghanistan</a>, all the while remembering the first time they met. It turns out that both of them had previously been captured for being mutants in Mexico in 1921, and after freeing themselves, Mystique convinced Wolverine to join her group of fellow mutants in Kansas City. Wolverine agrees, however, he double crosses the group when they attempt to rob a bank by leading police to the scene. Fortunately for Mystique, she had already left before the police arrived. During the present time, Wolverine continued to track Mystique before he is ambushed. Mystique then shapeshifts into his form and proceeds to kill an unknown Afghan woman. When Wolverine finally arrives at the scene, others begin to shoot at him, allowing Mystique to escape. Later, she impersonates a nun in Baghdad, where Wolverine tracks her to a bar. After learning why Wolverine is chasing her, she escapes to another part of Iraq. She shapeshifts into the Iraqi mistress of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/senator-miles-brickman/29-2278/\">Senator Miles Brickman</a> , allowing her to kill and impersonate her former husband when he comes to visit. Wolverine finds a way to get into the military base to get close to Mystique in her Brickman disguise. When he finds her in Brickman's quarters, Wolverine calls Mystique a coward, and goads her into a fight, but she escapes yet again. Later on Wolverine tracks Mystique into the desert, and she is naked to show Wolverine that she is not a coward nor is she ashamed of herself. After some explosions and shooting, Wolverine finally gets closer to her and a fight ensues. Mystique tells him that the X-Men kept accepting her into the group only for her to betray them. She tells them that it is only her nature and that Wolverine will also betray them sooner or later. Wolverine is shot and stabbed while Mystique is stabbed with his claws multiple times. Injured, Mystique shoots Wolverine in the head which should cause him temporary brain damage as she then throws up in his face. She crawls away until Wolverine heals and awakens only to find her yet again. She tells him to just kill her but he sees that she is bleeding to death and throws her a gun, telling her that he has friends who will always come to get him, while she's alone. With that in mind, she should know what the gun is for. Mystique screams at Logan as he leaves her in the desert with the pistol.</p><h3>Manifest Destiny</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1213500\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1213500-537733_x_men_manifest_destiny_20080901011524705_super.jpg\" title=\"Manifest Destiny\"><img id=\"1213500\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1213500-537733_x_men_manifest_destiny_20080901011524705_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Manifest Destiny\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Manifest Destiny</div></div></div></div><p>It is later discovered that Mystique survived that day and has been in the form of Iceman's ex-girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/opal-tanaka/29-11577/\">Opal Tanaka</a>, having met Bobby at a party. Recently, Bobby had been experiencing difficulties with his powers. His body is in pain and always feels cold. As Opal, Mystique encourages him to call Hank. Hank advises Bobby that the problem with his powers could very well be due to the toxin Mystique slipped him, but he would need to run tests in San Fransisco to be sure. He sends the X-Jet by remote and 'Opal' insists on coming with him. During the flight she questions him about how he was infected and asks Bobby, \"I wonder if she meant for this to happen\", but he dismisses the idea that Mystique would even care. Soon after, the bomb she slipped onto the plane explodes, creating a hole in the side of the jet. She reverts back to her true form before kicking him out of the jet and to the snowy covered mountains they were flying over.</p><p>Throughout the next few days Mystique repeatedly attacks him and nearly kills him; but never finishing him off. She tells Iceman that she has never loved nor liked him. She injects him directly with another toxin, refusing to let hospital workers help him, and forcing him to cure himself with his malfunctioning powers. While Bobby hitchhiked, she attacked the semi he was riding in. Bobby traps her in ice, but she escapes when he is distracted by the semi's driver.</p><p>She is later found waiting on top of the Golden Gate Bridge, disguised as Iceman, with a pressure switch detonator in her hand to the bomb she has planted. Bobby is given permission to approach her first while the others look for the bomb. It's here the two finally have it out. He tells her that Wolverine told him what happened in their fight. Mystique admits that Logan was right about her being alone. That it sounded like the truth. Bobby tells her that he thinks she was lying earlier about not loving him. To this she has no reply. He pushes her further about how her daughter and son won't have anything to do with her. She starts to cry and demands he stop, but he just pushes harder telling her that if she would try asking someone out to dinner in place of blowing up bridges she might actually get somewhere. With her hurt, angry, and sad she is distracted enough to let Bobby freeze her hand while still holding the detonator. Her bomb has been found and the rest of the X-Men are on the way. She uses her frozen fits to knock Bobby down and tells him, she will come to see him again. Not with her body or face, but promises that he will love her. That being said, she jumps off the top of the bridge, the full seven-hundred feet; and into the San Francisco Bay. Her body is never found, but Bobby is sure she is alive and realizes he owes her thanks. In her own way she cured him of the very problem she started.</p><h3>Utopia</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1035301\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/1035301-98_percent_cacao_x_men_by_mikechoi_super.jpg\" title=\"Norman Osborn &amp; his Dark X-Men\"><img id=\"1035301\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/1035301-98_percent_cacao_x_men_by_mikechoi_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Osborn &amp; his Dark X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Norman Osborn & his Dark X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>The world wants to have birth control over mutants which is why <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammer/65-56065/\">HAMMER</a> leader, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Iron Patriot</a>, and world leader) wants to handle the affairs by creating his own mutant peace-keeping team: The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-x-men/65-56445/\">Dark X-Men</a>. This is something Professor Xavier publicly accepts, but in secret the Professor is actually Mystique under Osborn's influence. While the real Charles Xavier is being held captive and tortured in H.A.M.M.E.R.'s base. Mystique seems an unwilling participant in the Dark X-Men team. Of all the villains and heroes Osborn has collected for his various dark teams. It's Mystique that he injected with nanites. Should she step out of line he has threatened to blow her up.</p><p>Not being used as a field agent of the Dark X-Men team.

She may not be happy to be on this leash, but she does see why he feels it's needed. It's later revealed that Norman Osborn has placed nanites in her nervous system, so that if Mystique disobeys Norman, he'll blow her up.

Severing her allegiance with Daken, Mystique intercepts an attempt on Logan's current girlfriend <a href=\"/melita-garner/29-63164/\">Melita</a>'s life and drives away with her on a motorcycle. En route to the site where Logan was first banished to hell, Melita bickers with Mystique and threatens to call the X-men, she then attempts to call Logan's friend <a href=\"/yukio/29-9843/\">Yukio</a> only to witness her death by a possessed Logan on the other end of the line. Mystique then explains that she still is deeply resentful of Logan and that she even played a hand in sending him to hell but claims she simply can't go through with it, when Melita asks why she merely responds \"I have my reasons\". The Ghost Riders (<a href=\"/dan-ketch/29-14719/\">Dan Ketch</a> and <a href=\"/johnny-blaze/29-6108/\">Johnny Blaze</a>) and <a href=\"/hellstorm/29-14695/\">Hellstorm</a> then aid Melita and Mystique in saving Logan's soul from hell.</p><p>Mystique leaves during the ritual and once back to normal, Logan comes after her for having a hand in his possession. The Red Right Hand also sends <a href=\"/lord-deathstrike/29-78027/\">Lord Deathstrike</a> to kill Mystique for her betrayal. Raven calls Logan from a nearby rooftop to warn him of going after the Red Right Hand but he ignores her. Mystique is shot by an exploding sniper round by Lord Deathstrike who chases after her. While riding away on a motorcycle, Logan catches up to her in a car and the three converge in a bloody battle on the streets. It is Wolverine who ultimately kills Mystique and leaves her body in the streets.

She can cause herself to look and sound exactly like any human, humanoid, or semi-humanoid being of either sex, wearing virtually any kind of clothing and accessory (even glasses). As such, she almost never wears clothes of her own since she prefers to mimic clothing. Her control is so exact that she can precisely duplicate another person's retina pattern in her own eyes, finger, palm and skin-pore patterns on her own hands and skin, and vocal cords to match voices to the point of deceiving vocal recognition software. She is also able to shift the placement of vital organs in her body to avoid damage from lacerations and punctures (notably gunfire). She also possesses a retarded aging process, if she ages at all; she is over 100 years old. As a result of exposure to unknown extraterrestrial radiation her abilities enhanced; She now possesses a healing factor (which grants her a great tolerance for toxins), enhanced strength, and augmented shapeshifting powers. She has been shown growing wings (enabling flight), shifting her abdomen to conceal small firearms, growing extra limbs, changing her mass to become a small child and flattening her body (strikingly similar to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>).</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"186380\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/186380-72319-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"New Shapeshifting Powers\"><img id=\"186380\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/308/186380-72319-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"New Shapeshifting Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">New Shapeshifting Powers</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique was limited only by her inability to diminish or increase her own mass. As a result, while she could make herself look exactly like a person who was physically bigger than herself, she would not weigh as much as the actual person that she was imitating. Although she could maintain the form of another person of similar height, weight, and build indefinitely (as with her own appearance as Raven Darkholme), the longer she maintained that form, the greater the strain she felt. If she maintained a bigger form for too long a period, the length of which is directly proportional to the difference in size between that form and her normal one, she would collapse and revert to her normal appearance. However recently she has stated that her mass can change when she does, possibly a result of her enhancement.</p><p>Mystique also cannot duplicate the powers of the person she imitates: for example, when she turned herself into a duplicate of Nightcrawler, she did not gain his ability to teleport. As of yet Mystique has not demonstrated any ability to adopt the form of non-humanoid beings, animals, plants, or non-living objects, it is conjectured that she cannot imitate any of these without interfering with the proper functioning of her internal organs and possibly causing her death. The truth however, like much regarding Mystique, remains unclear. However, she has on occasion, adapted fins for swimming, and even wings for hang-gliding. She is a good hand to hand combatant and skilled marksman.</p><p>Over the centuries, Mystique has become so adapt at imitation that she can usually tell if someone is pretending to be someone else just by their body language.

She is later replaced by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a> and Stacy X.

She then had a relationship with a baron but ended after the discovery of her newly born son's mutantcy. Mystique is the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants. She is Rogue's foster mother who trained her after she left her family. She also instructed Rogue on how to absorb Ms. Marvel's abilities. For her to have Rogue back from the X-Men, she disguised as Rogue making the situations more complicated for her. She then became a close ally of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/apocalypse/29-7612/\">Apocalypse</a>. Nightcrawler also seeks for her to define the real reason for her leaving him. Despite her son's love, she declined him and told him that she hasn't loved Nightcrawler since, he was the reason of the Baron for abandoning her.

After being exposed to Magneto's power enhancing machine, she could shapeshift not only into humans, but also animals, change her scent and become immune to telepathy. After bringing Apocalypse back, she was turned into stone. Her stone form was taken by the brotherhood, but Nightcrawler took the statue back to the mansion. Rogue pushed her statue off a cliff in anger and it seemed to be the end of Mystique. In season four, she returned as a horseman of Apocalypse, with her powers greatly enhanced. She appeared to be invulnerable and could transform into multiple beings and objects. She seemingly became normal again after Apocalypse's defeat.</p><h3>Wolverine And The X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"766318\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35376/766318-m_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine and the X-Men\"><img id=\"766318\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35376/766318-m_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine and the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine and the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique works for Magneto, despite having a past with Wolverine. She first appeared infiltrating the mansion in an attempt to discover if the Professor had regained consciousness. She fought with Wolverine and hinted that he should remember her. As she fled the mansion defeated, she discovered Nightcrawler who had teleported his way across the ocean from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>. As Nightcrawler was attempting to alert the X-Men of Magneto's plans she knocked him out and and returned him to incarceration in Genosha. She was later seen breaking into the MRD in order to locate and free a dangerous young mutant.</p><p>Mystique appeared later to help Wolverine liberate Christie Nord, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maverick/29-8307/\"><b>Maverick's</b></a> daughter. Wolverine slowly recalled memories where he saved Mystique from being enhanced by the Weapon X program. They were attacked by Sabretooth during their escape. Wolverine told her to run and that he would find her. After the memories returned, Wolverine approached Mystique to apologize and ask for details of his past. However, she refused to say anything since the man she loved would never return.</p><p>As with all incarnations of Mystique, she is a blue-skinned metamorph with red hair. Her eyes are yellow and she still wears the skull at the parting of her hair, and prefers to wear skin-tight white trousers and a top, instead of the naked rendition from the movies. Her power to reproduce the anatomy of others is so detailed that she can fool the retina scans of the MRD. Yet she also seems able to reproduce powers, or at least has mimicked Wolverine's heightened sense of smell. If she is able to reproduce other mutant's powers, and given that she has a history with Weapon X, then it would seem that her powers and past are a combination of the traditional Mystique of regular continuity and that of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/copycat/29-13311/\">Copycat.</a></p><h3><b>Superhero Squad Show</b></h3><p>Mystique appeared in the Superhero Squad Show impersonating Black Widow to gain access to the helicarrier and eventually the SHIELD headquarters in order to steal the infinity fractals secured there. In a fight with Iron Man she used her Black Widow form to convince the other squad members to attack him saying he is the impostor. She is revealed to the heroes when she is struck in the head with Thor's hammer, causing her powers to go crazy and making her take on mixed-mated forms of other heroes/villains (such as using Modok's head and abomination's legs). When she regains her senses, she traps the squad heroes in a force field as Doom arrives. however, the villainess Screaming Mimi was really the SHIELD agent Songbird in disguise and helped free the heroes. Mystique was then arrested by SHIELD and has not been seen in season one since. While disguised as Black Widow, nearly all the squad members were showing romantic feelings for her, giving her a multitude of chocolates and flowers and Tony even asking her out to an Italian restaurant. During her fight with Tony, she did reveal she likes Italian food. Her appearance is her comic book form, although a more cartoony style to match the rest of the series. Also in this episode, she takes on the forms of Iron Man (complete with his suit's features), Falcon, Silver Surfer (complete with the board, although unable to stand on it), Thor, Captain America, and even Hulk (although this made her seriously clumsy due to not being used to Hulk's size and weight, although Wolverine jokes the stumbling is an improvement). It is unknown if she will appear in season two.</p><h2>Movies</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"109876\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/109876-65056-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Rebecca Romijn\"><img id=\"109876\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3133/109876-65056-mystique_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Romijn\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rebecca Romijn</div></div></div></div><p>In the films Mystique has scaly skin and reptilian eyes. She can transform into humans, animals and, has also demonstrated that she can turn into a humanoid statue. She was also able to grow claws, and may have a healing factor (though she still retains scars, perhaps by choice). She is able to mimic retinal patterns and fingerprints exactly. She also is a highly agile and expert fighter seemingly better than Wolverine. Although she is naked through out the films, she looks as if she is clothed.</p><h3>X-Men</h3><p>Mystique abducts Senator Kelly in the film after taking the form of his personal aide, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Gyrich</a>, before revealing her true form and knocking him unconscious. Near the end of the film, on Liberty Island, Mystique mimics a stone statue and assaults Wolverine. Although Wolverine possesses superior strength, Mystique uses her superior speed and dexterity to outwit him before leaving the area by climbing upside-down on a pipe. She later over estimates her abilities when she takes Storm's form while attempting to trick Wolverine. He quickly sees through her guise and stabs her in the stomach. When authorities arrive, she takes the form of a police officer allowing her to receive medical aid. She is then seen at the end of the movie to have successfully taken the place of the deceased Senator Kelly.</p><h3>X2: X-Men United</h3><p>Because of her further impersonation of Senator Kelly, Mystique is able to find information on classified government information, which holds the location and information on Magneto's prison. Mystique helps to break him out by injecting a guard with iron-bearing fluid. She later attempts to seduce Wolverine by pretending to be Jean Grey after she and Magneto join forces with the X-Men to help defeat William Stryker. At the end of the movie, both she and Magneto escape Alkali Lake after setting into motion an event that could cause the destruction of humanity.</p><h3>X-Men 3: The Last Stand</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"809354\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36630/809354-x3_0740_super.jpg\" title=\"Depowered\"><img id=\"809354\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36630/809354-x3_0740_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Depowered\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Depowered</div></div></div></div><p>In the beginning of the film, Mystique is captured by the government. It is here that they reveal that her true name is Raven Darkholme, although she refuses to answer to her \"slave name\" ever since her family tried to kill her. She is later freed by Magneto but was shot with the mutant \"cure\" and turns her into a human. Magneto then abandons her, saying that she is no longer one of them anymore. She gives the government information on Magneto's whereabouts. However, when soldiers reach the base, they find <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madrox/29-7910/\">Multiple Man's</a> decoys. It is unknown if this was all part of Magneto's plan or if she truly did it out of anger. It is also not known whether her powers returned or not, as Magneto's seem to begin returning at the film's end.</p><h3>X-Men: First Class</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1831228\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/17981/1831228-mystique_super.jpg\" title=\"Mystique\"><img id=\"1831228\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/17981/1831228-mystique_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mystique\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mystique</div></div></div></div><p>Mystique appears in the first prequel movie and is been portrayed by the actress, Jennifer Lawrence. Here she was first depicted as being a runaway child who broke into Charles Xavier's house to feed herself, and shapeshifted into his mother, only to be found out to be an imposter via his strong telepathic abilities.</p><p>Apparently she ended up living with him, as the two grew up, and they became as close as brother and sister. Mystique was in a shapeshifted 'normal' looking human form throughout most of the movie, as she could not accept her own appearance, however that all started to change when she met Magneto. As with the first three films, the two had great chemistry, and he became a mentor to her, as well as what appears to be a lover after a scene in the film depicts them making love.</p><p>When the X-Men go to Cuba to stop the war between The United States and The Soviet Union, Mystique was ordered to stay in the fallen jet and to keep it safe from intruders. She eventually did this by ordering Azazel to stop what he was doing in the form of Sebastian Shaw, only for Beast to be able to knock him out. By the end of the film, after Charles Xavier is shot and paralyzed, he tells Mystique to go with Magneto, as that is what she truly wants. And so she goes.</p><p>It should be noted, that just like in the second movie when hers and Nightcrawler's relationship with one another was not brought up, neither were hers and Azazel's in this movie.</p><h2><b>Video Games</b></h2><h3><b>X-Men: Arcade Game</b></h3><p>Mystique first appeared in disguise of Professor Xavier between the 5th and 6th stages of the game.

His parents abandoned him almost immediately. He lived for a few years in an orphanage, where cruel boys teased and tormented him on account of his ugliness and misshapen body. Despite being rather intelligent, his appearance, extreme shyness and slight learning disability led most to believe him to be slow. Mortimer dropped out of the orphanage prematurely, opting to live on the streets and fend for himself rather than face the abuse from the other boys. The constant fear and hatred exhibited by everyone he knew caused him to develop a severe inferiority complex. This caused Mortimer early on to show almost absolute devotion to anyone who shows him the slightest amount of affection or respect.</p><p>As Toad, he became a member of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>\u2019s original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\">Brotherhood of Evil Mutants</a>, along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mastermind/29-8306/\">Mastermind</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quicksilver/29-1467/\">Quicksilver</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>, whom Toad professes to love. This lead to a constant hostility between Toad and Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch\u2019s overprotective brother. Toad was completely devoted to Magneto, presumably the only reason being Magneto took him in as a fellow mutant. However, Toad believes Magneto truly loves him, but in reality Magneto sees him as pitiful, stupid and nothing more than a pawn to be traded when necessary.</p><p><b>The 198</b></p><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> event, Scarlet Witch has a complete mental breakdown and, losing her mind and control of her powers, alters all reality into an ideal fantasy world. She eventually changes it back, genetically altering almost all of the world\u2019s mutant population. Most are depowered, in fact only an estimated 198 keep their powers (Toad is one of these 198). Soon after rescuing the mutant Lorelei from an anti-mutant mob, he leads her to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\">Xavier Institute</a> which has become a sanctuary of sorts for all remaining mutants. He stayed on at the Institute, and found himself sharing a tent with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fever-pitch/29-15322/\">Fever Pitch</a>. He commonly voices his resentment of the <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinel</a> guards watching the mutants at the Institute.</p><p><b>Civil War</b></p><p>Along with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caliban/29-9637/\">Caliban</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/domino/29-2161/\">Domino</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shatterstar/29-2156/\">Shatterstar</a>, Toad led a group of mutants to break out of the 198 camp, and lead them to what they believed was an old abandoned nuclear bunker in the deserts of Nevada. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> soon engaged the ONE outside the bunker. Meanwhile, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/general-demetrius-lazer/29-48188/\">General Lazer</a> instructed mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/johnny-dee/29-40785/\">Johnny Dee</a> to create havoc among the 198 escapees inside the bunker. Johnny took control of the mutant Outlaw and forced him to shoot at Domino. The mutants realized Outlaw\u2019s possession in time, however, and Domino was able to use her power to cause a misfire. Toad took this opportunity to take Outlaw out so he could not harm anyone else.

He was seen in the city\u2019s riots and was injured in the chaos. Trance and Dragoness are seen trying to carry him to safety, but are slowed when H.A.M.M.E.R. soldiers start chasing them. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> rescued the three from the soldiers.</p><h4>Regensis</h4><p>After <a href=\"/schism/39-56404/\">Schism</a>, Toad begged <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> to let him go with the group of mutants that was going to go to <a href=\"/westchester-county/34-57611/\">Westchester</a>. And now he is part of <a href=\"/jean-grey-school-for-higher-learning/34-57624/\">Jean Grey School for Higher Learning</a> as Janitor.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As his name implies, Toad possesses almost all the traits and abilities of a toad, most notably his superhuman jumping and leaping abilities. When originally introduced, this is the only ability that is revealed to us, and quite possibly the only one he possessed. Because of this skill, Toad usually travels by jumping rather than walking, even when traveling short distances. The popularity of the more skilled version of Toad in the X-Men movie caused most versions of Toad to take on his other abilities and skilled combat as well. He has recently developed a style of combat all his own, incorporating his agility and leg strength. Before this, his only attacks were random strikes which usually missed their mark.</p><p>The most powerful muscles in Toad\u2019s body are his legs and his tongue. The tongue has been extended to a maximum of approximately 25 feet long. Toad uses his long, powerful tongue to lash out at high speeds or to constrict people like a boa constrictor. His tongue is strong enough to completely crush someone in a matter of seconds. On a slightly more disgusting note, Toad also uses his tongue\u2019s whip-like abilities to catch flighted insects out of the air and eat them. Also, the tip of his tongue secretes a mind controlling pheromone that begins to work as soon as it contacts the skin.</p><p>Toad\u2019s body also secretes a quick drying adhesive that he spits at his opponents. It wraps around them and dries instantly, incapacitating them unless they can break free. On command, his hands and feet can ooze a sticky solution that allows him to stick to and climb up walls and ceilings. The solution also doubles as a paralytic toxin that numbs or paralyzes a victim\u2019s whole body. An awful side affect of his chemical-secreting talents is a chemical imbalance that leads to unstable, often just strange behavior. He has a habit of rarely bathing and this, plus his secretions, gives him a strong, foul smell, which does not help people look past his appearance.</p><p>Due to his most recent mutation, Toad has gained two abilities: the ability to control amphibians, and the lung power to create and blast oxygen from them with enough strength to knock someone down from several feet away. Unfortunately, these powers recently decreased and faded completely.</p><h3>Appearances</h3><p>Toad was one of the regulars in X-Men: the 198, however his appearances in other X-Men stories are scarce and usually far apart.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Earth 295 - Age of apocalypse</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1761269\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1761269-toad_super.jpg\" title=\"Age of apocalypse\"><img id=\"1761269\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1761269-toad_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Age of apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Age of apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>In the <a href=\"/age-of-apocalypse/39-40752/\">Age of Apocalypse</a> reality Toad is a highly talented Shakespearean actor and master swordsman.

Cyclops and Toad soon visit the Morlocks and offer to take any of them who desire back to the school, and tell them of its new operation. Sunder, the leader of the Morlocks, had previously taken in Nightcrawler, but sees the appearances of so many \u2018surface dwellers\u2019 as more than coincidence. He believes all three are working against the Morlocks and takes Toad and Nightcrawler captive.

He is played by Ray Park, who had previously been mostly a stuntman. His first and only pertinent role before Toad was Darth Maul in Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Toad possesses his leaping ability, wall clinging, increased agility, dexterity, reflexes, coordination, balance, and his trademark 13-foot prehensile tongue, as well as his sticky mucus with which he nearly suffocates Jean Grey. He is portrayed as a master combatant and uses a long metal pole as a weapon when battling the X-Men in the Statue of Liberty. He actually bests Jean and Cyclops, before Storm blows him off the platform. He grabs it with his tongue, but she electrocutes him, making the popular joke, \u201cYou know what happens to a toad when it\u2019s struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else.\u201d It is implied that he died from the electrocution or hitting the water.</p><p>Although some fans believed they saw him stick to a wall in the third film, this was actually Anole, another green, wall-crawling mutant.</p><p>It has also been proposed that Toad appeared briefly in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Near the end in Stryker\u2019s island prison several mutant prisoners are seen.

He also is not the clingy, henchman type, rather the shiftless,\nself-interested, ratty looking typical teenager. Todd is a 17 year old attendee\nof Bayville High and is the first member of Mystique\u2019s brotherhood. He teams up\nwith teen versions of Blob, Quicksilver, Avalanche (who is a field leader of\nsorts), and later Scarlet Witch. He hopelessly fell for Wanda and tried in many\noccasions to get her heart, there is even a full episode dedicated to this (The\nToad, the Witch and the Wardrobe). From the first episode on he had a\nrivalry with Nightcrawler. When Apocalypse surfaces, all the Brotherhood\nrefuses to join the battle except for Scarlet Witch, however they reluctantly\nfollowed out of concern for their teammates safety.</p><p><b>Wolverine and the X-Men</b></p><p>This Toad is often captured by the MRD, and even threatens the arresting officers that the Brotherhood will come to his rescue. They do so and rescue their bumbling teammate. When Rogue pretends to join the Brotherhood, she is irritated by Toad\u2019s attitude and by his tongue constantly waving around, so she removes a glove and grabs it out of the air, temporarily absorbing his powers and knocking him out cold.

Medic <a href=\"/una-the-medic/29-60450/\">Una</a> protested this command\nis against protocol but Mar-Vell tells his beloved that <a href=\"/yon-rogg/29-6094/\">Yon-Rogg</a> is trying to\nkeep them apart as he too is in love with her. After landing on Earth, Mar-Vell\nreached The Cape where his presence was detected due to the radiation in his\nKree battle suit. Soldiers were sent after him but Mar-Vell managed to escape\nusing a combination of advanced Kree technology and the heightened physical\nabilities he gained due to Earth\u2019s lower gravity compared to his homeland.\nShortly afterwards Mar-Vell checked into a hotel in disguise and while in his\nroom, Yon-Rogg attached a wrist monitor on Mar-Vell\u2019s arm, allowing his every\nmove to be tracked. Mar-Vell then received a transmission from Kree Imperial\nMinister <a href=\"/zarek/29-44690/\">Zarek</a> telling him he must succeed or die!</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2491791\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2491791-marvel_super_heroes__12.jpg\" title=\"Captain Marvel and Carol Danvers meet for the first time at The Cape\"><img id=\"2491791\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2491791-marvel_super_heroes__12_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Captain Marvel and Carol Danvers meet for the first time at The Cape\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Captain Marvel and Carol Danvers meet for the first time at The Cape</div></div></div></div><p>Mar-Vell\nthen finished converting his <a href=\"/captain-marvels-uni-beam/18-57136/\">Uni-Beam</a> into a wrist blaster and headed back to\nthe <a href=\"/kree-helion/18-57154/\">Helion</a> but on his way, Colonel Yon-Rogg attempted to assassinate his rival\nby appearing to \u201caccidentally\u201d activate the ship\u2019s laser beams. The beams\ninstead hit a small private plane and when Mar-Vell went to its aid he found\nthe dead pilot the only one on board. The pilot\u2019s identification showed Walter\nLawson was a scientist that had just been reassigned to the nearby military\nbase. Seeing this opportunity, Mar-Vell altered Lawson\u2019s ID and took his place\nin order to further his mission on <a href=\"/earth/34-57183/\">Earth</a>. Mar-Vell\narrived at The Cape military base under the guise of Dr. Walter Lawson and began\nhis new job on Earth. Head of Security <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a> expressed her suspicions\nof Dr. Lawson as his credentials hadn\u2019t been fully cleared. Nonetheless The\nCape\u2019s Commander, <a href=\"/general-bridges/29-83641/\">General Bridges</a>, showed Lawson a dormant <a href=\"/kree-sentry/65-59067/\">Kree Sentry</a> they had\nrecovered after it was defeated by <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">The Fantastic Four</a>.

The Sentry started attacking the base and personnel within, when Captain Mar-Vell arrived\nand announced his <a href=\"/kree-empire/65-7588/\">Kree</a> military rank. However based on its original orders, the\nSentry didn\u2019t stand down and an explosive battle began. A nearby soldier thought he overheard the Man of Kree call himself Captain \u201cMarvel\u201d and thus it becomes Mar-Vell\u2019s superhero name on\nEarth. During\nthe battle, Yon-Rogg viewed the events from the <a href=\"/kree-helion/18-57154/\">Helion</a> sure his rival will be\nkilled allowing him to win the heart of <a href=\"/una-the-medic/29-60450/\">Una</a>. Meanwhile Carol Danvers got trapped near The Sentry\nforcing General Bridges to call off air support as Mar-Vell and Danvers were\ntoo close to the target. Following a lengthy battle Captain Marvel was\nultimately victorious but Yon-Rogg reported him as a traitor to <a href=\"/ronan/29-4818/\">Ronan</a> for\ndefending the humans against a Kree Sentry.

The Supreme Intelligence, the overall ruler of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree/65-7588/\">Kree</a> Empire (the conscious collective of all the greatest Kree military minds of years past) seeing Mar-Vell as both a threat and a hero, awarded Mar-Vell a new unique uniform, and \"allowed\" him to keep him his new abilities, yet banishing him simultaneously.</p><p>Mar-Vell became trapped in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">Negative Zone</a>, his only chance of freedom was for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rick-jones/29-2248/\">Rick Jones</a> to put on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nega-bands/18-42360/\">Nega-Bands</a> and slam them together. He would appear in hologram illusions to lead Rick to the nega bands on Earth that would set Captain Marvel free. By clanging the bands together, Mar-Vell, Captain Marvel, and Rick Jones would switch places.</p><p>This would base a lot of the switching places aspects of two conscious entities that can communicate with each other in comics as evidenced in later works of Firestorm and Genis-Vell, as opposed to the Shazam aspect.</p><p>A slight homage to Fawcett's Captain Marvel would be portrayed here by the great Roy Thomas and Gil Kane, although Mar-Vell remained unique and original, and with the new uniform and direction was capable of being a flagship character for Marvel Comics.</p><p>DC would retaliate by gaining the rights of the same Captain Marvel (Shazam) that they had sued for copyright infringement on Superman (and won).</p><p>However, Mar-Vell remained his own unique character.</p><p>About this time, Yon-Rogg kidnapped Carol Danvers, but was defeated by Mar-Vell, and his revenge for the death of Medic Una, his first love. Using the Psyche-Magnitron (and it's funny to have to keep editing this when what I say is true), the warrior hero known as Mar-Vell, for the first time, showed signs of denying his killer side for his romantic one and having to balance the two. Mar-Vell, as much hatred as he felt for Yon-Rogg, as demonstrated in the beating he gave him, had to decide which life to save, Carol, his new love? or Yon-Rogg? The answer was obvious.</p><p>Yon-Rogg was killed in the explosion, that Mar-Vell rescued Carol Danvers from. However, during this explosion Mar-Vell's dna was absorbed into Carol's body, thus eventually giving birth to Ms. Marvel, another in the long line of legacy characters from this...the most underutilized superhero, arguably, perhaps, in the genre abroad.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"758712\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/758712-avengers106_03_super.jpg\" title=\"Rick Jones Captain Marvel\"><img id=\"758712\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/758712-avengers106_03_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Rick Jones Captain Marvel\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Rick Jones Captain Marvel</div></div></div></div><p>After many adventures, Mar-Vell got the idea to use <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>'s portal to the Negative Zone to bring Rick Jones out. This led to a brief battle with Annihilus. By doing this the two were both able to be side by side on Earth, which would later be an opportunity to explore the Mar-Vell character as it's own separate entity, due to the circumstances, this would not be until later in the story.</p><p>Shortly after, Rick Jones and Mar-Vell were stuck in the middle of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kree-skrull-war/39-55742/\">Kree/Skrull War</a> alongside the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>.</p><p>The Avengers search for Captain Marvel and eventually locate him.

Mar-Vell ends-up in the hospital. The Kree Sentry pays a visit to Captain Marvel at the hospital. Good thing that Vision, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch are there to try to protect him, but that slick Kree Sentry teleports away with Mar-Vell anyways.</p><p>Captain Marvel, Rick Jones would confront Ronan and the Kree Sentry on a remote island. When they come back home, the Alien Activities Commission is searching for aliens, the Avengers fearing Mar-Vell's safety tell him and Carol Danvers to go into hiding.</p><p>Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers, and two Avengers are kidnapped by the Skrulls. Carol Danvers ends up being <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-skrull/29-21332/\">Super-Skrull</a> who used his shape shifter abilities. Super Skrull is now holding Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Captain Marvel hostage and plans to deliver them to the Skrull Emperor, however not before destroying another obstacle in their way of domination: The Hidden City of the Inhumans. Although the Vision interferes with this attempt, the Hidden City has defenses that protect it from the Super Skrulls attack. Realizing that his powers are no match for the Super Skrull, the Vision leaves so as not to risk the lives of those he plans to save. Taken back to the Skrull home world, the Super Skrull arrives and fights his way to the throne room of the Emperor to deliver his prisoners. There they force Mar-Vell to agree to build an Omni-Wave device for them when they threaten to destroy Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Mar-Vell agrees and the two mutants are spared.</p><p>This is where Skrull Princess <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anelle/29-29217/\">Anelle</a> would have an affair with Mar-Vell and Hulkling would be conceived. While he was building the Omni-Wave for the Skrulls.</p><p>While working on the Omni-Wave, Mar-Vell was actually building a device to cast a holographic illusion of himself, and he begins fighting to free himself and his friends from the Skrulls.</p><p>After being rescued by the Avengers they head over to the Kree Empire to save Rick Jones from Ronan.</p><p>The Supreme Intelligence released the potential that Rick Jones had in him. Using this power Jones was able to stop the war by himself. But due to this Rick Jones was dying and the only way to save him was for Mar-Vell and him to share the bond they once had. But after awhile Rick Jones could no longer contain this bond. But his girlfriend's uncle was able to use a photonic energy on Jones. After this they were able to keep switching places and Mar-Vell could absorb solar energy and use it to fire blast and increase his strength.</p><h3>Protector of the Universe</h3><p>Mar-Vell would be the first hero to stand against and ultimately defeat the alien and mad titan <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> who had acquired \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cosmic-cube/18-40949/\">The Cosmic Cube</a>\" (an all powerful cosmic weapon, similar to the \"Infinity Gauntlet\" Thanos acquired in later years, almost an identical concept with a bigger stage of promotion) to simply murder the universe for his love of death itself.</p><p>This theme would later be redone with other characters such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-warlock/29-6805/\">Warlock</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a> in Mar-Vell's original role. However, these characters would not enjoy the same crossover appeal from readers of the regular \"Earth based\" as well as the \"Cosmic\" genres of Comics, respectively, as Mar-Vell is the original. This is difficult to gauge due to Mar-Vell being killed off perhaps too early in comics.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"299434\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/299434-67481-captain-marvel_super.jpg\" title=\"Infinity Mar-Vell?

ISAAC, the worldwide computer system of Titan, in it's singular form, acknowledged that Mar-Vell would be the only one with any chance of defeating Thanos, estimating the possibility of his success at a mere .04% chance.</p><p>This is when the being known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eon/29-13348/\">Eon</a>, who came to Mar-Vell and gave him a choice of which side of his future he would embrace in order to defeat Thanos, the protector or the warrior. Mar-Vell was then appointed The \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/protector-of-the-universe/12-55736/\">Protector of the Universe</a>\" and was granted his \"cosmic awareness\", making him \"one with the universe itself\".</p><p>After this Mar-Vell became the driving force in stopping Thanos in the first Cosmic Cube saga, eventually defeating him by shattering the cosmic cube itself. Rick Jones and Mar-Vell were once again able to break the bond they share although they needed to do it every once in awhile to restore Mar-Vell's powers to its fullest.</p><p>When Commander <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zarek/29-44690/\">Zarek</a> commanded the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lunatic-legion/65-55734/\">Lunatic Legion</a>, he ordered <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a> to steal a canister of Nerve Gas called Compound 13. Mar-Vell stopped Nitro and was able to close the canister before anyone else was exposed to the gas. Although he didn't realize it at the time, Mar-Vell had been exposed to the gas himself, which would later have grave consequences.</p><p>Mar-Vell later would defeat the Lunatic Legion and went back to the Kree Homeworld to tell the Supreme Intelligence of their plans. The Supreme Intelligence once again knew of the enemy plots, and said that he had chosen Mar-Vell for his genetic make-up and Rick Jones for his psychic potential. This is when the Supreme Intelligence tried to absorb Jones's and Mar-Vell's brains, but Mar-Vell and Rick Jones were able to fight it and Mar-vell left the Kree Empire for good. Mar-Vell would often team-up with the Avengers and Fantastic Four.</p><p>In Captain Marvel #50, after teaming up with, and leading The Avengers and defeating the Super-Adaptoid, a being who cloned all of the prominent Avengers powers and weapons, including Mar-Vell's own nega bands, Mar-Vell would be able to free both himself and Rick Jones from the negative zone permanently so both would be able to be separate and free from switching atoms in Captain Marvel #50.</p><p>He would team with Drax the Destroyer in this period and due to the waning post-Starlin era (#37-#49) his series would be canceled at #62, despite the series showing promise of pursuing Captain Marvel as his own separate entity, even winning an Eagle Award in 1979 for best continuing story.</p><p>As the aforementioned change in Marvel editorial took place, between the Roy Thomas and Jim Shooter eras, <em>Captain Marvel</em> was canceled as of issue #62, and continued in <em>Marvel Spotlight #1-3, d</em>espite the progress being made with the character. Herein, the general point missed by many is that after the Jones separation the character was onto bigger and better things.</p><p>As the character was finally getting it's footing, the decision was made to kill a character for the new prestige format known as the \"Graphic Novel\".</p><p>The cover of the proposed <em>Captain Marvel #63</em>, is featured on the cover of <em>Comic Reader #169</em> in June of 1979, suggesting a contingency to not go through with killing the character. It could be rationalized that Marvel made a mistake here.</p><h3>Death of Captain Marvel</h3><p>The Nerve Gas that Mar-Vell had been exposed to during his battle with Nitro began to take a toll on his body. He slowly developed cancer, and when he no longer had the strength to carry on, he</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"114371\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/114371-142306-captain-marvel_super.JPG\" title=\"In Death's Arms\"><img id=\"114371\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/114371-142306-captain-marvel_thumb.JPG\" alt=\"In Death's Arms\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">In Death's Arms</div></div></div></div><p>went to Titan, where he spent his last remaining days. He was visited by many of the Marvel universes greatest heroes, most of whom looked to him for inspiration. Mar-Vell led the life of a great warrior. He battled many powerful enemies, and truly made the universe a better place. In the end, there was no grand battle, he did not die in the midst of a great explosion; the warrior's death that he, more than so many, deserved was stolen from him by what his people call the \"Black Death\", and he passed from the world in silence. After his death, Mar-Vell was made an honorary Avenger, and the Kree government finally acknowledged him not as a traitor, but as a great hero of their people.</p><p>A plot hole was left open as Mar-Vell's spirit form was <u>separated</u> from his body in <i>Marvel Graphic Novel #1 \"The Death of Captain Marvel\",</i> this was made apparent just as Mar-Vell's physical body on our realm of existence fell into coma.</p><p>Marvel's \"The Death of Captain Marvel\" is one of the more widely respected comics of it's time.</p><p>Despite a continued interest and mailing campaign by fans, only time will tell if Marvel will bring back the original Mar-Vell, Captain Marvel.</p><h3>The Return?</h3><p>In February of 2007, Marvel would release a one shot issue called \"The Return\" in their Civil War story arc, with Captain Marvel's symbol on the cover, this would sell 125, 707* comics being the #2 issue of the month, and an announced <em>\"Coming soon: Captain Marvel #1\"</em> teaser was put in the last page, in a book that had a Sentry story as well for whatever reason.</p><p>For the character page of the Skrull-Sleeper agent see: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/khnnr/29-56978/\">Khn'nr</a>.</p><p>Some readers of a new generation see this hint at a possible Mar-Vell return as a rallying battle-cry of sorts, in comics Mar-Vell would be a man out of his own time in this story, however the storyline was bailed out on, for reasons unknown.</p><p>However, despite the \"buzz\" of a new generation of comic readers, Mar-Vell would only be in one panel of the final Civil War issue. Nearly an entire year later, Captain Marvel #1 was released with Brian Reed, Lee Weeks and Ed McGuinness on the creative team, and it being a 5 issue limited series.</p><p>Amazingly, <em>Captain Marvel</em> would sell 203, 031 units, and go to second printings on issues before the Secret Invasion tie-in (the next coming major Marvel storyline). Mar-Vell would fight real evils of the world such as war, famine, death and the like, as opposed to \"guys in silly costumes\". He would travel from America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the world over, all of which shown in only a few brief panels due to the \"limited\" series.</p><p>He would actually achieve a day in which there would be peace on Earth, as documented by journalist Nathan Freeman, not a single shot would be fired on Earth for 24 hours. Although this Mar-Vell would be revealed to be a Skrull, (though there are other theories), he would still rebel to fight against the invading Skrulls.</p><p>However, as much of a success the Reed/Weeks mini would be, once again this Mar-Vell would be used as a \"legacy\" character in the overall arc, as opposed to bring the original back as advertised. This time adding Kree ensign <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/noh-varr/29-11565/\">Noh-Varr</a> to a list of characters including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/photon/29-11337/\">Monica Rambeau</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/genis-vell/29-4813/\">Genis-Vel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Marvin Ellwood</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-atlas/29-27096/\">Captain Atlas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phyla/29-40922/\">Phyla-Vell</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/photon/29-60871/\">Photon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pulsar-the-spaceknight/29-60507/\">Pulsar</a>, and to some even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a>, as one of the many Captain Marvel successors, all of which, along with many alternate reality and indirectly related characters begin to demonstrate a bit of parody to the real Mar-Vell.</p><p>During the months between the January 2007 release of <em>The Return</em> to the November 8, 2007 release of <em>Captain Marvel #1</em>, to issue # 5, Young Avengers Presents #2 (an issue featuring Captain Mar-Vell and his son Teddy Altman aka Hulkling), Thunderbolts #122, Mighty Avengers #19 and the corresponding issues featuring the character on the cover and content, Captain Marvel (what appeared to be the real Mar-Vell) and the related titles featuring him, would sell an estimated <strong>4, 444, 433*</strong> units in less than a year in the modern era with little or no corporate promotion, although is obviously not for Mar-Vell alone, the success of the mini series does merit attention.</p><p>*<em>Credit: Comic Chronicles - <a href=\"http://www.comicchron.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><i>www.comicchron.com</i></a></em></p><h3>The Retconned Spawned Children</h3><p>After Mar-Vell's physical \"death\", the Titian Elysius, whom was his lover would impregnate herself on two occasions.

The resurrected Captain Marvel is deployed to act as a pawn against the Avengers and in defense of the Phoenix Force. He is shown collaborating with Ms. Marvel and Protector, announcing that they must \"Destroy the Avengers\". Mar-Vell, Ms. Marvel, and the Protector battle the Avengers while under mental influence. The Vision begins to free members of the Kree by countering the mind control, but the Kree are executed. The Vision then freed Mar-Vell, Ms. Marvel and the Protector from control. It turns out that Mar-Vell had a blue-skinned Kree nephew who lived in disgrace due to the Mar-Vell name being disgraced by Mar-Vell siding with Earth against the Kree long ago. This nephew was named Minister Marvel and his son had the power to influence and control minds. Minister Marvel's plan was to have the Phoenix evolve the Kree race and take credit for it thus redeeming the name Mar-Vell. Reviving Captain Mar-Vell was part of his plan as he needed a messianic figure to help rally and influence the Kree. Upon seeing his plan fail, Minister Marvel killed his son then killed himself in front of Mar-Vell. The Avengers then confront the Phoenix Force as it approaches the Kree homeworld. Thor and Ms. Marvel fail to stop it and even though Captain Britain was holding the Phoenix at bay, Mar-Vell sensed the truth of the situation. The Phoenix Force was coming to the Kree world to reclaim the Phoenix energy within Mar-Vell's body that brought him back to life and put his cancer into stasis. He sends Captain Britain away and sacrifices himself to save the Kree race that shunned him by allowing the Phoenix Force to reclaim its energies. The process left Mar-Vell adrift in space and his lifeless body was later seen on the planet with plant life suddenly growing around it. Ms. Marvel reports all this in the Avengers log and decides that the name of Captain Marvel must continue.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Mar-Vell is a warrior. The \"best of the best\" of the soldiers of the Kree Empire whose tyrannical rule spans many planets as recorded in Marvel Comics History. This means that Mar-Vell has the best in hand to hand combat skills and war strategy before the addition of any superpowers, as evidenced in the characters evolution through encounters with \"Zo\", \"Eon\", the \"Nega-Bands\", or any of the character's adventures or natural progression.</p><p>He had the ability to absorb solar energy. By doing this, he was able to greatly increase his strength. It also gave him the ability to fly and to fire blasts of energy from his body. Captain Marvel was \"cosmically aware\", meaning that he was semi-omniscient. He could see an enemy's weakness simply by thinking about it, thus having a superhuman insight coupled with his already proven warrior skill, leadership and intelligence. Mar-Vell had achieved a mental \"nirvana\" of sorts, the complexity of which being that he was both warrior and protector.</p><p>Thanks to the Nega-Bands, Mar-Vell became able to store much more solar energy and focus his photon blast. By hitting the Nega Bands together, Mar-Vell was able to switch places with Rick Jones, who resided in the Negative Zone.</p><p>Mar-Vell was a captain in the Kree Army. In the military, he received advanced training in hand-to-hand combat as well as armed combat with a multitude of weapons. He also had a firm understanding of warfare and was an apt tactician.</p><p>Mar-Vell can fly unaided in space at, or in excess of, light speeds, no longer needing food for sustenance. He appears to be stronger in the day when on Earth as to siphon solar energy.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"199130\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/199130-102206-captain-marvel_super.jpg\" title=\"The Universe's Mightiest Mortal\"><img id=\"199130\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3853/199130-102206-captain-marvel_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Universe's Mightiest Mortal\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Universe's Mightiest Mortal</div></div></div></div><p>Mar-Vell's leadership is often an underrated category in his skillset, but is evidenced in his categorical role of leader when teaming with with Earth's mightiest heroes, namely The Avengers (as evidenced in the first cosmic cube saga involving Thanos, which is chronicled in CM #25-#33 and spotlighted on the cover of CM #31) in any of his incarnations.</p><p>Another misconception is that Mar-Vell needed the nega bands for the power of flight, which is erroneous journalism at best, as he was granted this and other powers (teleportation and illusion casting) by the being called \"Zo\" which ended up being a from for an internal conspiracy in the Kree Supreme Council.</p><p>Captain Marvel is said to have been 6'2\" tall, and around 240 lbs, and would have knowledge of most mechanical and war devices of the Kree Empire. He did have some degree of what could be referred to as superhuman intelligence, however this seems to be overlooked in the known rating systems. He was able to shoulder the burden of cosmic awareness in it's fullest scope without going insane. The scope of Cosmic awareness does touch upon omniscience and as evidenced in his comics, this power grew in magnitude as the comic went on, actually using it to channel life force in CM #61 and to speak with animals, eventually becoming such an asset he could turn it inward for the use of medical scans as well as a communication tool without any movement of body (see Hulk #246). Though Mar-Vell's body was not one with the universe, his spirit was, thus adding to the controversy surrounding his physical death.</p><p>Another aspect of Captain Marvel's powers is that once he was separated from Rick Jones, he can create a portal to the negative zone by simply concentrating and clanging his bands together. (Captain Marvel #57)</p><p>Mar-Vell has been shown being able to dodge lasers at point blank range and anticipate an enemy's method of attack before they do it themselves.</p><p>Mar-Vell 's original power assessment in the early works, was simply to turn the psionic energy into the physical energy, leaving a touch of ambiguity.. So the scope of Mar-Vell's powers have never really been accurately described in printed form, at any of his various power enhancements, especially with Cosmic Awareness.</p><p>It is also of note, that the true gauge, or 'scope' as they say, of Marvel's cosmic awareness has never been truly defined though it did grow and expand as the character progressed. It went from determining a villain's weakness to out of body contact. Ex. Hulk #246 where Mar-Vell communicated with the Hulk at the most fierce point of his rage simply by touching him and again in Captain Marvel #60 where he managed to calm the beasts commanded by the alluring Elyisius and win her heart simultaneously.</p><h2>Alternate realities</h2><h4><b>Ultimate Captain Marvel (Earth-1610)</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1279752\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35011/1279752-ultcapmarv2.jpg\" title=\"Ultimate Captain Marvel\"><img id=\"1279752\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35011/1279752-ultcapmarv2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate Captain Marvel\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultimate Captain Marvel</div></div></div></div><p>Pluskommander Geheneris Halason Mahr Vehl of the Kree Void Navy was part of a unit sent to Earth on a mission of observation. While the rest of his unit remained off-world, he underwent extensive reconstructive surgery to appear as human and went undercover as Dr. Phillip Lawson. Their mission was to observe Earth being destroyed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/galactus/29-2149/\">Gah Lak Tus</a> entity, but Mahr-Vehl came to appreciate humanity. He inserted himself into the human's Asis Project, which was to be a breakthrough in space travel via zero point energy. His plan was to contribute enough to accelerate the project and give human beings the capability to leave Earth when Gah Lak Tus came, sparing at least a fraction of the population.</p><p>Mahr Vehl's commanding officer, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yon-rogg/29-6094/\">Yahn Rgg</a>, had more dire plans for the human race. Knowledge of the true nature of Gah Lak Tus drove him over the edge of sanity, and he wanted to make sure that no human could escape extinction. On the day of Asis' completion, Yahn Rgg deployed a Kree Killform to destroy it. Mahr Vehl armored up and protected the key component of Asis as best he could, destroying the Killform in the process. The resulting explosion left him stunned and captured by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a>.</p><p>When he woke up, he was interrogated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a>, head of security for the Asis Project and a human he had cultivated an amusing antagonistic relationship with. He had no choice but to tell the truth about himself, and when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a> joined the discussion, he mentioned Gah Lak Tus. He knew that Fury already knew that name, because he was aware that S.H.I.E.L.D. had found the herald prior to this. Mahr Vehl told Fury that he was effectively defecting to help the human race.</p><p>After killing Yahn Rgg and acquiring the Kree data on Gah Lak Tus, Mahr Vehl allied with S.H.I.E.L.D., the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimates/65-40504/\">Ultimates</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> to develop a means of defense against the entity. He helped them apprehend one of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfers</a>, the true heralds of Gah Lak Tus, for study and interrogation. It was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> who came up with the key to their defense, though, and his weapon managed to hurt Gah Lak Tus enough to drive the entity away. Meanwhile, Mahr Vehl helped fight off an army of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moondragon/29-7214/\">Moondragon</a> clones seeking to stop their defense.

A rift, which turned out to be none other than Captain Mar-Vell, a Kree hero who was dying of Cancer or \"The Black Death\" as it was known on their world. As Mar-Vell slipped further and further into Death's hands and the empathic distress of all who loved and worshiped him grew, something dark, twisted and foul called out to Mar-Vell from the abyss. It appealed to Mar-Vell's desire to live and showed him a simple truth, \"Even Death May Die\". Too weak to realize that he was being fooled, Mar-Vell listened to the entities words as if they were gospel from above and learned of a ritual called The Necropsy. Mar-Vell was transfigured by these words and by those who spoke to him from the never-there and, on his deathbed, asked those who had come to see him one last time to join hands with him.</p><p>The Many-Angled Ones had their victory, by touching Mar-Vell's hands, all of his allies were transfigured into that which should never be just as Mar-Vell himself had been in secret. With their combined might they captured Thanos and performed The Necropsy, thus destroying Death and allowing The Many-Angled Ones to pour into The Cancerverse uncontested.</p><p>He was first seen being greeted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magus/29-14619/\">Adam Magus</a> and Vaughn, The Cancerverse equivalent of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>, on <i>The Eternal Sin</i>, the flagship of The Universal Church of Truth's military forces. When Mar-Vell learned that Adam had failed to perform The Necropsy on Earth-616 he murdered Adam for failing to do as he was told. Upon doing so though, Mar-Vell expressed concern over being in a Universe where things could still die, and would require some time to get used to it.</p><p>Putting aside his own personal feelings, Lord Mar-Vell then ordered Vaughn go back home and assemble their elite fighting force, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/revengers/65-57152/\">The Revengers</a>, in preparation for their inevitable confrontation with Thanos and many other factions who seek to stop The Many-Angled Ones from conquering Earth-616. Lord Mar-Vell was later seen stopping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/major-victory/29-2166/\">Major Victory</a> from escaping, after Iron Man and Ms. Marvel had failed to keep him in their grasp.</p><p>After learning that the Major was an anomaly, Lord Mar-Vell took a closer look but discovered that, like his other prisoners (including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namorita/29-2113/\">Namorita Prentiss</a>), Major Victory was nothing more than a temporal anomaly and had him thrown in the same cell where the other temporal anomalies were being kept.</p><p>It was also learned that Lord Mar-Vell and his Revengers had abandoned The Eternal Sin for another ship, namely Thanos' old starcruiser: <em>The Sanctuary,</em> which was where The Necropsy had been performed in The Cancerverse. Lord Mar-Vell was again seen speaking with Vaughn, who had brought Mar-Vell details of what had happened to his Earth-616 counterpart. The Scarlet Witch arrived with news of The Defenders of The Realms destruction and, at the behest of Ms. Marvel, sent The Revengers back to The Cancerverse to investigate the incident.</p><p>Lord Mar-Vell's Revengers were betrayed by Scarlet Witch, who had been part of the resistance the whole time. Angry at them for hurting her love Vision, she unleashed a powerful blast that knocked all of the Revengers out for the time being. It was later revealed that Lord Mar-Vell brutally killed Wanda after her betrayal. Lord Mar-vell then led the Revengers to intercept Thanos and Star-lord. Thanos and Mar-vell went head on, Thanos then took the upper hand in the fight but than releases him. Thanos states that if Mar-vell gives him Death and the release of Oblivion he will give him everything he wants. Thanos then bows to Mar-vell calling him \"My undying lord\".</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><h4><b>The Super-hero Squad Show (2009-2011)</b></h4><p>Captain Marvel appears in the episode \"Another Order of Evil\" Pt. 1.

He is portrayed as being closer to his \"Ultimate\" counterpart; a blue-skinned Kree rather than his traditional pink Kree appearance, with advanced shape-shifting Kree weaponry at his disposal rather than his conventional Nega-Bands. He was apparently sent to Earth as an advanced reconnaissance scout to determine if humans had the \"potential\" to exist separately from the Kree Empire. While on Earth, he uses the alias \"Philip Lawson,\" until his cover is blown and he states his true designation as \"Geheneris Halason Mahr Vehl, Pluskommander in the Kree Void Science Navy,\" a rank he states is analogous of a Captain in Earth terminology. He is stationed at a SHIELD observatory along with Carol Danvers when he hears word of a Kree Sentry crash landing in the middle of the nearby forest. From this point on, he helps the Avengers save Earth from a Kree Sentry as it is sent to purge the planet of all human life so the Kree can use it as a base and for resources in their war against the Skrulls. He is initially distrusted by the team, particularly Wasp, due to him being an alien, but after pleading with his commander Yahn Rgg, and nearly sacrificing himself by carrying the Sentry's fail-safe Nega-Bomb into space, Mar-Vell earns the respect of the Avengers. In the end he leaves to plead with the Kree Supreme Intelligence to spare Earth, and states that ultimately the Kree will try to take Earth again. Just after he leaves, however, Carol Danvers begins to float off of her hospital bed, realizes that she has been given super-powers after being exposed to Mar-Vell's Kree technology.</p>", "deck": "Mar-Vell rebelled against a racist tyrannical empire to defend Earth and in so doing became the \"Protector of the Universe\" known as Captain Marvel.

She was adopted by the Danes. Little is known about them other then they are an affluent couple. She was born with green hair, due to her mutant gene, but kept it dyed so she wouldn't seem different from others and be ostracized.</p><p>It seemed that there was a genetic defect in Lorna that prevented her latent mutant abilities from manifesting. When a villain named <a href=\"../../mesmero/29-5065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mesmero</a> used his so called psyche-generator, which allowed him to command all mutants in North America with latent powers. Lorna was one of these latent mutants and she was forced to travel to San Francisco to unite with <a href=\"../../mesmero/29-5065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mesmero</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Meeting Mesmero</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"156304\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/156304-161451-polaris_super.jpg\" title=\"Lorna and Bobby\"><img id=\"156304\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/156304-161451-polaris_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lorna and Bobby\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lorna and Bobby</div></div></div></div><p>Lorna meets <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Bobby Drake</a> while out in San Francisco when he ices the ground under her, making her trip over it. Bobby was able to convince Lorna to come with him to his apartment. When Lorna finally meets the X-Men, they all discover that she is actually a mutant with latent powers. Mesmero would come and kidnap her, bringing her to his headquarters. He put her in a \u201cgenetic stimulator\u201d that activated her latent mutant abilities. The X-Men would try and save her and Magneto was revealed to be the the mastermind behind the whole thing. He also reveals that he is the father of Lorna. This caused Lorna to hesitate when an opportunity to kill him presented itself. However, Iceman would be able to convince Lorna that Magneto is not really her father when he brings up evidence that her parents died in a plane crash. Lorna then defeated Magneto, who would later be revealed as an android. Lorna would join the X-Men and would pick up the code name Magnetrix, however she did not like it and decided to get rid of it.</p><h3>Captured by the Sentinels</h3><p>Lorna was captured by Sentinels when she moved to Manhattan, and she was so shocked that she didn't have a chance to use her powers. In the Sentinel's base, she met <a href=\"/havok/29-3546/\">Havok</a>, the younger brother of Cyclops, and the two got along pretty well. Unfortunately, <a href=\"/larry-trask/29-10255/\">Larry Trask</a>, who was controlling the Sentinels, used this to his advantage and threatened Lorna to get Havok to do what he wanted. After the X-Men saved Havok and Lorna, she decided to join the X-Men since she was sick of being a victim and sitting on the sidelines. Also, she was growing attracted to Havok. This strongly annoyed Iceman, since he had introduced Lorna to the X-Men and felt he had the rights to pursue a relationship with Lorna first. Since Alex and Lorna didn't have full control over their powers yet, they were often given easier missions or left out completely.</p><h3>Becoming Polaris</h3><p>When the senior X-Men had trouble in the <a href=\"/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>, Professor X sent Havok and Lorna to help them. During their introduction to Ka-Zar, Lorna realized that she didn't have a codename, and came up with \"Magnetrix\". However, she didn't really like it so stopped using it after a very short while. After the adventure in the Savage Land, the X-Men encountered a group who called themselves the Promise, who waited for the final confrontation between humans and mutants and only stepped out of their cryogenic chambers once every 10 years. During one point when they stepped out, they took control of Lorna and Havok, since they hadn't been X-Men for as long of the rest of the team. Under the control of the Promise, Lorna first used her abilities to fly. Luckily, Havok and Lorna were freed by a member of the Promise who didn't agree with the leader, and prevented the leader from putting Havok and Lorna in a cryogenic chamber.</p><p>A bit later, Havok quit the X-Men after a fight with Iceman over Lorna, and didn't return. Professor X sent Lorna to go find him, and ask him to come back. Whilst in the south-western deserts, Lorna was mistaken by the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> for his former lover, Jarella, due to her green hair. The Hulk grew confused and angry, and was ready to attack Lorna when Havok appeared and managed to use his powers at a skill level he hadn't had before. Havok realized that he had a good chance at being a hero, so decided to rejoin the X-Men. On the way back home, Lorna and Havok were captured by the Secret Empire. The X-Men did not go to find out why Lorna and Havok hadn't returned, assuming that they wanted to be alone together and not rejoin the X-Men. After some time, they realized that there must be something wrong and managed to find and save Lorna and Havok with help from Captain America.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76651\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76651-115691-polaris_super.jpg\" title=\"Polaris\"><img id=\"76651\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76651-115691-polaris_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Polaris\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Polaris</div></div></div></div><p>The first time Lorna was able to display parts of her fullest potential, it was when the X-Men were kidnapped on Krakoa and a new team was sent to rescue them. She was able to disrupt the Earth\u2019s magnetic forces and throw Krakoa into space. Iceman would eventually develop a crush on Lorna, however Lorna did not have the same feelings for Iceman. She ended up falling in love with Alex Summers (Havok). The two of them decided to leave the X-Men because they did not like risking their lives. They decided to pursue their love for geophysics and moved to the Diablo mountain range in California.</p><p>Lorna would soon be under the mind control of a Shi'ar agent named <a href=\"/eric-the-red/29-13360/\">Davan Shakari</a> who worked for D\u2019Ken when he was emperor of the Shi\u2019ar Galaxy. Shakari is the one who dubbed Lorna \u201cPolaris\u201d and first gave her her purple costume which was a big departure from her original flowing green one (which she now wears a variation of again). Shakari would next kidnap Alex and put him under mind control also. They used them to turn on the X-Men and try to assassinate Professor X. The two of them would battle the X-Men at Kennedy International Airport. Lorna would soon be defeated by Storm and Professor Xavier was be able to free them from Shakari\u2019s control.</p><h3>A \"Normal\" Life</h3><p>Lorna and Alex would remain as civilians for a long time, but they would also assisting the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> on occasion. Lorna and Alex lived happily as civilians in the New Mexico desert and also were able to complete their degrees. Later, while Havok was rejoining the X-Men (unknown to Lorna) the <a href=\"../../marauders/65-40480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marauders</a> hunted Lorna at her desert home and during the heat of the battle Lorna became possessed by the psionic being, <a href=\"/malice/29-11877/\">Malice.</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76652\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76652-184556-polaris_super.jpg\" title=\"Possessed by Malice\"><img id=\"76652\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76652-184556-polaris_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Possessed by Malice\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Possessed by Malice</div></div></div></div><p>Malice\u2019s powers were able to blend with Lorna\u2019s perfectly and together they became a powerful (albeit inseparable) being.

She grew in height, became invulnerable, and gained super strength. They defeated <a href=\"../../zaladane/29-21948/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaladane</a> and Lorna would shrink back to normal and was finally free. She went to <a href=\"../../muir-island/34-43505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Muir Island</a> in seek of <a href=\"../../moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moira MacTaggert</a> to help explain her mutation. On her way there her 2nd mutant powers activated again and she grew big. She also discovered that he mutant powers amplify negative emotions to others around her. <a href=\"../../moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moira MacTaggert</a> would examine her but was clueless.</p><h3>Muir Island and the Shadow King</h3><p>Lorna remained on Muir Island after this, working with Moira's \"Muir Island X-Men\". Later it would be revealed that Lorna gained her strength and size from absorbing the negative emotions of those around her. The <a href=\"../../shadow-king/29-14889/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow King</a> would discover this and set Lorna up as his nexus between the astral plane and real world. This caused the whole world to grow angry and violent. Eventually during the Muir Island Saga the <a href=\"../../x-factor/65-24131/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Factor</a> and X-Men would save her from Shadow King\u2019s control using a stab to the head from Psylocke's psychic knife. Right around this time, Zaladane was killed by Magneto in the Savage Land, returning all of Lorna\u2019s powers.</p><h3>X-Factor</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76712\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76712-185134-x-factor_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Factor\"><img id=\"76712\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/170/76712-185134-x-factor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Factor\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Factor</div></div></div></div><p>Lorna received an offer to join the government team, <a href=\"../../x-factor/65-24131/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Factor</a>, by <a href=\"../../valerie-cooper/29-14860/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valerie Cooper</a>. With this she was able to reunite with Alex. The two of them would become co - leaders of <a href=\"../../x-factor/65-24131/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Factor</a>. Their relationship however would be shaky the whole time because Lorna began to grow stronger and more confident. They would break up and get back together several times.</p><p>With Lorna becoming so strong, she became the Government\u2019s \u201csecret weapon\u201d against a possible attack from <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a>. <a href=\"../../malice/29-11877/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malice</a> would return to try and possess Lorna again but this time Alex would be there and try to absorb half of Malice with Lorna.</p><p>This causes <a href=\"../../malice/29-11877/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malice</a> to not be able to control someone, eventually <a href=\"../../malice/29-11877/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Malice</a> was killed by <a href=\"../../mr-sinister/29-3179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Sinister</a>.

However, this would turn out to be a fatal mistake when <a href=\"../../sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabretooth</a> almost killed the entire team himself. Later she would witness Alex (apparently) getting killed in an explosion.</p><h3>Genosha</h3><p>Later Lorna would meet <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> at a church and told him that she felt someone was following her and that Alex was alive somewhere. It would be revealed that some <a href=\"../../skrull/12-43139/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrull</a> working for <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> was following her in order to steal Alex\u2019s costume. Lorna would join the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> to battle <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> in Egypt. Lorna would meet <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a> and he discovers that he could use her to disrupt the magnetic forces of Earth. During the battle against <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a>, Lorna was able to assist Magneto and hide the fact that his powers had been reduced. The two then went to the island nation of <a href=\"../../genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha</a>.</p><p><a href=\"../../genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha</a> was a nation that enslaved mutants, and Magneto took it upon himself to overthrow the government with Lorna's help. She agreed because she liked the training <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a> gave her in return for her help. She began to gain more knowledge in accessing her full potential. When <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magneto</a> decided to use Lorna's powers to wipe out the last city that was not under his control she decided to try to stop him from using technology to restore his damaged x-gene, but was defeated by him. Lorna left only to return later to help the Genoshan people. The island of Genosha was then attacked by the mutant hunting robots known as <a href=\"../../sentinels/65-4296/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentinels</a>. Lorna was one of the few survivors but left scarred because was not able to stop the robot and sat there witnessing the murder of millions of mutants. When Magneto recorded the thoughts of the entire population's final moments as digital signals in a black box, Lorna became \"possessed\" by the \"ghosts\" of <a href=\"../../genosha/34-40967/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genosha</a>. She then constructed a monument in honor of Magneto. The <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> would go to Genosha to aid anyone that survived, upon their arrival they discover Lorna walking around naked and weak.</p><h3>X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"877359\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29567/877359-new_15_super.jpg\" title=\"Back with the X-Men\"><img id=\"877359\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29567/877359-new_15_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Back with the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Back with the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>After Alex was found in a coma, Lorna returned to the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a>. Her attitude had changed, becoming more dark and violent. This all had to do with the traumatic events she witnessed in Genosha, being one of the only survivors after the Sentinel attack by Cassandra Nova. Even her impending marriage to Alex failed to change her behavior. She uncharacteristically killed some mutant-killing soldiers. This resulted in Alex breaking up with Lorna right before their wedding for the X-Men\u2019s personal nurse <a href=\"../../annie-ghazikhanian/29-4564/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Annie Ghazikhanian</a>. Traumatized and humiliated, the unstable Polaris went berserk and commenced to go on a rampage that nearly resulted in her killing Alex. <a href=\"../../juggernaut/29-1445/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Juggernaut</a> stopped Lorna by knocking her out. <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Xavier</a> helped Lorna through psychic therapy.</p><p>Through the course of the Professor's therapy, it was revealed that Lorna had learned that she was the biological daughter of Magneto during her time in Genosha. Her uncharacteristic behavior was also discovered to be a reaction to witnessing the genocide on Genosha. After the session, Lorna promised to stop her violent rampage and return to the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men.</a> Iceman later admitted to Polaris that he still had feelings for her and after some mild flirtation, the two began a relationship. The relationship was not to last, however, since Lorna's other relationships (namely with Havok) were still unresolved. Havok has confessed to still loving her after Annie had left him, however, Polaris pushed him away.</p><h3>M-Day</h3><p>After the events of \"M-Day,\" in which the majority of mutants lost their powers, Lorna also lost her mutant gene and her magnetic powers. Lorna attempted to hide her loss from her fellow teammates fearing she would be kicked off the team. She was confronted by Valerie Cooper who knew Lorna had lost her powers, but Lorna would claim that it was a psychological problem that was preventing her from accessing them. When she was nearly killed because she could not access her powers, Lorna finally admitted that she lost them. She ended up leaving with Alex watching over her. During her journey, Lorna was kidnapped by an alien named Doop who crashed on Earth, who was also a creature that Lorna saw in space on an earlier mission.</p><p>Lorna soon was kidnapped by <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> and transformed into one of his <a href=\"../../horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horsemen of Apocalypse</a> known as Pestilence. Lorna had the ability to ingest and create new plagues. <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> also used his advanced technology to give Lorna back a magnetic power similar to the powers she lost on <a href=\"../../m-day/12-41003/\" rel=\"nofollow\">M-Day</a>. While under his influence and brainwashed, Lorna infiltrated the World Health Organization and took the viruses there to create a meta-plague. <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> had planned to infect all of humanity so that he could offer a cure to only 10% of the population.</p><p>They would battle the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> and <a href=\"../../new-avengers/65-42520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Avengers</a> when they finally discover Pestilence was actually Lorna. Lorna would be able to resist Apocalypse and would later recover in the <a href=\"../../xavier-institute-for-higher-learning/34-41138/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Xavier Institute for Higher Learning</a>. <a href=\"../../gambit/29-1499/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gambit</a> and <a href=\"../../sunfire/29-3175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunfire</a> would return to the X-Mansion and try to recover Lorna, but they battled the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> and failed. Lorna would leave the mansion that night to search for <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> in Egypt and would eventually be rescued by <a href=\"../../havok/29-3546/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Havok</a> and the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a>. It is unknown why <a href=\"../../apocalypse/29-7612/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apocalypse</a> gave Lorna back her magnetic abilities, as they weren't a part of his plans before being thwarted by the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a>.</p><h3>Starjammers</h3><p>Recently the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> learned that the \"all-new all-different X-Men\" that were recruited and sent to Krakoa were not Xavier's first rescue attempt. Only one of the members of the original rescue team, <a href=\"../../vulcan/29-21233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vulcan</a>, had survived. Lorna has rejoined the <a href=\"../../x-men/65-3173/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Men</a> and accompanying <a href=\"../../professor-x/29-1505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Professor Xavier</a> and his team of Uncanny X-Men to find and stop Vulcan after Vulcan set off into space for Shi'ar space with the intention of single-handedly bringing down the Shi'ar empire. On rout to the center of the Shi'ar empire Lorna and Havok have been rekindling some of their relationship. Lorna has also been working on learning how to control her new magnetic powers that mimic her old powers using technology.</p><p>Polaris seems to have gotten in touch with her powers and she began to wield them like her old ones she could control the energies of the others on board their ship when Vulcan crushed the star gates to prevent them form fallowing him.</p><p>During a huge fight with <a href=\"../../vulcan/29-21233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vulcan</a> and the royal guard she managed to display her former power level by stopping even the almost unstoppable <a href=\"../../gladiator/29-4653/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gladiator</a> for a moment.</p><p>When Vulcan began to beat Havok it was Polaris who stopped him by attacking his bloodstream she fought him to the point where he was near death and spitting out blood plus his powers weakened. She would have killed him if Deathbird hadn't attack her letting Havok fight Vulcan again on a fair level and he too almost killed Vulcan and left him even weaker.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"239251\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/239251-194230-polaris_super.jpg\" title=\"Polaris\"><img id=\"239251\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/239251-194230-polaris_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Polaris\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Polaris</div></div></div></div><p>This however didn't stop Vulcan from killing his father Corsair with a powerful blast of energy and the fight began to rage out of control so Lilandra sent half the team home against their will and Vulcan left with Deathbird to heal form his wounds. Polaris along with Marvel Girl, Havok, and Korvus stayed with the remaining Starjammers to fight Vulcan and restore Lilandra to the throne. During this time, Lorna acted both as Alex's lover and second-in-command of the team. While their early efforts at destabilizing Vulcan's rule were highly successful, partially due to the hatred of his own subjects towards him, the rebellion was forced to ally with the tyrant when a merciless alien force calling themselves the \"Scy'ar Tal\" assaulted the Shi'ar world of Feather's Edge. Claiming vengeance for a Shi'ar attack that had killed many of their people centuries ago, the Scy'ar Tal destroyed the planet using a massive super weapon called Finality, before declaring their intention to recapture their former home planet, the World, home of the M'Kraan Crystal. While the two sides allied with each other and successfully defeated the menace, Polaris and the rest of the Starjammers were eventually betrayed and captured by Vulcan's forces. As the insane mutant solidifies his grip on power, Polaris and the Starjammers are now his prisoners, cut off from the X-Men and any hope of rescue.</p><p>Polaris is held under constant sedation while imprisoned, due to the Shi'ar's inability to deal with her powers. With the help of Lilandra, Lorna and the other prisoners are eventually freed. She and the Starjammers escape to Kree-space, where Lorna discovers that her sister-in-law and good friend, Crystal, is being wed to Ronan the Accuser, a move meant to solidify ties between the Inhumans and the Kree. When the wedding is disrupted by the invading Shi'ar, and Lilandra captured, Lorna participates in a rescue attempt which concludes with them freeing Lilandra and bringing the powerful Gladiator to their side.</p><p>As the war between Kree and Shi'ar escalates, Polaris and the Starjammers participate in an attempted political coup by Lilandra on the throne world of Chandrilar. She is a horrified witness when Lilandra is killed in the ensuing chaos.</p><p>While in battle during the War of Kings, Korvus and Rachel Summers lose their connection with the Phoenix Force along with all others host of it. Briefly after this the Starjammers head back for Earth after Rogue, Gambit and Magneto come to their aid.</p><h3><b>Regenesis</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2124338\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51192/2124338-x_factor_233_by_davidyardin_d4j0xo4.jpg\" title=\"By David Yardin\"><img id=\"2124338\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51192/2124338-x_factor_233_by_davidyardin_d4j0xo4_medium.jpg\" alt=\"By David Yardin\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">By David Yardin</div></div></div></div><p>Following the X-Men's <a href=\"/schism/39-56404/\">Schism</a> and <a href=\"/regenesis/39-56644/\">Regenesis</a>, Rachel, Alex and Lorna side with Wolverine. Wolverine then takes Lorna and Alex to rejoin their former team <a href=\"/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Polaris once possessed the natural ability to manipulate magnetism. Although she had the potential to exercise all of the powers that Magento has, as yet she had only used powers involving the manipulation of magnetic, electrical, and gravitational fields. Moreover, she could not summon as great an amount of energy as Magneto could. The exact limits on the amount weight that she can magnetically lift at present have not been measured, but they are considerably below those of Magneto. Since she has preferred not to use her powers in combat situations, she has not worked nearly as hard to develop them as Magneto has. As with Magneto, it is unknown whether Polaris's powers were purely psionic or whether they derive from her physically.</p><p>Polaris had been observed levitating metallic objects and creating force fields in which she can suspend persons or objects in the air and in which she can protect them from attacks from outside the fields. She could also overload or short-circuit electrical systems. By concentrating, Polaris could perceive the world around herself solely as patterns of magnetic and electrical energy. She could perceive the natural magnetic auras surrounding living beings, as well.</p><p>At one time, when her magnetic powers were just temporarily inaccessible, Lorna possessed the ability to sense and feed off of negative emotions. She could then transduce those emotions into raw physical powers of strength, durability, and stamina.</p><p>She was de-powered by <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">her half-siste</a>r after M-Day, but almost immediately thereafter she was re-powered by Apocalypse when she was made into a horseman. As his horseman, Lorna could assimilate and release all forms of disease and sickness. She was then cured of the plagues which she ingested as Pestilence, and in that respect seems to be back to normal. It was then revealed that Apocalypse repowered her using Celestial tech and she again can manipulate electromagnetism. Polaris was confirmed to have her X-Gene restored in X-Men Legacy #259.</p><p>Polaris has stated that these new powers are more difficult to control compared to when she was a mutant and far more dangerous. It has also been said by Emma Frost, that her powers are apparently mutating.</p><p>Polaris also has green hair due to her x-gene. She still has green hair now because like many other mutants she keep her physical mutation after m-day.</p><h3>Power Controversy</h3><p><i><b>Reader Submitted Question:</b> In War of Kings #2 it is stated that Polaris is a mutant again, but before that it was unclear how the Celestial technology was repowering her. I was wondering what depowered mutants who have been repowered various ways are currently mutants again?</i></p><p><b>Marvel editor Tom Brevoort:</b> <i>I don't think this is a simply binary question--it'll be different in every case. It's still not been made clear precisely what the Celestial tech did to Polaris, and whether that amounts to reactivating her X-gene and returning her powers to her, or finding other ways of giving her similar abilities. And I'd think this would be different for any other character who might have gotten their powers restored through some other means (such as the return of Quicksilver's speed.)</i></p><p><i>In short, I don't have a clear answer for you on this one.</i></p><p>http://marvel.com/blogs/Tom_Brevoort/entry/1487</p><p>Clarification: Polaris was confirmed to have her X-Gene restored in X-Men Legacy #259.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li><b>Gender:</b> Female</li></ul><ul><li><b>Height:</b> 5' 7\"</li></ul><ul><li><b>Weight:</b> 115 lbs</li></ul><ul><li><b>Eyes:</b> Green</li></ul><ul><li><b>Hair:</b> Green</li></ul><h2>Status</h2><ul><li><b>Known Relatives:</b> <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnus</a> (Magneto, Father); unnamed mother (deceased); <a href=\"../../anya/29-45373/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anya</a> (half-sister, deceased); <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanda Maximoff</a> (Scarlet Witch, half-sister); <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pietro Maximoff</a> (Quicksilver, half-brother); <a href=\"../../crystal/29-2115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal</a> (sister-in-law); <a href=\"../../luna/29-10962/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luna Maximoff</a> (niece); Mr. Dane (adoptive father); Mrs. Dane (adoptive mother); <a href=\"../../zaladane/29-21948/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zaladane</a> (self-acclaimed sister, deceased)</li></ul><ul><li><b>Citizenshp:</b> American (presumed)</li></ul><ul><li><b>Place of Birth:</b> Unrevealed</li></ul><ul><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Single</li></ul><ul><li><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer; formerly U.S. government operative, Terrorist, geophysics graduate student</li></ul><ul><li><b>Education:</b> Masters degree in geophysics, some doctoral research completed</li></ul><h2>Other Versions</h2><p><u><b>Earth-295: Age of Apocalypse</b></u></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"239323\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/239323-180903-polaris_super.jpg\" title=\"Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse\"><img id=\"239323\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/239323-180903-polaris_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>In the Age of Apocalypse reality she was only a frightening adolescent without powers when Apocalypse attacked humanity the first time, in this genocide her parents died, this tragedy led her to lose some of her sanity believing her herself to be Magneto\u00b4s Daughter.

Polaris was among the students who had passed a field test, allowing her to assist local authorities from time to time. During such a mission, Lorna's powers seemingly spiral out of control, killing dozens of humans before Havok is forced to subdue her. After being placed in the same prison that held Magneto, it is revealed that he had her set up, when one of the Brotherhood members placed a magnetic device near her location. Magneto uses her imprisonment to his advantage, knowing that Havok and the other students will come to her aid. During the chaos that ensues, Magneto switches places with Mystique, and Lorna's name is cleared. During the Ultimatum story line, Magneto sends his brotherhood to destroy the Academy of Tomorrow and kill all of the students within, including Polaris.</p><h3><u>Earth-9997</u></h3><p>In the Earth X reality Polaris and Havok were members of the Starjammers.</p><h3><u>Earth-58163</u></h3><p>In the <a href=\"../../house-of-m/39-40991/\" rel=\"nofollow\">House of M</a> reality Lorna was a member of Magneto's royal family and had a close relationship with her father.</p><h3><u>Earth-3931</u></h3><p>In this reality Polaris was a vampire, and a member of the Avengers who all were vampires.</p><h3><u>Earth-8149</u></h3><p>This Polaris was plucked from her reality moments before being killed by Sentinels resistant to her powers. She is now a member of the latest team of Exiles. In her original reality, many other mutants were dead, and fighting regularly by herself against greater odds has made her more experienced with combat and skilled with her powers than many other versions of her. This is seen very early in her first mission as an Exile, where she easily handles her counterpart due to the latter being a pampered Genoshan princess.</p><p>She demonstrates her skill and power in fighting sentinels on the Exiles' second mission, defeating 4 sentinels by herself with barely any effort. However, she is captured by Ultron, Machine Man, and Vision by drugging her with a sedative while she was asleep. At present, she is a captive of the machines of that reality, and was witnessed by Blink to be in a seemingly dismembered and dissected state.</p><p>Blink retaliates against Ultron, Machine Man, and Vision for doing what she sees as the brutal death of her teammate. In the ensuing battle, she destroys Cerebro's remote unit in the lab. Lorna reveals that she is alive, and what Blink saw was only a Life Model Decoy made to look like her. The others are also shown to be alive and well. The three robots, particularly Ultron (who is shown to harbor the mind of Hank Pym), reveal that they have been spending time preserving the consciousness of humanity in Cerebro's robotic constructs while pretending to be on Cerebro's side.</p><p>While Blink takes Forge and Beast to destroy Cerebro's primary memory core, Polaris, Panther, Witch, Ultron, Machine Man and Vision distract Cerebro's primary robot forces.

When Iceman decided to apologize, he found out that Polaris is not already in their house. He thought that she was abducted by the X-Factor. As Iceman asks assistance from Jubilee, the X-men followed and fought the X-Factor. However, as the tension calms down as both parties confront each other, Polaris stated that she was not kidnapped. She became a member of the X-Factor and apologizes to Iceman because she fell in love with Havok who happened to be her team mate. She also revealed that her feeling for Iceman was gone.</p><h3><u>Wolverine and the X-Men</u></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759449\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23743/759449-watxm_polaris.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine and The X-Men\"><img id=\"759449\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23743/759449-watxm_polaris_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine and The X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine and The X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Polaris is a part of Magneto's family known as House of Magnus. In the present, she is a lonely girl of about seventeen, isolated from most people. She wishes to see the world and live her life, but fears her father will do something rash if she chooses otherwise. She's daddy's little girl in this one, and worked at his every whim. However, Gambit later arrives and woos her into believing many things, one which included her being trapped in Genosha forever, for it was her cage, and a cage is still a cage, even if it do look like a palace. Polaris harbored some feelings for Gambit, and even attempted to run away with him. However, Gambit in the end betrayed her, and taught her the lesson which would eventually play a part in the coming episodes; the world was exactly like Gambit, distrustful, horrid, yet beautiful. After Gambit's failure in stealing Magneto's helmet, and departure, Lorna still harbors some lingering feelings for him. At the end of the season, Lorna leaves her father's side, and joins her sister, Wanda. Together, they banish their father and their brother off the island of Genosha, and clearly state that the old and dutiful Lorna was gone, and the new one would rise.</p><p>Meanwhile, her version from the future is also a member of The House of Magnus, but she is the last member standing. When Genosha was destroyed by the Phoenix, Magneto arrived at a tough decision, and sacrifice his life for his daughter. Before he perished, he gave her his helmet and cape to Lorna as a symbol of a legacy passed on. Genosha was eventually destroyed, but Polaris became mentally unstable. When Professor X's future X-Men showed up, she fought them using her powers, which were as powerful as her father's by now, enough to scare Sentinels away, and be named badlands for the sake of it. She treated Professor X as his father's enemy, and blamed them all for his death. Though Professor X repeatedly stated that he is Magneto's friend and was not his enemy, Polaris still attacks, but then gives up when the Proff. calms her mind down, and gives her back her helmet and cape. He states clearly that Lorna was never the soldier, Magneto knew that, even Prof. knew that, so the poor girl was left to be in her ruined home while they left. However, in the season finale, Polaris returns with Marrow as what she'd finally trained herself to be what her father thought she'd never become, a soldier. She helped Prof. X and the others help destroy Master Mold.</p>", "deck": "The mutant mistress of magnetism, Polaris is the daughter of Magneto and half sister to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch.

He was a chemist working for the <a href=\"/maggia/65-26082/\">Maggia</a>, attempting to develop an addictive drug the crime family could sell.

The normally reclusive Cloak thus became part of a greater team assigned to keep the peace in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a> after a series of pro and anti-mutant riots. Donning a new costume, and now keeping his face un-hooded, Cloak realized that he and Dagger could no longer hold themselves apart from the world at large. When Dagger expressed the idea of running again, Cloak stopped her, saying that if they ran away again they would be on the run forever.</p><p>They kept true to their heroic ideals even when mixed with the more distasteful members of their team. Thus, when Emma and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> betrayed Osborn as part of Scott Summers' ploy, both Cloak and Dagger were invited to join the true X-Men in their exodus from San Francisco.</p><p>Tandy and Ty accepted, and the two runaways became part of a different team, and among their own kind.</p><p>After tests were taken, it was relieved that neither Tandy nor Ty were mutants, and that the drug gave both superheros their powers.</p><h3>Fear Itself: The Deep</h3><p><a href=\"../../attuma/29-15779/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attuma</a> has become one of the <a href=\"../../the-worthy/65-58278/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Worthy</a> and is transformed into Nerkkod, Breaker of Oceans after he comes into possession of one of the mystic hammers. Nerkkod would bolster his army and prepare to conquer the oceans but is confronted by Namor and company. Dr. Strange would conjure up a spell and call upon the Defenders from the past and present including Cloak for reinforcements. Nerkkod is forced to retreat and his army is defeated.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Cloak's powers derive from his ability to manipulate <a href=\"/darkforce/12-41411/\">Darkforce</a> energy and access the dimension from which it originates. He might actually be made of this negative energy. Darkforce energy is perceived by humans as dark matter, either in gas, liquid, or solid form. It is cold, draining, and prolonged exposure can cause insanity, turn one evil, and even kill. Cloak can do the following:</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Create a localized field of impenetrable darkness.</li><li>Create mobile, solid tendrils of darkness.</li><li>Hide in shadows.</li><li>Become intangible, perhaps by changing the solid state of his body into a gas state, perhaps by only partially moving into the Darkforce dimension.</li><li>Pull people into the Darkforce dimension by opening a portal within his 'cloak.'</li><li>Teleport himself and others by opening a portal into, then out of, the Darkforce dimension, i.e. taking an inter-dimensional shortcut.</li></ul><h2>Weakness:</h2><p>If Cloak is exposed to too much pure light energy, he will revert back into his human form.

Trickshot taught Clint archery while Swordsman taught Clint acrobatics and knife throwing. The duo became heroes to Clint as he began to surpass his masters. Though Swordsman and Trickshot weren't the greatest father figures, they were the best the circus had to offer, or so he thought. While doing an odd job for a performer, Clint overheard that a great sum of money had been stolen from the ringmaster the night before. Clint thought little of this until he saw Swordsman with an inordinately large sum of money and wondered if his hero could have been the thief the night before. He questioned his mentor and got the answer he was dreading; Swordsman had indeed stolen the money. Swordsman was quick to offer Clint a cut of the ill gotten cash if he could keep his mouth shut, but he refused and was soon chased, beaten and left for dead by the Swordsman. Unable to handle the pain he felt, Clint bolted again. Clint was soon contacted by Barney. Disappointed that Clint left the circus and angry that he was alone, Barney lashed out at his brother. Feeling guilty for leaving his brother, Clint reluctantly agreed to return to his old life. Clint felt unappreciated and alone at the circus. His act, \"The Amazing Hawkeye\" got little attendance. Much to his dismay, his performance was ignored when Iron Man stopped a run away ride. After seeing <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man</a> in action, Clint was inspired to use his archery skills to fight crime.</p><p>The costumed hero Hawkeye's first outing was a major failure; after taking down two jewel thieves, the police arriving on the scene thought him to be the thief. Clint eluded capture, feeling defeated, misunderstood and hurt. He soon ran into the <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a>, a soviet super-spy, and the two became inseparable. Clint didn't know what he was involved in, but the Widow had convinced him that he needed to defeat Iron Man in order to show his true power to the world. He soon wised up to the Black Widow's game and decided he wasn't going to be her distraction for Iron Man any longer, and the he would try his hand at the hero game once more.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Butler and the Avengers</h3><p>Clint begins fighting crime in slum-like conditions.

Jarvis convinces Clint to allow him to buy his hero a meal, and after they get to know each other, tells Clint that he would make a fine addition to Earths Mightiest Heroes, the Avengers. Jarvis and Clint set-up a show for the original <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a>. Clint ties Jarvis up and the Avengers arrive. Clint then shows his skill by shooting the ropes off of Jarvis. After a discussion, the team accepts Clint as a new member. Just like he and Jarvis planned.</p><h3>Shield Slinging Leader</h3><p>Feeling good about being a Avenger, but he is constantly bickering with the other members. Who are <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver,</a> and the lovely <a href=\"../../scarlet-witch/29-1466/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scarlet Witch</a>. Clint who thinks he would be a better leader than the old warhorse Captain America, continuously challenge Cap's orders. Eventually Clint would gain respect for Cap and the two would become close friends through the years. After Clint left the Black Widow she began to question her loyalty to her communist bosses. They would kidnap and brainwash her. They gave one order and that was to destroy the Avengers. So the Widow hires the Swordsman and <a href=\"../../atlas/29-3277/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Power Man</a> to do just that. They are quickly stopped by <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank Pym</a> in his Goliath persona. All three managed to escape. Captain America decides to split the team up to search for the <a href=\"../../black-widow/29-3200/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Widow</a> and her allies. After locating them, Clint ask Cap's permission to take the trio on by himself. It is granted, and Clint takes them on defeating the Swordsman and then going up against Power Man. Yet Power Man gains the upper hand and has Clint in a bear-hug, but Power Man is shot from behind by no other than the Black Widow. She explains to Clint about her brainwashing and Clint says he will take care of the Avengers and Shield.</p><h3>Marksman No More</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"200834\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7086/200834-17926-hawkeye_super.jpg\" title=\"Clint as Goliath\"><img id=\"200834\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7086/200834-17926-hawkeye_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Clint as Goliath\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Clint as Goliath</div></div></div></div><p>Clint started to feel like the weakest link in the team, not to mention that him and the Widow were always off on separate missions. He with the Avengers and her with <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shield</a>. Then one day Hank Pym gathered the team and told them that is giving-up on the Goliath persona and switching to Yellowjacket permanently. Clint began to think of the possibilities, when a distress signal came in and he finds out that the Widow was in trouble with a over grown monster robot. This robot was part of a scheme by <a href=\"../../egghead/29-3797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egghead</a>, <a href=\"../../mad-thinker/29-2131/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mad Thinker</a>, and the <a href=\"../../puppet-master/29-3799/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puppet Master.</a> Knowing the only way to save the woman that he loves was to take Pym's growth serum and to become <a href=\"/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a> himself. Clint saves the day and the girl. Hank Pym approves Clint on being the new Goliath.</p><h3>Surprise Visitor</h3><p>Jarvis escorts Barney Barton a well known rackets-man to the Avengers conference center where they are discussing the threat of Eggheads Space Station Death Ray. Barney announces that he has dire information about the Space Stations location. The Avengers and Barney Barton storm the Station only to be bombarded with Eggbots. Egghead uses the Puppet Master's radioactive dolls of the Avengers, that were made in their last alliance together. Barney was the only one that wasn't affected and hurls his body against the Death Ray. Barney saved the day, but at great cost to himself. Barney Barton gave his life to save the Avengers and the world from the evil genius <a href=\"../../egghead/29-3797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egghead</a> with his twisted plans of greed. Poor Barney died in Clint's arms. At this point Clint reveals his real name and brief origin to his other team-mates. Egghead disgusted over what happened with his Death Ray, blames Hank Pym ( Who he thinks is still Goliath) for his failures through the years. So he hires the Swordsman to bring Pym to him, and the Swordsman does just that. Only that Goliath is now Clint Barton. After a brief scuffle with Egghead and the Swordsman, Clint breaks it up. Both criminals are brought to justice.

Spawn of two worlds\u2026 yet fated to belong fully to none.\"</b> \u2013 Namor (Saga of the Sub-Mariner)</i>\"</p></blockquote><h3><b>Early Life</b></h3><p>Namor grew up with a\nnasty temper and hatred for the surface world, and when Tha-Korr found men in\ndiving suits near Atlantis, Namor assumed it was the beginning of an invasion\nand attacked the surface world, fighting <a href=\"/jim-hammond/29-12605/\">Jim Hammond</a>, the original Human Torch.\nBut when Nazis attacked Atlantis, he joined <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> against them.

Namor tracked down the source of the attack to a\ncave in Antarctica where he found a man called <a href=\"/destiny/29-43467/\">Destiny</a> who told him he is the\none who attacked Atlantis with his Helmet of Power. Destiny used his\nmental powers to hold the Sub-Mariner still and show him Atlantis crumbling and\nhis mother and grandfather crushed to death beneath the debris. Destiny then used his mental powers to give Namor amnesia and send him away to <a href=\"/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York</a>, where he wandered around as\na hobo for a number of years.

Namor instantly recovered\nmost of his memory and returned to where Atlantis had stood before his\nabsence. However finding it abandoned and in ruins, assumed humans had\ndestroyed it and went about warring with the surface world. He awakened the\ngiant whale like monster <a href=\"/giganto/29-63046/\">Giganto</a> and unleashed it on New York City. Namor also\ntried to claim the <a href=\"/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> as his own despite her relationship with\n<a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mister Fantastic</a>. Namor and Giganto were both defeated by the Fantastic Four and he\neventually found the new Atlantis, becoming monarch of the sub-sea empire.

If anything started it, I suppose it was when I got interested in Admiral Byrd's expedition to the South Pole. I read a lot about that. The more I read, the more intrigued I became, so when the opportunity to create a character I naturally thought of water. Jack London's adventures at sea were influential too, I use to read a lot of sea stories.\" That character was Namor.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Golden Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1588767\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27722/1588767-subbyfirst.jpg\" title=\"Namor: The Golden Age Sub-Mariner\"><img id=\"1588767\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27722/1588767-subbyfirst_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Namor: The Golden Age Sub-Mariner\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Namor: The Golden Age Sub-Mariner</div></div></div></div><p>Namor (or the Sub-Mariner as he was then known) debuted in the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age of Comics</a> and was the original <a href=\"/antiheroes/12-55830/\">anti-hero</a> of comics. Interestingly, Namor was the first super-hero who was able to fly. His meeting and subsequent battle with the original Human Torch (the android called Jim Hammond) in <a href=\"/marvel-mystery-comics/49-19137/\">Marvel Mystery Comics</a> #8 (June 1940), made comic history as it was the first superhero meeting and team-up in comics history and it established for the first time the concept of a shared fictional universe inhabited by many various superheroes in comics.</p><h3>Silver Age</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2471742\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2471742-sub_mariner__1.jpg\" title=\"Sub-Mariner #1\"><img id=\"2471742\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2471742-sub_mariner__1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sub-Mariner #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sub-Mariner #1</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a> brought Namor into the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a> in\n<a href=\"/fantastic-four/49-2045/\">Fantastic Four</a> #4 (May 1962) and thus appropriated Timely's Golden Age continuity. They also introduced the concept that the\nSub-Mariner's more outrageous Golden Age exploits were simply tales from comic\nbooks. Stan Lee made the character more formal, with the same pseudo-Shakespearean speech and mannerism he would give to <a href=\"/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a>. He also coined the phrase\n\"Imperius Rex!\u201d -\nmeaning of royal command - and depicted Namor's undersea city as being the\nmythical city of Atlantis. Lee\u2019s stories for Namor took a decided\nfantasy turn. After appearing as a protagonist in both Fantastic Four and <a href=\"/the-avengers/49-2128/\">The Avengers</a>, Namor slowly turned into more of an <a href=\"/antiheroes/12-55830/\">antihero</a> than an outright villain. He eventually appeared in his own on going feature stories alongside <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">The Hulk</a> in <a href=\"/tales-to-astonish/49-2008/\">Tales To Astonish</a>. The popularity of the series ultimately led to both antiheroes being given their own ongoing monthly titles and the acclaimed first issue of <a href=\"/sub-mariner/49-2413/\">Sub-Mariner</a> was released in May 1968.</p><h3>Bronze Age</h3><p>Namor's first wife, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dorma/29-12601/\">Lady Dorma</a> was murdered and he abdicated.</p><h3>Modern Age</h3><p>Namor joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, for a brief period the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a> and later <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>' <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Namor teamed up with another Fantastic Four enemy, <a>Doctor Doom</a>. Together they planned to launch the <a>Baxter Building</a> into the Sun and kill the team. But Namor was betrayed by Doom and once he realized this, he helped his enemies to avoid their fate. Namor's next approach to destroy the Four was to use their monetary problems against them. Amassing a fortune from the bottom of the sea, Namor offered them one million dollars to film a Fantastic Four movie with him as director. But the stages were not for actors, Namor planned various scenes that would result in the death of the members. They overcame their challenges and Namor leaves defeated, telling them to make the film anyway.</p><p>Namor however not only acted as an enemy to the Fantastic Four but also to the <a>Mighty Avengers</a> as well. When then teammate The <a>Hulk</a> abandoned the team and turned against his fellow Avengers Namor joined him in battle. Namor later accidentally freed his former ally <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> after finding him trapped in ice and then throwing him into the ocean causing it to melt leading Rogers to join the Avengers.</p><p>Namor then began the search for his people, planning to reunite with them and take his rightful place as their leader and the leader of the planet. This was stalled when the <a>Puppet Master</a> gained control over him, using him to get his revenge on the Fantastic Four. After luring in the Invisible Woman, who had been secretly searching for him, Namor dared the rest of the team to come to his undersea lair and battle him. With the use of strange ocean creatures he nearly succeeded. When the giant octopus Namor used to attack the Invisible Woman was thrown out of the lair it attacked the Puppet Master in his submarine. Busy with the threat, his control over Namor slipped away. Namor had no memory of the incident and began his search for his people once more.</p><p>After eventually finding his people and regaining his throne, Namor was soon overthrown by the traitorous <a href=\"/krang/29-13401/\">Warlord Krang</a>. In order to win back his thrown Namor had to undertake a perilous quest to find the fabled <a href=\"/trident-of-neptune/18-56534/\">Trident of Neptune</a> and prove himself worthy as the true ruler of Atlantis. On completing his quest and returning to Atlantis Namor thought he had been betrayed by his beloved <a href=\"/dorma/29-12601/\">Lady Dorma</a> when in fact Droma was tricked by Krang to escape with him in exchange for her Prince's safety. The Sub-Mariner eventually rescued Dorma after chasing Krang to New York, on the way once again falling victim to the mind control of the Puppet Master and battling with <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>. After rescuing Dorma, Namor faced many further challenges to his rule from enemies such as his cousin <a href=\"/byrrah/29-2179/\">Byrrah</a> and the barbarian <a href=\"/attuma/29-15779/\">Attuma</a>, who successfully managed to enslave Atlantis while Namor was away in Antarctica battling Destiny.</p><h3>The Man Called Destiny</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2474724\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2474724-destiny.jpg\" title=\"Paul Destine runs for President\"><img id=\"2474724\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2474724-destiny_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Destine runs for President\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Paul Destine runs for President</div></div></div></div><p>While trying to piece together the missing fragments of his memory, Namor would face one of his greatest foes. Destiny, wearer of the Helmet of Power and the murderer of Namor's mother and grandfather, would draw Namor to him using his mental powers, While facing his foe, Namor would learn about his past and finally fully regain his memory. However Destiny defeated Namor and left him for dead in an Antarctic cavern, leaving to carry out his plan for world domination by running for President of the United States and hypnotising the public during his election campaign. But Namor would eventually catch up with Destiny who, thinking himself more powerful then the helmet of power, threw the headpiece away and stepped off a rooftop. Unable to levitate without the helmet, the mad villain essentially committed suicide.</p><h3>The Spell of The Serpent</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2478960\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2478960-sub_mariner__9.jpg\" title=\"Namor is captured by The Priestess of Naga\"><img id=\"2478960\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/11/117610/2478960-sub_mariner__9_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Namor is captured by The Priestess of Naga\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Namor is captured by The Priestess of Naga</div></div></div></div><p>After Destiny\u2019s death, Namor took the\nHelmet of Power to Atlantis for safe keeping and ordered it to be placed in the\nHall of Science for research. One night the helmet gave off an\neerie glow and its outer casing shattered to reveal the <a href=\"/serpent-crown/18-15780/\">Serpent Crown</a>. When\nNamor left Atlantis to help cure <a href=\"/tiger-shark/29-6815/\">Tiger Shark</a>, Dorma convinces <a href=\"/ikthon/29-29566/\">Ikthon</a> to show her the Helmet of Power and\nas they gaze at its changed form, they were hypnotised. On Namor\u2019s return he was\nshot by a guard who told him the new ruler of Atlantis was <a href=\"/naga/29-29577/\">Naga</a>, the Serpent of\nLife and Death. The Sub-Mariner was captured and placed on a sacrificial altar\nby order of the Priestess of Naga who was none other than Dorma. Realising all his subjects were under the Serpent's spell, Namor broke\nfree of his chains and snatched the crown from Dorma. He then left Atlantis to figure out what powers the Serpent Crown contained.</p><p>While attempting\nto discover the Serpent Crown\u2019s secrets, the Sub-Mariner encountered <a href=\"/karthon/29-29564/\">Karthon\nthe Quester</a> who was on a mission to reclaim the crown for his master Naga. Namor\ndefeated Karthon who told him the crown was stolen centuries ago from Naga by a\nrebel group of Lemurians that came to be known as The Ancients. It was the\nAncients who hid the Serpent Crown inside the Helmet of Power to stop it from\nfalling into the wrong hands. A sudden attack by <a href=\"/captain-barracuda/29-29567/\">Captain Barracuda</a> allowed\nKarthon to escape with the crown and head to <a href=\"/lemuria/34-55791/\">Lemuria</a>. Namor followed and came\nface to face with the maniacal Naga who on receiving the Serpent Crown killed a\nnumber of his own people to show Namor his power. Namor was then forced to\nparticipate in the deadly Tournament of Doom where he had to fight to the death\nagainst a number of opponents, eventually defeating them all. After his victoy\nthe Sub-Mariner turned to face Naga but the overlord killed Karthon\u2019s sister\nLlyna in a fit of madness. In vengeance Karthon slayed Naga from behind and the\nLemurians chose the man who freed them from Naga\u2019s tyranny as their new leader.</p><h3>Defender</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"368526\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders_super.jpg\" title=\"The Defenders\"><img id=\"368526\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/368526-33672-defenders_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Defenders\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Defenders</div></div></div></div><p>Despite his long time hostility to the surface Namor was convinced into helping <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a> in a battle against forces known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/undying-ones/29-27708/\">Undying Ones</a>. Soon the duo became a trio after being joined by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>. The trio soon became known as The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/defenders/65-26333/\">Defenders</a>. However the team had no real alliance and often didn't even like each other but various threats kept causing them to ban together. They soon began to take on new members such as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-surfer/29-2502/\">Silver Surfer</a>. Soon other heroes <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nighthawk/29-4832/\">Nighthawk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patsy-walker/29-3316/\">Hellcat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valkyrie/29-6809/\">Valkyrie</a> joined and others aided but where often called Defenders or later more precisely \"Defenders for a day.\"</p><p>Namor worked with the team when they fought against demons from various Hells who attempted to merge them into one and even against his enemies and allies the Avengers when both teams where tricked by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a>. Yet he along with the main four members would soon finally depart the team as they always intended.</p><p>Once again becoming ruler of Atlantis and the Atlanteans also fighting against those who wished to harm his city of his reign such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/attuma/29-15779/\">Attuma</a> who for years wanted to rule Atlantis even turning <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dorma/29-12601/\">Lady Dorma</a> against him for a short time. It was around this time that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tiger-shark/29-6815/\">Tiger Shark</a> appeared, a swimmer whose DNA was mixed with that of Namor's and a tiger shark. He would go on to trouble Namor for years to come. Namor finally married his great love and cousin <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dorma/29-12601/\">Dorma</a> or so he believed. It soon came to light that he had truly wed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/llyra/29-2178/\">Llyra</a>. Llyra was like Namor a human merman hybrid but ruled over <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lemuria/34-55791/\">Lemuria</a> and its people. After discovering the truth, Namor searched for Dorma and discovered that Llyra had taken her to the surface. He hoped to free her from Llyra but she exposed Dorma to the surface by breaking her tank causing her death.</p><h3>Abdication</h3><p>After many years Namor was finally able to reunite himself with his father, however Llyra soon captured his father and along with Tiger Shark attempted to finish off Namor. In the end <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tiger-shark/29-6815/\">Tiger Shark</a> killed Leonard as the villains made their escape from battle. Namor at a time also caused his people to become dormant by accidentally releasing a type of nerve gas that also damaged his ability to breathe air. Using a suit made by Reed Richard he was able to continue his adventures on land and only after teaming with Doctor Doom to defeat the Red Skull did Doom revive the Atlanteans and give the Sub-Mariner his powers back. Namor would also finally meet Namorita and allowed her to be cared for by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/betty-dean/29-36300/\">Betty Prentiss</a>. He was often known for being over protective of her despite her own career as an adventurer and even later member of the New Warriors.</p><h3>Avenger</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1121186\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55549/1121186-688095_marrina12_super_super.jpg\" title='Marrina As \"Leviathan\"'><img id=\"1121186\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55549/1121186-688095_marrina12_super_medium.jpg\" alt='Marrina As \"Leviathan\"' /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Marrina As \"Leviathan\"</div></div></div></div><p>After the death of his wife. Namor for a time thought of a romance with his teammate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valkyrie/29-6809/\">Valkryie</a> but his feelings for Dorma made this impossible. Despite this Namor once again found love in the form of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marrina/29-12600/\">Marrina</a>. Marrina was alien member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/plodex/65-57619/\">Plodex</a> species. Arriving on earth and growing into adulthood, she became part of the Canadian super hero team <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a>. Marrina was troubled with the discovery of her true savage alien form but she was able to become normal once again. She left her teammates at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a> to be with Namor even creating the new undersea kingdom of Deluvia. The Sub-Mariner even joined his long time ally Captain America in joining the Avengers with his wife. The alliance was pivotal in freeing Marrina from the clutches of Attuma. However their happiness soon came to an end when Marrina became aware of her pregnancy and her savage form the Leviathan was released. Namor had no choice but to euthanize his love with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ebony-blade/18-46939/\">Ebony Blade</a>.</p><h3>Atlantis Attacks and Death</h3><p>The forces of the sea dwelling peoples soon joined forces against the surface. Led by Attuma, Llyra and Ghaur they made attacks against humans. Attempts at resurrecting the evil god <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/set/29-29092/\">Set</a> were made using the Serpent Crown. Nearly all superheroes became involved in protecting the surface from the Atlanteans, Set and his followers. In the beginning it seemed as though the Sub-Mariner had fallen in battle. This was later revealed to be false when Namor, The Avengers, and the Fantastic Four fought against Set's forces but for a time he allowed the world to believe he had indeed been slain.</p><h3>Oracle Inc.</h3><p>Namor soon discovered the truth of why he would often act violent and uncontrolled. Carrier and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/caleb-alexander/29-54269/\">Caleb Alexander</a> explained to him his body required him to spend equal amounts of time in both the sea and above it. To allow him to counteract his anger issues he was given a monitoring device. He soon went on to establish Oracle Inc. dedicated to providing safety to sea life. Namor soon suffered the loss of his wings in a battle with a filth being called Sluji.</p><p>Later his mother Fen seemed to return but this later only proved to be a trick by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/artys-gran/29-63845/\">Artys Gran</a> and her husband <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/suma-ket/29-12602/\">Suma-Ket</a>. Namor was killed by Suma-Ket but the great sea god <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/neptune/29-13899/\">Neptune</a> gave him back his life and his wings again. With help from allies Namor defeated the evil couple and regained his city and company.</p><p>The Sub-Mariner made another attempt at winning the love of Sue Storm Richards after Reed Richards vanished. Namor filled his spot on the team. His attempts at making the Invisible Woman love him failed as Llyra impersonated her and tricked Namor into another relationship even giving birth to a child Namor for a time thought was his own. The evil witch <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morgan-le-fay/29-13925/\">Morgan Le Fey</a> brought a terrible danger to the city of Atlantis when she raised it to the surface, killing the majority of its people and Namor took his leave of the Fantastic Four.</p><h3>Onslaugth and the Defenders revived</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"776392\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35895/776392-defenders_order_2_super.jpg\" title=\"The Order\"><img id=\"776392\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35895/776392-defenders_order_2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Order\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Order</div></div></div></div><p>Namor was one of the heroes to stand against the evil mutant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a> and who was thought dead but was saved by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a> and lived in a pocket dimension for a short while. Later after his return Namor joined the four core members of the Defenders once again but not as they had done in the past. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange's</a> long time rival <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/yandroth/29-11366/\">Yandroth</a> had cursed the group. It caused them to unwilling respond the grand threats and soon twisted them into wanting to rule the world as The Order. The Order was soon opposed by many heroes including the Avengers and their fellow Defenders. Namor's cousin Namorita even took up arms against the cursed Namor till the Defenders freed the Order from the curse.</p><h3>Illuminati</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"134973\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5634/134973-170249-illuminati_super.jpg\" title=\"The Illuminati\"><img id=\"134973\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5634/134973-170249-illuminati_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Illuminati\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Illuminati</div></div></div></div><p>Namor was one of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illuminati/65-40421/\">Iluminati</a>, a group of leaders and influential people, brought together by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a>. Namor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Charles Xavier</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">Black Bolt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Dr Strange</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> comprise the group, with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a> invited as well, but he declined. While he agreed with T'challa's concerns about the Illuminati, Namor decided he could better safeguard Atlantean interests if he accepted Tony Stark's offer to join. But he insisted the Illuminati be a secret organization, and they would meet and exchange important information to prevent planet wide catastrophes.</p><p>Perhaps because they were both rulers, Namor's closest ally among the Illuminati was Black Bolt. When dealing with the mutant Inhuman Beyonder, Namor spoke for the Inhuman king. Otherwise, Namor was often the dissenting voice in the group, usually bluntly pointing out truths the other members wished to avoid. He was against Tony Stark's proposal to support the Super-Human Registration Act, as well as the plan to shoot the Hulk into space. Namor delivered the killing stroke to the SkrullBolt when it revealed itself to the Illuminati. He was given the orange Time Gem to hide and keep safe, after the Illuminati recovered the Infinity Gems at the insistence of Reed Richards.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>His only care in Civil War is the murder of the Atlantean Princess <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namorita/29-2113/\">Namorita</a>, who was killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/29-3160/\">Nitro</a> in the Stamford explosion while she was trying to stop him. Namor ordered the capture of Nitro, at first in battle with Wolverine because he felt guilty and promised to stop Nitro. But soon the two saw eye to eye and with the help of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, Nitro became an \"honorary guest\" in an Atlantean prison. During the final battle of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, Namor helped Captain America by leading an attack with several Atlantean warriors because of his opposition to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human Registration Act</a>.</p><h3>World War Hulk</h3><p>Prior to the events of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/world-war-hulk/39-42294/\">World War Hulk</a>, Namor is the only one who opposed the idea of exiling the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a> for reasons that he will just come back even angrier than before. It seemed as Namor made the right choice in doing so, but his prediction came true. The Hulk did return and took revenge on the members of the Illuminati, only Namor was left alone by The Hulk because he opposed to the idea of sending him away. His cousin Namora who had since been revealed as alive and well joined the forces allied with the Hulk.</p><h3>The Initiative</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sub-mariner-revolution/49-28300/\">Sub-Mariner Revolution</a> starts with a large explosion which wipes out entire city of Stamford in Kansas. Iron Man and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">S.H.I.E.L.D</a>. immediately go to the location to find out what happened. Not long after they find a corpse nearby of a normal human man, however gills had been carved into his neck and traces of Atlantean DNA had been found. All blame pointed to the Atlanteans. In the meantime some of the Atlanteans question Namor's allegiance because of his continuous affairs with the world above the sea. Iron Man decided to contact Namor about the attack, but Namor had no knowledge about it and told Iron Man to stay out of it and that he would find the perpetrators himself. Of course Iron Man did not agree, after much deliberation Iron Man decided to send a military force to Atlantis until the situation was resolved. But Namor needed to go to the surface to find out what happened for himself, after giving command to his trusty general Argos Namor took off on his own. He managed to break through the lines after a short struggle with Iron Man and visited the blast site himself and there he found an Atlantean artifact.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296907\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/296907-187117-namor_super.jpg\" title=\"Venom Fails\"><img id=\"296907\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/296907-187117-namor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Venom Fails\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Venom Fails</div></div></div></div><p>He decided he needed help and went to the X-mansion to get it. He briefly fought with Wolverine, who thought Namor was a terrorist. But they were quickly interrupted by Professor X. He helped Namor locate the splinter cells in America, 12 of which Namor had sent, and one he knew nothing of. Namor asked Professor X to pin point their location, but appalled at foreign spies on American soil, Xavier decided not to help Namor further, and sent him away. As he left the mansion two <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">sentinels</a> ambushed Namor, but he quickly disposed of them, without taking any damage. In the meantime some Atlanteans in Atlantis were plotting to take over when Namor was away. But Namor's trusty general held the city for Namor's return. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a> had received orders to engage Namor. As Namor flew by he was shot in the back by a weapon and got into a fight with him.</p><p>It ended with Namor winning, but not without cost. Venom had ripped off two ankle wings, so now he had difficulty flying. He went to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Sue Richards</a> (Invisible Woman) for help. When she came to him for the Civil War, Namor answered. Now it was time for her to do the same thing for him, yet she refused which led Namor to believe he had no more allies on the surface world. However, she did give him the Fantasticar to help him in his travel.</p><blockquote><p><b>\"I am king of Atlantis! I must protect my citizens, whatever the risk!

Namor raced towards it in an attempt to stop it, and for the first time he met the rogue splinter cell. In the meantime the coup in Atlantis was in full progress. But Argos, Namor's general, had found out about it and met them in battle. Namor had already engaged in battle with the splinter cell and found out one of them was his son, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kamar/29-48135/\">Kamar</a>, who was out for revenge. Namor tried to explain to him that he banished him for his own safety, but he wouldn\u2019t listen. After Namor had defeated the splinter cell he took them down to Atlantis and was just in time to stop the coup there and show who was responsible, his son Kamar. He had also found out that one of the Atlanteans from the splinter cell had siphoned Nitro\u2019s power, the man who killed Namorita in the Civil War. His city had been compromised and he had enough of the involvement with the humans, he decided to evacuate the city through old tunnels running through the ground, the civilians would live amongst the humans, not in one city anymore.</p><p>And his army would go with him to a remote location. He made the preparations for the destruction of Atlantis, he would use Nitro (whom was still in his jail) to blow up the entire city like a time bomb and chain his son to the crown to die with the Nitro and the city as punishment for his betrayal. The city was evacuated and then blown up and completely destroyed only leaving some wreckage behind, the dead skeleton was still on his thrown. At first Iron Man believed this to be Namor but after further research it appeared to be his son. No other bodies were found in the destroyed city and they could only guess where they had gone to as they found the large tunnels. Atlantis was no more. But Namor and his army found refuge in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/latveria/34-41031/\">Latveria</a>. Dr. Doom's country. With him he would join the Cabal.</p><h3>The Cabal</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"678688\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/678688-cabal_super.jpg\" title=\"The Cabal\"><img id=\"678688\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/678688-cabal_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Cabal\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Cabal</div></div></div></div><p>After the events of the destruction of Atlantis it became clear that Namor had joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cabal/65-56051/\">Cabal</a>. Their intentions were clear, to rule the world with each member having their own motives, Namor's being the world under the sea. The team consisted out of six members, Namor, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Dr. Doom</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">The Hood</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osbourne</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a>. It has recently been shown that Namor had a relationship with Emma Frost.</p><p>Namor joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-x-men/65-56445/\">Dark X-Men</a> at Frost's request. However, this was a ploy in order to free all of the mutants that Osborn &amp; his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">Dark Avengers</a> had arrested. At the same time, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> put into action his plan to relocate the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/utopia/34-56536/\">Utopia</a>, an island floating in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a> Bay. After turning the tables on Osborn, Namor made good on his promised alliance with the mutants and helped them set up Utopia, as well as fought alongside the X-Men against the Dark Avengers.</p><p>Osborn sent a monster <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/plodex/65-57619/\">Plodex</a>, who in her humanoid state had been Namor's wife Marrina, to kill anything Atlantean. With the help of the X-Men, Namor was able to destroy her. He formed a partnership with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>, working towards an Atlantean/Mutant joint haven. New Atlantis is currently being constructed beneath the island, around a support column that keeps the island afloat.</p><h3>X-Men and Second Coming</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1244787\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/53216/1244787-x_force_v3_027_namor_super.jpg\" title=\"Fighting the Nimrods\"><img id=\"1244787\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/53216/1244787-x_force_v3_027_namor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting the Nimrods\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fighting the Nimrods</div></div></div></div><p>Hope Summers and Cable are finally detected back in the present timeline and Cyclops dispatches a number of X-Men to go find her but orders that Namor be left behind with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> to protect Utopia. However he does so by telling him that he is the most powerful one and that only he can protect them. Soon the X-Men, Cable and Hope come back just in time for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bastion/29-40568/\">Bastion</a> to attack all of San Francisco, trapping it in a giant red sphere.</p><p>Inside the red sphere, on the Golden Gate Bridge, a smaller silver sphere appears. Several <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nimrod/29-13314/\">Nimrod</a> like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a> erupt from the silver sphere and attack the X-Men. Once they are defeated, Dr. Hank McCoy asks Namor to 'stick his hand' into the sphere to gather information. For some reason, Namor does this, and is hurled away by an energy blast. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> noted that had it been anyone else they no doubt would have been killed by the force. Namor's efforts became more and more pivotal as he was one of the few mutants able to hold back the sheer number of Nimrods.</p><h3>Curse of the Mutants and Rebuilding Atlantis</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1357905\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47341/1357905-ntfm1_highlord_n_namor_super.jpg\" title=\"Fighting the Highlord\"><img id=\"1357905\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47341/1357905-ntfm1_highlord_n_namor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fighting the Highlord\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fighting the Highlord</div></div></div></div><p>Namor's efforts at rebuilding his kingdom and reuniting his people suffered a setback when he agreed to help the vampire besieged X-Men. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atlantean-sect/65-57635/\">Aqueos</a>, the Atlantean sect of vampires, had taken the head of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dracula/29-7206/\">Dracula</a> and hid it in the ocean depths. Namor discovered the whereabouts of the Aqueos, fought their leader, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/highlord/29-73088/\">Highlord</a>, and retrieved Dracula's head. This conflict broke the Shallow Peace that had existed between the two water breathing groups, and instigated an Aqueos attack on New Atlantis. After fending off the Aqueos, Namor consulted his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/logomancer/29-74601/\">Royal Logomancer</a> who provided him with part of a spell to end the Aqueos forever, if the Prince was willing to pay the cost. Namor, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tridents/65-57780/\">Tridents</a>, and what <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/atlanteans/65-13407/\">Atlantean</a> troops he can muster return to the hidden city of the Aqueos. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/abira/29-73087/\">Abira</a> and Namor find the Tomb, where the oldest of the Aqueos rest, and the last part of the spell is hidden. Before Namor can complete the ritual, the Highlord arrived and revealed his Atlantean identity. Outside, the Atlanteans battled the Aqueos to buy their Prince time, and are aided by the arrival of the Royal Logomancer and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loa/29-40672/\">Loa</a>, who have discovered a way to weaken the Aqueos -- and Loa learned she could breathe underwater. After a struggle, and with Abira's help, Namor defeated the Highlord and completed the spell. Most of the Aqueos are destroyed, and Namor restores the Shallow Peace with the few that remain.</p><p>Loa's ability to breath underwater comes from a locket she inherited from her grandmother, Alice Ryan -- Betty Dean's roommate during WWII. The locket is ancient Altantean and is turning Loa into a water breather. While the Logomancer and Dr. Nemesis are investigating this, apparitions of the old Kings of Atlantis appear from the locket and drag Namor to his own hell. Doctor Doom unexpectedly shows up and transports himself, Abira, and Loa to Namor's hell. They find Namor trapped by the responsibilities of ruling, and make him angry enough to escape his self imposed prison. Doom abandons the trio at exit from hell, as the old Kings of Atlantis mount a final attack. While appearing catatonic, Abira is actually talking to an old Queen of Atlantis, who gives her the insight and power to help Namor. When Namor accepts Abira and Loa's help, they find the way out of hell. Back at New Atlantis, they are greeted by an angry Cyclops and Warlord Krang's coup attempt. Namor and Abira start a relationship.</p><p>Selach undermines Krang's challenge by killing the Royal Logomancer, forcing Krang and Namor into an alliance to save Atlantis. Abira choses to end her relationship with Namor by becoming his Royal Logomancer.</p><h3>Regenesis</h3><p>Namor is a member of Cyclops' Extinction team and was called forth to deal with the Dreaming Celestial who Mr. Sinister has taken control of. When a ceasefire was ordered, the team went to Sinister's palace where he took control of the team telepathically, save for Emma who was in diamond form. Due to a pre-programmed word, Emma set Hope free by making her transform into diamond form where Hope took off. Finding a vantage point, Hope shot Sinister through the head which freed Namor and the team,but Sinister predicted this and the team learns his copies are a giant hive mind. Namor continues to fight the Sinister species. He held Emma's arm when she released her diamond form as a tourniquet so she could telepathically assault the hive-mind. He was there with the team when they stared down the Celestials.</p><p>With a mysterious new habitat known called the Tabula Rasa appearing, Namor is deployed along with the extinction team where are split apart in pairs. Namor goes with Hope where they explore the aquatic portion of the habitat where the two are confronted by a monstrous creature. Namor and Hope fight off the creatures but Namor comes to explain that the creatures think Namor and Hope are enemies, which Namor wishes to change. Namor and Hope enter the Queen's chambers of the sea creatures where Namor appeases to the Queen establishing a friendship with their species, hoping for an alliance somewhere along in the future. He talks with Hope and tells her she is invited to Atlantis anytime she wants.</p><p>Namor has a talk with Emma while she is training about how losing her arm could have been shocking to such a beautiful woman. She leaves him but thanks him for being concerned. He was deployed with the Extinction team and helped them defeat some Peak prison escapees. They leave the Avengers to go fight Unit who has Hope. <a href=\"/unit/29-4467/\">Unit</a> hits Emma Frost and Namor with a pheromone blast causing them to become intimate with each other on the battlefield. After Unit's defeat, the team heads home.</p><h3><a href=\"/avengers-vs-x-men/39-56674/\">Avengers vs X-men</a></h3><p>Namor fights with the Thing and Luke Cage and again in Tabula Rasa. Namor knocks out Cage and batters She-Hulk with him. He faces off against the Thing with what appears to be a stalemate until the Savage arrives and interrupts what he thinks is a mating ritual. Magik arrives and gets Namor out of there where the X-Men figure out Hope is heading towards the moon. After Iron Man, using a special suit, dispersed the Phoenix Force into five pieces. Namor along with Emma, Cyclops, Magik and Colossus are now each imbued a shards and become the <a href=\"/phoenix-five/65-59234/\">Phoenix Five</a>. They remake the world into a better place, but are still attacked by the Avengers, which prompts the Phoenix Five to hunt them down.</p><p>Emma meets with Namor who is disgusted at Cyclops leadership and that <a href=\"/transonic/29-72484/\">Transonic</a> is imprisoned. Emma tells him she is in Wakanda but Scott doesn't know.</p><p>Namor invades Wakanda declaring war. Atlanteans invade the city and Namor assaults the Avengers. He gives them all they can handle and just doesn't seem stoppable. The Avengers call out Wanda who exchanges an energy blast with Namor. The blast exchange results with both him and her being knocked out. The rest of the Phoenix Five show up and in Namor's defeat his portion of the Phoenix Force leaves him and is then spread amongst the remaining avatars.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Sub-Mariner is one of the strongest mutants in the Marvel Universe being classified as a Class 100 character. When Namor is underwater his strength has been stated to be virtually unmatched. Namor is strong enough to lift hundreds of thousands of tons and hold his own in hand to hand combat with the Hulk, Thor as well as the Blue Marvel. He has superhuman stamina, durability, agility and speed, but his powers slowly decrease as he spends time out of the water. He can survive indefinitely in water or on land, and is able to withstand all pressure and cold in the sea. He has the durability to withstand the pressure of the depths of the ocean, extreme heat temperatures, and sonic attacks.</p><p>Although being deprived of water for long periods can make him ill and relatively weak, he once spent several years living as an amnesiac human in the Bowery region of New York after being mind wiped by Paul Destine. He can swim at speeds of over 300 knots. He also has an extended lifespan being over 90 years old, yet physically still in his prime. Namor also has the ability to channel the powers of any aquatic life in the sea. For example, channeling the power of an electric eel and shooting electric bolts from his hands. He has also used radar powers like a blind fish to see Sue Storm whilst she was invisible.</p><p>All Atlantean magic flows from Namor, their king. His royal blood also is a magic ingredient that can be used in spells.</p><p><b>Mutant Power</b></p><p>Namor's mutant power are the wings on his ankles which appear to allow him to fly and his greater degree of strength. Namor was actually the first comic book character with the power of flight, already flying in his second comic book appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-comics/49-18577/\">Marvel Comics #1</a>, while all other contemporary characters like Captain Marvel, Superman and Wonder Woman only could leap great distances and didn't fly canonically until several months later.</p><p>His skin is very resistant to any physical damage, he can resist bullet fire with ease and is fireproof.</p><h4>Skills</h4><p>Due to Namor's extended lifespan and fighting in many wars and battles, he is a seasoned hand-to-hand combatant. He is also a capable weapons user such as using swords and spears but Namor prefers using his hands in battle.</p><h2>Physical Characteristics</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296856\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/296856-193361-namor_super.jpg\" title=\"Namor's Hero Identification Card\"><img id=\"296856\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/296856-193361-namor_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Namor's Hero Identification Card\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Namor's Hero Identification Card</div></div></div></div><p><b>Sex:</b> Male</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Black</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</p><p><b>Height:</b> 6'2\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 278 lbs</p><h2>Personality</h2><p>Namor is the original \"hotheaded\" character in the Marvel cast of characters. He has been shown to act very impulsively with a short temper. Other times he can be quite civil. Caleb Alexander hypothesized in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor-the-sub-mariner/49-4406/\">Namor, the Sub-Mariner</a> that Namor's mood swings might be due to his hybrid nature, and more specifically an oxygen imbalance in his blood, that could be remedied by spending equal time above and below the waves. However, there is evidence to suggest Alexander's theory is not completely sound, and seems to ignore the Namor's upbringing and social status in Atlantis.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trident-of-neptune/18-56534/\">Sacred Trident of Neptune</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/horn-of-proteus/18-56533/\">Horn of Proteus</a></p><p>Personal Flagship</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p>In most realities, Namor retains his essential traits and abilities.

Like pre-Cataclysm Atlantis, Benasylum was an island of magic and advanced sciences, and its people do not breathe water and are not blue, though they do have pointed ears. Unlike Namor, Numeor had no powers, except one. His bloodline allowed him to safely wield the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/trident-of-neptune/18-56534/\">Trident of Poseidon</a>. Numenor could fly with aid of winged sandals.</p><p>Count Otto Von Doom, along with the Frightful Four, and the Fantastick Four, crossed the Atlantic to find Benasylum. Seeing Numenor's infatuation with Susan Storm, Doom offered an alliance against Sir Richard Reed and Captain Benjamin Grimm to win the lady for the Emperor. But the allies turned on each other and Doom attempted to wrest the Trident from Numenor, who was wounded with the weapon. This appeared to destroy the magical bonds of Benasylum, and the island sank.

Princess Fen and McKenzie move to Honolulu, and live in a subdivision of houses for military support staff. Princess Fen dies in child birth, but not before naming their son Namor and forbidding the captain to allow their son to return to the sea. Later on Namor is goaded by fellow residents to jump into the water with them. Staying defiant Namor tells them he can't swim. He walks home and is introduced to King Thak-kor of Atlantis, his grandfather. He is there to force Namor to choose between continuing his life on land or take his place as prince of Atlantis. He attacks the king, but is interrupted by loud BOOMS in the distance. Namor runs to see Japanese fighter jets bombing Pearl Harbor.

Namor attacks one of the slave-masters and sees that he is a Nazi and an Atlantean-human hybrid calling themselves the Wasserreich or The Reign of Water. Suddenly an Atlantean uprising occurs that allows Namor to break into their base of operations, where he sees the Torch being used as a giant bomb designed to melt the ice cap and flood the world, which would allow them to rule much easier.

He used hydrokinesis to create a gigantic tidal wave in the shape of Poseidon and threatened to use it to destroy Manhattan rather than lose to the Four. His extreme intelligence allowed him to become fluent in English in a matter of minutes merely by listening to the FF and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents talking. Undefeated, he was appeased with a kiss from Sue Storm while an infuriated Reed Richards looked on, held back by the Thing.

This version is also blue skinned. She first appeared in Exiles #46. She was ported in with the rest of the Exiles. Blink introduces everyone to her and tells her what they must do. Namora slaps her hand away asking her is it all right that they were taken from their homes and enslaved? When the Exiles try to figure out what the Tallus wants them to do, Namora starts to walk off. Heather grabs her and tells her she cannot go. She then punches Heather (in her Sasquatch from) and throws her hundreds of yards into the water. She then fights the Exiles and dives in the water saying they will thank her later. She goes to Atlantis and sits on the throne for Namor to see. They have a quick tussle and she tells him she is him from another reality and that his realm is in danger. They go to the Baxter building - Namor hits her and they dump her in a water tank that can hold her.</p><p>Namora starts to tell the Fantastic Four and Namor about her reality. She said when she was little she would swim away from Atlantis. When a shark tried to eat her she ripped it in half. That was when she found out she was invulnerable and that she was Atlantis' first and only mutant - until years later when Attuma was born. He thought his powers were given to him by the gods and that they wanted him to become king. He killed the Queen and any others that might replace her. He was then defeated by Namora, but coming too late to save the Queen she was instead <i>made</i> Queen. She was going to start a war on Earth when she saw that the humans were a danger to all life, but was contacted by Charles Xavier asking her to hold off this war. So she did. She made friends with Xavier and the X-Men until Magneto attacked an Air Force carrier. Namora and the X-Men stopped him but the pictures got out. Humans then started enforcing anti-mutant laws where they would have to go to jail. Xavier gave up but Namora didn't. She then started a war on Earth and killed all the super heroes that opposed her. Namora stated that the Fantastic Four were the hardest she had to fight.</p><p>Namora tells the Exiles that the Timebroker is telling them he is a figment of their imagination so they won't turn on him. Namora is with the Exiles when they are consumed by a spell on a planet where everyone is in medieval ways until they were cut by Magik's soul sword, which cancels magic. <i>Exiles</i></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"711093\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/711093-manganamor_super.jpg\" title=\"Mangaverse\"><img id=\"711093\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/711093-manganamor_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Mangaverse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Mangaverse</div></div></div></div><p><b>Earth-2301</b></p><p>In the Mangaverse Namor allied with Baron Strucker to invade the surface world.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1476968\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47341/1476968-wemckenzie_crop_2_super.jpg\" title=\"Dormammuverse\"><img id=\"1476968\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/4/47341/1476968-wemckenzie_crop_2_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dormammuverse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dormammuverse</div></div></div></div><p><b>Earth-5113</b></p><p>In this reality created by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dormammu/29-2205/\">Dormammu</a>, Namor is a mostly human William Everett McKenzie.

So <a href=\"../../syan/29-59942/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'yan</a>, T'Chaka's young brother &amp; T'Challa's uncle under took the Black Panther trials. S'yan passed and became the Black Panther.

The two broke off there relationship off due to his need to avenge his father\u2019s death &amp; to become the type of man who could lead the nation of Wakanda, but they would see each other over the years when they could.

While members of the FF T'Challa and Ororo help save <a href=\"../../gravity/29-40452/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gravity</a>, team up with Michael Collins (<a href=\"../../deathlok/29-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deathlok</a>) and <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a> and battle the <a href=\"../../frightful-four/65-11439/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frightful Four</a>, some of the <a href=\"../../heralds-of-galactus/65-40462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heralds of Galactus</a>, <a href=\"../../marvel-zombies/65-15411/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel Zombies</a>, <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrulls</a>, <a href=\"../../psycho-man/29-7112/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psycho-Man</a>, save Reed Richard's life and stopped a rip in the space-time continuum from destroying universe. Once Reed and Sue settled there differences, they rejoined the FF, and both T'Challa and Ororo left the team.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>When the Skrulls try to infiltrate and take over Wakanda for their vibranium ore in their invasion an all out battle between the forces of Wakanda and the forces of the <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrulls</a> begins. Black Panther decisively defends his nation with cunning tactics and the rallying of his soldiers. Eventually the two opponents find themselves at a loss of technological weaponry. After this happens the forces break out older weapons to continue the conflict. Black Panther holds back the <a href=\"../../super-skrulls/65-57545/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Skrulls</a> (including a massively large Skrull with the powers of <a href=\"../../iron-fist/29-1492/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"../../luke-cage/29-1450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Luke Cage</a> and <a href=\"../../bullseye/29-4647/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bullseye</a>), while his legion fends off the infantry.

Next he and Ororo used Wakandan made vocal manipulators and flesh transmuters to disguise themselves while on board the ship. Also they used the same vocal manipulators and flesh transmuters on the Skrulls who they allowed to captured them fooling the other Skrulls to believe they captured the real Black Panther and Storm. T'Challa and Ororo then revealed themselves to Commander K'VVR by killing him and then proceeded to kill every Skrull on the ship. While <a href=\"../../shuri/29-58997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shuri</a> and <a href=\"../../syan/29-59942/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S'yan</a> lead the Wakandan Army outside on the battle field and kill every Skrull outside.. Then the Wakandans loaded all of the dead Skrull bodies on the ship and sent it back to space with a message written in Skrull blood stating : THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU INVADE WAKANDA (when translated from Skrull to English)..</p><h3>Worlds Apart</h3><p>Shortly after Secret Invasion Ororo life as an X-Man and a queen comes into conflict when a mission with Cyclops is interrupted. Storm is called back home to Wakanda to investigate a murder that involved her mutant ward, <a href=\"../../gentle/29-41124/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nehzno (Gentle)</a>. During the course of the investigation Storm discovers that Nezhno was innocent and orders him freed from imprisonment. Almost immediately, she is confronted by the Wakandan military, who had advised that she is to surrender to their custody by order of the king himself. When T'Challa confronts Storm, she is immediately pulled into the astral plane and the Shadow King reveals himself to be the one who had caused Nezhno to murder the mystic, and manipulated T'Challa/the people of Wakanda and Cyclops/The X-Men.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1210950\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/1210950-did_u_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1210950\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/1210950-did_u_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Storm then prays to the panther god, <a href=\"../../panther-god/29-22575/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bast</a>, for help and is pulled into the spirit world. Bast expresses disappointment with Storm, but Storm stands her ground and proves her strength of spirit to the panther god, so back on Earth numerous black panthers run to Storm and bow to her, restoring the trust and faith of the Wakandan people in Storm and freeing them from the Shadow King control. Storm and Nezhno take off to <a href=\"../../san-francisco/34-55704/\" rel=\"nofollow\">San Francisco</a> to save the X-Men. Storm opens up the atmosphere, using her elemental powers to travel back. After a brief fight, Storm creates a tornado to take out the possessed X-Men and goes to confront Cyclops outside. Storm is able to trap the Shadow King into entering her mind where Bast had been hiding. The Shadow King is devoured by Bast in retribution for his attack on it's people/nation. Storm is able to revive Cyclops, and proves that she does not have to choose between her life as a queen and an X-Man --- she will be both..</p><h3><b>Dark Reign</b> and a New Black Panther</h3><p>After the events of the <a href=\"../../secret-invasion/39-47264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Invasion</a>, a regime change occurred in Western Society. <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a> was disbanded and Tony Stark fired, in favor of a new organization called <a href=\"../../hammer/65-56065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">H.A.M.M.E.R.</a> headed by Norman Osborn. T'Challa was surprised when he received a summons from the exiled Atlantean King, Namor. Meeting with him, T'Challa was surprised to learn of the creation of a dark group mirroring the Illuminati. Namor asked him to join in with this <a href=\"../../wikid/dark-illuminati/65-56051/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Illuminati</a>, to which he refused citing his decision with the Illuminati as reference.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"645522\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/645522-6399new_storyimage9358598_full_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"645522\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25807/645522-6399new_storyimage9358598_full_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Warning him that his country would be an Island, Namor took his leave. Getting ready to depart himself, T'Challa was surprised to find Doom waiting for him in the courtyard. Unsurprised by his refusal to join their Cabal, a battle ensued, pitting T'Challa and his <a href=\"../../dora-milaje/65-55780/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dora Milaje</a> against <a href=\"../../doctor-doom/29-1468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doom</a> and his machines. After a vicious fight that resulted in one of his Dora Milaje sacrificing her life to save a gravely injured T'Challa, he and the remaining Dora Milaje managed to escape, heading back to Wakanda. The damage done to their ship during the battle not withstanding, they managed to crash land in Wakanda, but the combination of the fight with Doom and the crash put T'Challa into a coma, and left Wakanda without a Black Panther for the first time. Storm nominated <a href=\"../../shuri/29-58997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shuri</a>, T'Challa's sister, to take up the mantle of the Black Panther.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"913695\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/913695-img004_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"913695\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/913695-img004_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>At the same time, the Lion Cult sensed the weakened Panther totem, and summoned Morlun, the devourer of totems, who rushed toward a vulnerable Wakanda to consume the Panther totem- T'Challa.

Upon his arrival to Wakanda, <a href=\"../../morlun/29-17613/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morlun</a> completely decimates the military forces, and was moments away from devouring the Panther totem when Shuri arrived.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1250396\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/1250396-ts_super.png\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1250396\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/1250396-ts_thumb.png\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Despite the seeming rejection by Bast, Shuri battled Morlun, and was able to lure him into a trap set by her and <a href=\"../../zawavari/29-60980/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zawavari</a> , a Wakandan witch doctor.

That not only did Doom attempt to assassinate him,but he also infected most of the royal family and many top aides with his Nanites (microscopic devices that relayed everything the infected heard or said). With that knowledge T'Challa was unable to tell most of his love ones &amp; his military of the identity attacker &amp; or enlist their aid (Shuri was left uninfected due to her Bast/Panther powers).</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2026683\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/2026683-bp15_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2026683\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/32791/2026683-bp15_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>So T'Challa a man of science was forced turn to magic and to go almost completely off the grid to plan to stop Doom, While Shuri acted as the Princess Regent of Wakanda and The Black Panther. T'Challa turned to Zawavari for assistant, who with his Acolytes empowered T'Challa with enhanced strength, senses and a resistance to magical attacks to say the least. Next to prepare for the coming war T'Challa with <a href=\"../../aneka/29-68046/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aneka</a> created a new combat style that blended science &amp; sorcery with their already most vicious fighting secrets to teach the Dora Milaje so they would be more ready for the coming battle. While Doom continue to fund The Desturi (a Wakandan dissident group dedicated to civil unrest) and not attack Wakanda openly knowing he'd fail. Doom's Chief of Operations <a href=\"../../walter-declun/29-43751/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Walter Declun</a> laid a trail of disinformation that able to distracted Shuri, Ororo &amp; T'Challa long enough for the Desturi under Doom command to overthrew The Panther Cult in a well coordinated coup.</p><h3>Doomwar</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1205287\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1205287-76013_border2_122_672lo_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1205287\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1205287-76013_border2_122_672lo_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>With the Desturi (Wakandans that disagree with Royal Family rule) coup successful place Ororo, S'yan and the Queen Mother in jail to wait trial.

While T'Challa, his forces and allies take control back from the Desturi, Doom manages to steal the processed vibranium. Storm, Black Panther (Shuri), the Dora Milaje and the Fantastic Four then attack Doom's networks and facilities throughout the world while T'Challa set his plan in motion to save the world with Doom becoming one with the processed vibranium, he uses his power to control any object or structure that contains vibranium to initiate attacks worldwide.

Instantly, Doom's armor is rendered useless, his newly found power is removed, and all of the processed vibranium around the world is also rendered inert. Storm destroys all the doombots in a massive multi-pronged lightning strike. The Royal family then returns to Wakanda to storing the remaining portions of the recovered pure vibranium with the aid of the X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four and others</p><h3>Black Panther: Man Without Fear</h3><p>After the events of Shadowland &amp; Doomwar T'Challa has reached an agreement with Matt Murdock and he is the new protector of Hell's Kitchen. After being forced to destroy Wakanda's vibranium reserves to defeat Doctor Doom he has relinquished the title of Black Panther to his sister Shuri. Believing his path and Murdock's recent career path to mirror each other he is seeking redemption for himself. Thanks to some help from Foggy Nelson he has established an undercover identity in Hell's Kitchen as Mr Okonkwo, the manager of the Devil's Kitchen restaurant. Through this civilian identity T'Challa is seeking to familiarize himself with his new found neighbors in the Hell's Kitchen area. Part of his new venture is relinquishing every aspect of the Black Panther identity. He no longer has his Wakandan tech, metahuman abilities or his vibranium suit. He refuses to return to Wakanda until he has redeemed himself through this personal mission and leaving Wakanda in the care of Shuri and Storm.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Thanks to the <a href=\"../../heart-shaped-herb/18-43809/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heart Shaped Herb</a> , T'Challa has enhanced speed, agility, strength, endurance, healing and senses. All of these attributes have been raised to near superhuman levels. With his enhanced senses the Black Panther can see in complete and total darkness as if it was bright as day, and can see something 100 feet as if it were right in front of him. With his sense of smell he can track someone across a continent, memorize tens of thousands of smells and can detect fear lies in a person. He can hear things that normal humans can't as well as sounds that they can, but at a distance not possible with normal ears. He can hear the breathing and heartbeats of enemies. With his sense of taste he can determine any ingredients in anything he eats. He can use his senses together to sometimes predict his opponent's moves ahead of time.</p><p>The <a href=\"../../heart-shaped-herb/18-43809/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heart Shaped Herb</a> also created a connection between T'Challa and the <a href=\"../../panther-god/29-22575/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Panther God</a>, the deity his people worship. On top of all his powers, T'Challa is a highly skilled martial artist, and is one of the greatest hand to hand fighters on the planet. He learned to fight both at home (from the best warriors in Wakanda) and abroad. When he was still a teenager he traveled the whole world to learn various skills, some academic and others focused on physical combat.</p><p>Captain America entered Wakanda during World War Two on a search-and-destroy mission. He was hunting Nazis who were out to exploit Wakandan science. Cap didn't know the Wakandans had already beheaded the Nazis days ago. Black Panther (<a href=\"../../azzari-the-wise/29-69986/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Azzari the Wise</a>)and Cap had an extended hand-to-hand battle. And Cap lost.</p><p>In addition to all his physical strengths, the Black Panther is an intellectual giant, he's one of the eight smartest people on the planet and in the marvel universe. Not only is he recognized for his brilliance by his peers across the seas, he's one of the smartest of his own people, which is impressive considering that his nation holds some of the smartest people in the world.</p><p>T'Challa is a scientist, an engineer, an inventor, a aviator, a weapons designer and a tactical and strategical genius. It is T'Challa who designed the Avengers Quinjet, and the Wakanda Design Group built it. T'Challa is also the religious leader of his people. He has access to the wisdom of the previous Wakandan chieftains, whose souls dwell in the Panther Pavilion, a holy temple within the city. Once he even encountered and fought the embodiment of his God/Tribal Totem The Panther God when it manifested to test his worthiness to remain the tribal leader and to also punish him for maintaining a policy of neutrality toward South Africa during Apartheid in the 1980's.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>T'Challa standard/day to day equipment/gear includes his Black Panther habit, Kimoyo card, anti-metals claws &amp; energy/vibro- daggers. Along with the title of Black Panther T'Challa received a habit woven with <a href=\"../../vibranium/18-40919/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vibranium</a>, a metal with the ability to absorb all vibrations and kinetic energy it comes in contact with. Vibranium is only found in Wakanda, hence the nation's need for protection. The costume negates most force directed against it and robs moving objects of kinetic energy. This keeps him protected from most attacks. Blades can cut the fabric but only if they cut along the grain. The Kimoyo card is a extremely powerful portable supercomputer invented by T'Challa that has the ability to access technological interfaces, hold T'Challa databank of the super-powered being in the Marvel U &amp; can hack into any other technological devices in the Marvel U. T'Challa also has anti-metal claws that can cut through nearly anything, including the hardest metals. The claws also have the ability to emit small energy blades from the tip as well as launch them as projectile attacks. During the beginning of his career, the finger-tips of his gloves shot out gaseous streams of a powerful sleeping agent. He also uses a vibro-dagger which is an energy dagger that he can use to cut through almost anything . His boots are also constructed with Vibranium, allowing him to land on his feet from great heights without getting hurt. He is also in possession of the royal aircraft which is know as the Talon fighter (several of which are hidden all around the world) his own VTOL aircraft. T'Challa also, using Shadow Physics (combining alchemy with quantum science) he discovered, cloaking technology, his Thrice-blessed and Light armor for specific tasks.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>X-Men: Forever (Earth 161)</h3><p>In this reality, T'Challa was born in Wakanda and became its king. He was briefly an member of the Avengers and later left to focus on ruling his land. While attending a meeting, Storm crashed into his quarters after fleeing the X-Men and she was injured. Even though Nick Fury warned T'Challa about Storm's violent parting with the X-Men, he still felt that he could trust his long-time friend and welcomed her into Wakanda. The two began to grow close to on another and T'Challa proposed to Storm. She agreed, but on the night of their wedding they were attacked by Erik Killmonger and he de-powered Storm with a special necklace and killed T'Challa's family. T'Challa challenged Erik, but was killed by him. Storm eventually killed Erik herself and it was revealed that T'Challa's death was all a plot by Storm so that she could look heroic to the Wakandan people.</p><h3>Age of Apocalypse (Earth-295)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"86654\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1012/86654-156511-black-panther.jpg\" title=\"Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse\"><img id=\"86654\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1012/86654-156511-black-panther_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Earth-295 Age of Apocalypse</div></div></div></div><p>In this alternate reality called Age of Apocalypse T'Challa was the last king of Wakanda and he was loved and worshiped by his people.

Later in life, Nick Fury asked Captain America to train Black Panther to be his student and that he will be perfect recruit for the Ultimates. After Black Panther defeated a villain, Captain America confronted him about his secrecy and silence during battle. Black Panther took off his mask and showed him his scar in the throat that he received from his battle against an actual Black Panther and that Weapon X wasn't able to fix it, thus rendering him mute. Captain America then confronted Nick Fury and asked him about T'Challa's past, but he lied to him.

A week later Captain America tells Fury that T'Challa is ready to be with the Ultimates.

He awakes and realises that his right arm and leg is missing and that Giant Man is keeping him prisoner as a source of food. With the help of Wasp, whose head remained animated, he eventually escapes the lab.

However, Gladiator and Bruce Banner gets trapped inside as well and Gladiator attacks T'Challa resulting in his death. T'Challa and the others realise they are not well-mannered enough to protect the portal that the zombies come through and Reynolds reveals that T'Challa's dead son, T'Channa is dressed as Col. America and that Reynolds and Forge have planted Col. America's brain in his son's body. T'Channa attacks his father but is then reminded of who is was. The zombies then return and they release the force field and T'Challa and the group defeat them, but Iron Man manages to get through. After the force field id de-activated by Bruce Banner, the zombies get through to the survivors, but realise they are not hungry. However, during the fight before, T'Challa gets smashed, which left him with only with his arm, leg, chest, neck and head attached and Wasp crushed from the waist up. After the zombies cope with their newly found humanity the Hulk breaks into the room, eats Reynolds and kills Iron Man, Phoenix, Firelord and Hawkeye before being stopped by Spider-Man, Giant Man and Wolverine. After getting a new body by Forge, the zombies help the survivors get supplies and breed in other dimensions. However, Malcolm Cortez, the leader of the Acolytes reveals he was behind the assassination attempt on T'Challa, T'Channa's death and a plot to kill K'Shamba, Pather's grandson. He says he likes this way of life and wants to get rid of the zombie plague and sends T'Challa to another dimension. T'Challa arrived on the reality Earth-Z in the Skrull home-world where he converted the entire species and led his own horde against this Earth's Avengers where he was slain and his arm mounted on the Avenger Tower as a trophy.</p><h3>Forge's Reality (Earth-2814)</h3><p>T'Challa made a brief appearance in this reality where Storm is married to Forge.</p><h3>Akhenaten Conquered Earth (Earth-4321)</h3><p>T'Challa made an appearance in this reality where he earth is being conquered.</p><h3>All Avengers Stayed With The Team (Earth-8234)</h3><p>T'Challa, along with the entire Avenger team was sent to stop a candy store hold up and nearly trampled Ant-Man in the process.</p><h3>Legacy Virus Merged With Warlock (Earth-8545)</h3><p>T'Challa is one of the super- powered creatures to have been turned into Vi-Lock Prime by the mutated Legacy Virus.</p><h3>Ruins (Earth-9591)</h3><p>He is known as T'Challa des Wakandas and he was a member of the Black Panther party imprisoned alongside Bobby Seale and Huey P.

However, in this reality it is revealed that the heart shape herbs that granted him his powers also gave anyone who took them the same power. however due to the nature of mutation, T'Challa's powers were partially subconscious. In the recent history this reality, Captain America gave T'Challa the Cosmic Cube of safe keepings as he believed that Panther would not use the device or give it to anyone else. During this time he married Storm and humanity began to mutate due to the Terrigen Mists in the Earth's atmosphere. Due to this, T'Challa had more of a panther appearance and at the same time the animals in Wakanda which were part of a wildlife reserve that Panther set up, began to mutate as well becoming humanoid creatures known as Ani-Men. When the Skrull began to take over the United States, Captain America asked T'Challa to give him the Cosmic Cube. Out of respect for his friend, he denied his request and did not involve himself in the final battle against the Skrulls. After the death of the Celestial embryo in the Earth's core, the axis shift of the Earth turned Africa into a frozen wasteland but thanks to Beast's technology, Wakanda to maintain its tropical ecosystem and keep out most threats.</p><p>When Mar-vel came to Wakanda in search of the Cosmetic Cube to destroy Death, T'Challa refused to give him the Cube. It wasn't until Storm was killed by a Wendigo attack and suddenly brought to life that Mar-vel revealed that the Cube was responsible for that and the mutation of the Ani-Men because it was acting on Panther's wants. This revolution mortified Panther so he handed over the Cube to Mar-vel who left to help the Wakandans relocate to the Savage Land so that they could escape the frequent Wendigo attacks that kept occurring. On the way to the Savage Land, Black Panther was followed by the Wendigo and he defeated them and discovered that they were really the Multiple Man in disguise. T'Challa and Storm helped build a new Wakanda nation in the Savage Land with the help of everyone who travelled with them. They were briefly attacked by Belasco and the Dire Wraiths but was saved by Mar-vel and his friends. A few months later, T'Challa accompanied Storm to the wedding of Medusa and King Britain where they met Bloodstorm. Bloodstorm asked Storm to perform a blood transfusion that would cure her of her vampirism. Storm agreed to the procedure and it is unknown where Black Panther went after this point.</p><h3>Cancerverse (Earth-10011)</h3><p>T'Challa is one of the heroes present as Mar-Vell lay dying.

His appearance in the Were-Panther form was of a large humanoid panther in ancient Egyptian clothing. He could also call upon Qamathas power to change himself into the <a href=\"../../falcon/29-1451/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Falcon</a>. In this form, his appearance was heavily influenced by the ancient Egyptian god Horus.

War eventually broke out between Wakanda and Atlantis when Namor flooded the Capital City of Wakanda and caused it to overgrow with vegetation making it nearly uninhabitable. In retaliation The Black Panther sent \"Panther Tanks\" to Atlantis and destroyed Namor's throne room. This led to Namor unleashing an endless horde of sea-beasts upon the now-flooded Wakandan Capital which in turn led to more strike backs from The Black Panther. The war continued until finally both Wakanda and Atlantis were laid to waste and left in total ruins.</p><h2>Television</h2><h3>Fantastic Four (1994)</h3><p>The Black Panther appears in the 'Prey Of The Black Panther' episode and is voiced by Keith David.

Langkowski went to Pennsylvania state University on a football scholarship where he met <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Bruce Banner</a> and shared thoughts on physics and gamma radiation. Banner would encourage Lankowski to peruse his research. Langkowski played American Football with the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Bay Packers</a> for three years during which time he married and had a son with an actress called Veronica. Being a multi-millionaire freed Langkowski from many constraints and he persuaded his dreams of being a scientist by getting a Ph.D in Physics from MIT and then going on to get a teaching position at the McGill University in Montreal.</p><p>During his time as a Professor of biophysics Langkowski sunk about a million dollars of his own money into Gamma radiation research motivated partly by a desire to help his old friend Bruce Banner who by now had become the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>. The research lead to an alienation with his wife who left and took his son with him. Langkowski became involved in science for <a href=\"/department-h-headquarters-toronto/34-56033/\">Department H</a> a relatively new government department making equipment and offering scientific advise. Langkowski met and befriended <a href=\"/guardian/29-5047/\">James MacDonald Hudson</a> who arranged the funding and provided Langkowski a small Arctic lab to allow the scientist to continue his research into gamma radiation.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"231031\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9690/231031-133216-sasquatch_super.jpg\" title=\"First change\"><img id=\"231031\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/9690/231031-133216-sasquatch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"First change\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">First change</div></div></div></div><p>Langkowski wanted to recreate under controlled conditions the accident that turned Banner into the Hulk. After a lot of checks Lanknowski did his experiment on himself, bombarding his body with gamma rays with the effect that he turned into a huge, 10 foot tall, orange furred beast who rampaged around before calming down and transforming back into a Human. Langkowski believed that he had acquired powers similar to the Hulk but that he could control his transformation simply by willing it (though transforming caused him a great deal of pain at first); Langknowksi attributed the orange fur to the location of the lab, reasoning that the Aurora Borealis might have had something to do with it. Langkowski named his bestial identity after the Sasquatch of Canadian myth.</p><p>In actuality, Langkowski had shattered an inter-dimensional barrier with the sear amount of power he had put out; for brief moment he had made contact with entities known as the <a href=\"/great-beasts/65-15625/\">Great Beasts</a>. Langkowski's body was fused with the essence of the Great Beast <a href=\"/tanaraq/29-40648/\">Tanaraq</a> and when he transformed he was effectively becoming the Beast but with Langkowski's mind in control. James Hudson offered Langkowski a position on the <a href=\"/alpha-flight/65-14616/\">Alpha Flight</a> superteam he was putting together. Langkowski accepted and received training from fellow Shape-shifter the mystic <a href=\"/snowbird/29-8474/\">Snowbird.</a></p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Sasquatch was created by <a href=\"/john-byrne/26-1770/\">John Byrne</a> and <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a>. Sasquatch first appeared in the Uncanny X-Men vol 1 #120 (4/1979) written by Claremont, drawn by Byrne (pencils) and <a href=\"/terry-austin/26-4109/\">Terry Austin</a> (inks). Claremont and Byrne co-plotted the storyline together.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>During the early days of Alpha Flight Langkowkski struck up a good relationship with <a href=\"/puck/29-5010/\">Puck</a> and <a href=\"/heather-hudson/29-9846/\">Heather Hudson</a>, a jealous-distrusting relationship with <a href=\"/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar,</a> and a romantic relationship with his sister <a href=\"/aurora/29-3189/\">Aurora</a>. The team worked together on various missions such as their confrontation with the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> trying to bring <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a> back home and fighting alongside <a href=\"/rom/29-2189/\">Rom</a> to destroy <a href=\"/dire-wraiths/65-14015/\">Dire Wraiths</a>. Sasquatch would battle the Hulk and the <a href=\"/wendigo/29-13313/\">Wendigo.</a></p><p>However Langkowski began to have serious problems keeping his bestial nature in check; nearly losing it once when Aurora flirted with some construction workers and actually losing control while fighting the <a href=\"/super-skrull/29-21332/\">Super Skrull</a> and another time nearly killing Northstar. Langkowski consulted <a href=\"/shaman/29-5017/\">Shaman</a> about the problem but he could find no physical problem with the doctor concluding it must be magical or psychological. For a while,</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1521640\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33044/1521640-snowbird13_super.jpg\" title=\"Breaking his heart\"><img id=\"1521640\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33044/1521640-snowbird13_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Breaking his heart\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Breaking his heart</div></div></div></div><p>Sasquatch was cured of the problem when <a href=\"/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a> created a paradise in the snows, but Langkowski and others rejected the God's gift as the price was too high.</p><p>During a mission to defeat Calibur things came to a head as Snowbird (who was on a mission to destroy the Great Beasts) attacked Sasquatch, the rest of the team moved to intervene but Langkowski was no longer in charge, Tanaraq was in charge. Snowbird explained what Walter had done in the Arctic before taking on a Sasquatch form herself and ripping out Langkowksi's heart. However, Alpha Flight did not give up on Walter as Snowbird had only destroyed his physical form, and Alpha Flight went to the <a href=\"/great-beasts/65-15625/\">Realm of the Great Beasts</a> to rescue his soul. They accomplished their goal, but since Walter's body was destroyed, his soul was forced to inhabit <a href=\"/roger-bochs/29-31581/\">Roger Bochs</a>' <a href=\"/box/29-19987/\">Box</a> armor.</p><h3>Wanda Langkowski</h3><p>Langkowski tolerated being in the Box armour but he wanted out and back into Aurora's arms. Boch and Langkowski searched the inter-dimensional Crossroads for a mindless body and they found the Savage Hulk who trashed the lab leaving the team to think they had lost Langkowski for good. They moved on but for Langkowski he found another body in the form of Smart Alec a villain from Alpha Flight's early days whose mindless body was available. Langkowski took him over and returned to the world via Shaman's medicine pouch, only to find several months had gone by. Before he could digest any of that however the Sorcerer Pestilence, using Snowbird's recently deceased body, crashed into Alpha Flight's HQ in Sasquatch form and a huge battle took place. Langkowski transferred to the Box armor and helped beat down the villain and then as Smart Alec's body had been crushed transferred himself to Snowbirds Sasquatch form.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"406552\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/19940/406552-188980-sasquatch_super.jpg\" title=\"Wanda\"><img id=\"406552\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/19940/406552-188980-sasquatch_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Wanda\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wanda</div></div></div></div><p>Despite being host to a Male soul however when Langkowski transformed back it was into the form of a woman. Taking the name Wanda Langkowski, there was a fight to get him/her legally recognized as alive. Veronica Langkowski claimed Walter's fortune as laid out in his will. A courtroom battle took place and she won partly due to the <a href=\"/dreamqueen/29-44536/\">Dreamqueen</a>'s influence. The Dreamqueen stoked Langkowski's identify crisis and brought him/her under magical influence. Sasquatch was forced to steal <a href=\"/talisman/29-13820/\">Talisman'</a>s coronet of power, but before it could be delivered, Snowbird's mystical form returned Langkowski to a male form breaking the Dreamqueen's spell and giving Langkowski the manhood he wanted.</p><p>Once again orange-brown as Sasquatch instead of white, Langkowski returned to active duty with Alpha Flight. Sasquatch battled <a href=\"/llan/29-24010/\">Llan the Sorcerer</a>, the People's Protectorate, the <a href=\"/combine/29-28673/\">Combine</a>, <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"/atlantis/34-41030/\">Atlantis</a> and fighting with the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, he helped play a part in the cosmic fight during <a href=\"/infinity-crusade/39-42235/\"><i>Infinity Crusade</i></a>. As Langkowski was now definitely a man, he also regained his fortune.</p><h3>Post Alpha Flight</h3><p>Alpha Flight disbanded during a wave of anti-Super/anti-Mutant hysteria in Canada and Walter left for Antarctica to continue his research on gamma radiation at Project Michelangelo. An important project on Gamma Radiation was crashed by <a href=\"/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> which resulted in a near critical meltdown averted only because Sasquatch and Deadpool teamed up to stop it.</p><p>Langkowski came across the nearly dead body of <a href=\"/guardian/29-5047/\">Guardian</a> in the snows of Antarctica. This set in motion a chain of events that led Langowski to gather the members of Alpha Flight outside the revived Official Team. He'd never been invited to join them and they were being mind controlled by hidden figures in Department H. The two teams clashed but eventually the corrupt Department H was brought down. Alpha Flight was reassembled with the core members mostly staying and a new Beta Flight formed.</p><p>Sasquatch would be the only escapee when Alpha Flight was captured by the alien <a href=\"/plodex/65-57619/\">Plodex</a>. Langkowski recruited a new team consisting of <a href=\"/nemesis/29-9367/\">Nemesis</a>, <a href=\"/major-mapleleaf/29-9366/\">Major Mapleleaf</a> II, <a href=\"/zuzha-yu/29-40717/\">Puck II</a>, <a href=\"/yukon-jack/29-9368/\">Yukon Jack</a> and <a href=\"/centennial/29-9369/\">Centennial</a> to take on the alien threat. Except it was not a threat and the core team departed Earth to take the hatched Plodex home. After a time travel/alternate universe adventure, the team continued to protect Canada.</p><h3>The Collective comes</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1521656\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33044/1521656-puck25_super.jpg\" title=\"RIP\"><img id=\"1521656\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33044/1521656-puck25_medium.jpg\" alt=\"RIP\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">RIP</div></div></div></div><p>After <a href=\"/house-of-m/39-40991/\">M Day</a>, a threat arose called <a href=\"/the-collective/29-42938/\">The Collective</a>, a gestalt of the powers lost by mutants the world over absorbed into one Alaskan mutant called <a href=\"/michael-pointer/29-7600/\">Michael Pointer</a>.

This caused the Canadian government to ask Langkowski to form a new team to control them. Since Alpha Flight was gone, the Canadian government didn't have the resources. Working through a Canadian Secret Intelligence Service Agent called Jeff Brown and using <a href=\"/shield/65-3775/\">SHIELD</a> resources, Langkowski formed <a href=\"/omega-flight/65-31159/\">Omega Flight</a> consisting of <a href=\"/usagent/29-14992/\">USAgent</a> and <a href=\"/arachne/29-16197/\">Arachne</a> plus Michael Pointer, who was forced to wear a version of Guardian's suit to control his mutant abilities.</p><p>Sasquatch would battle a powered up <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\">Wrecking Crew</a> who savagely beat him before his team-mates arrived. The Crew took Sasquatch to the Realm of the Great Beasts where their extra power was coming from at the time. This lead to Sasquatch being possessed by Tanaraq again and a Horde of Demons being let loose on Canada. <a href=\"/beta-ray-bill/29-6139/\">Beta Ray Bill</a> and Talisman joined Omega Flight in battle. Beta Ray Bill took Shaman's medicine pouch into the open Portal with Pointer sealing it behind him at his own request.</p><p>Later USAgent would leave and shortly after <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> would tempt Pointer away, marking the end of Omega Flight. However Langkowski continued to battle for Canada and during the <a href=\"/chaos-war/39-56257/\">Chaos War</a> crisis was seen fighting the battle for Canada.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As Sasquatch, Langkowski possesses high super human strength, but just how high depends on the writer. On certain occasions, he has been shown feats of strength rivalling the Hulk (such as lifting a navy destroyer or holding back a DC-10 jet at take off speed!) Therefore, Sasquatch could potentially be ranked among the strongest superheroes in the Marvel Universe. Sasquatch has taken on powerhouses like Hulk, <a href=\"/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut,</a> and <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> - usually inconclusively.</p><p>In addition to strength, he has very high endurance, due to a healing factor. He has sharp claws, his claws are sharp enough to cut through materials such as stone, wood, flesh and even some types of metals. Sasquatch also has superhuman senses, agility and stamina. His Sasquatch form is 10 feet tall and weighs 2000 lbs, while his Human form is still highly athletic and strong due to his football years, though he is past his best. Sasquatch has a thick coat of orange fur that prevents him from danger in the cold weathers of Canada.</p><p>Langkowski is also a brilliant scientist, specializing in radiation. Unlike the Hulk, he retains his intellect in his Sasquatch persona.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-1610 (Ultimate)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"394434\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/394434-62177-sasquatch_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultimate Rahne Sinclair (Earth-1610)\"><img id=\"394434\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5648/394434-62177-sasquatch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate Rahne Sinclair (Earth-1610)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultimate Rahne Sinclair (Earth-1610)</div></div></div></div><p>It was revealed that Sasquatch is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Rahne Sinclair</a>.

They were a wealthy family living in Queens, <a href=\"../../new-york-city/34-41183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York</a>. Her father was a \u201ctravel salesman\u201d and would go away on many business trips, leaving her mother to raise Felicia mainly by herself. However, her father would constantly encourage her to be the best at what she does. However, her mother was not satisfied with \u201cher best\u201d and always pushed Felicia to win first place. Felicia would find interest in extracurricular activities such as cheer leading and gymnastics. When Felicia was thirteen years old, one day during cheer leading practice her mother informs her that her father had died in a plane crash over the Andes Mountains in South America. However, Felicia would eventually discover that her father was an infamous cat burglar in the newspapers, which allowed her to piece together the reason for her father\u2019s \u201cbusiness trips.\u201d One day, when Felicia was mugged, she learned of the excitement that comes in her father\u2019s career. She decides to learn self defense and enrolls in a martial arts class. There, she is trained by Miyagi Kanryo in the art of Okinawa Goju Ryu. Felicia also takes the time to learn how to pick locks and crack open safes.</p><p>As a freshman at <a href=\"../../empire-state-university/34-43783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Empire State University</a>, she was date raped by her boyfriend, Ryan. Horrified and angered that he had stolen her life, and even though she knew the consequences, she decided that she was going to murder him. Felicia decided to set her studies aside and underwent rigorous trainings, learning other different styles of fighting and after several months, was ready. She set out to find him, but he died in a car crash while he was drunk. She was angry that she could not fulfill her desire to kill him, so she decided to follow her father's footsteps. Felicia then decided to make a costume and steals many valuable items. Felicia then decided to don the \u201cBlack Cat\u201d identity because of a few reasons, cats have nine lives and land on their feet, crossing a black cat is bad luck, she is a cat burglar, she has a pet black cat named Onyx, and her father was the Black Cat.</p><h2>Creation</h2><table class=\"t-editor with-out-border natural-width\"><tbody><tr><td>Originally, the Black Cat was never intended to be a character in Spider-Man, nor a cat burglar. <a href=\"../../marv-wolfman/26-41478/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marv Wolfman</a> was writing <a href=\"../../spider-woman/29-1453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Woman</a> and was planning to create a female villain for Spider-Woman.

Now working on <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a> and after a cover rejection for Amazing Spider-Man #194, he would finally introduce Black Cat on July 1979.

She decided to break her father out of prison, but with careful planning at first. She breaks into the police station in order to gain information on criminals that will work for hire. Felicia would quickly cross paths with Spider-Man and she is forced to fend him off, succeeding and escaped from Spider-Man. As she was breaking her father out of prison she crosses paths with Spider-Man again, however Felicia was prepared this time. Even though Felicia had a hatred towards men since her date rape incident, she felt she had a special bond with Spider-Man. She had set up a trap near Spider-Man, which caused an explosion allowing Felicia and her father to escape. This was one of many tricks Felicia would use to force opponents to believe that she emits bad luck. She takes her father home to her mother and revealed that the Black Cat was his own daughter. Her father attempts to persuade her not to make the same mistake as he did and follow him down a dark path. Felicia ignores it and leaves him and her mother alone. Meanwhile, Spider-Man discovers that Felicia Hardy is the Black Cat when he goes through Walter Hardy\u2019s profile. Spider-Man would meet up with the Black Cat outside her home. The two begin fighting as Felicia does not want to end up in jail. Their battle ensues across the rooftops until they both slip off. However, Spider-Man was able to grab on to the ledge and hold on to Felicia. However, she slips and falls to what appeared to Spider-Man, to be her death. Felicia had become depressed after nearly dying, her father\u2019s death, and that she believed no one would recognize her skills except Spider-Man. Felicia continued her criminal career and became one of the most notorious Cat Burglars in the city. However, her real plan was to force Spider-Man to come after her. Spider-Man had placed a <a href=\"../../spider-tracer/18-55656/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Tracer</a> on her that she could not remove.</p><p>Knowing that she could never lose him with the tracer on her, she decided to lure him to a room that showed her obsession of Spider-Man with clippings of newspaper pictures of him covering the entire wall. Spider-Man decided to take Felicia to the Mitchell State Hospital and checked her in for a six month stay. Since Felicia was not really insane and was only pretending in order to avoid jail time for her crimes, she easily breaks out of the institution and continues her career as a cat burglar. Felicia moves into an apartment of her own and hides under a new alias, Felicia Harmon. She would also disguise herself with a curly black wig. Felicia went straight to work and stole an original Ehrenreich painting easily. However, she would quickly discover that she was beginning to become bored with her current lifestyle as she gained no fame and always hid in the shadows. She begins thinking about Spider-Man again and realizes how much she misses the excitement of being around him. Felicia decides to hire a sky writer and had him write a message in the sky to gain Spider-Man\u2019s attention. The message told Spider-Man to meet her at their \u201cfirst date,\u201d to which he receives and heads straight for the place. The Black Cat begins to flirt with Spider-Man and explains to him that she wants to quit her criminal career and help him fight crime. She continues to explain the reason for breaking her father out of jail and tries to rationalize that the people she stole from were the ones who stole the item first, or that they have enough money to buy a new one.</p><p>She then confesses that she would do anything just so the two of them could have a relationship together. Afterwards, she leaves him along with the painting that she stole with a note, saying that if he accepts her offer to meet her at the costume party the next night. When Spider-Man arrives to meet up with Black Cat, she reveals to him that meeting her there was so she could prove that she could aid him in fighting crime. Spider-Man and the Black Cat was forced to fight a massive amount of the criminal underworld. However, Spider-Man and Black Cat would come out on top, and Spider-Man began to believe that she was serious in becoming good. Later, Felicia decides to steal a statue from a show room despite Spider-Man\u2019s disapproval.</p><p>The owner discovers who the two really are and forced Spider-Man and Black Cat to fight. Spider-Man was shot in the leg, but he was able to beat the enemies up. Felicia had made her getaway during the crossfire, but <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a> chased her down to the docks, where he webs her entire body. She tells Spider-Man that she\u2019d rather die then go to jail and forces herself into the water. Spider-Man was still wounded and was unable to locate her whereabouts. Just afterwards, <a href=\"../../jean-dewolff/29-2471/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain DeWolff</a> came to give her amnesty for her past crimes, but was too late.</p><h3>Black Cat's Relationship With Spider-Man</h3><p>After an extended disappearance, Felicia had learned that <a href=\"../../kingpin/29-1483/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kingpin</a> had a nuclear detonator that he was going to auction off. The <a href=\"../../owl/29-13908/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Owl</a> planned to use it against <a href=\"../../new-york-city/34-41183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York</a> to hold the city hostage while <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus</a> had planned to detonate the whole city with it. Felicia decided to steal the detonator and she gave the detonator to Spider-Man, and instantly became one of Octopus' enemies. Spider-Man tore off his mechanical arms though was still able to control them mentally and had held Hardy down while his men opened fire on her. Spider-Man had gotten Felicia to the hospital in time when they started operating on her multiple bullet and knife wounds. He quickly realized just how much he really cared for her. After Felicia recovered from her injuries, they soon began a relationship. Spider-Man decides to reveal his true identity to Felicia and brought her to his apartment. However, Felicia had a hard time accepting, as she could not understand why he wanted to live a civilian when he could use his Spider-Man alter-ego to become rich and famous. Spider-Man became hurt that she only loved Spider-Man and not <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker</a>. However, Spider-Man rationalizes it that since his previous relationships ended because he had to keep his identity from them, but with Felicia, she loved his alter-ego.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1926412\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1926412-1788539_13032481513_super.jpg\" title=\"Black Cat and Spider-Man\"><img id=\"1926412\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/95681/1926412-1788539_13032481513_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Black Cat and Spider-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Black Cat and Spider-Man</div></div></div></div><p>Their attentions were quickly drawn to muggers harassing an innocent person. Spider-Man tells her to wait there, but she decides to tag along anyways. The two of them easily defeat the muggers, however Felicia shows signs of fatigue due to just recently being released from the hospital. While Spider-Man was battling against <a href=\"../../mr-hyde/29-3233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Hyde</a>, she decided to join the battle in hopes of proving to Spider-Man that she could take care of herself in battle. However, Spider-Man continued to shout orders at her, and despite her knowing his good intentions, became angered that he was giving her orders and continued to try and protect her. Black Cat decides to try and engage against Mr. Hyde herself, to which she realizes that she was overwhelmed by his strength. Spider-Man intertwined to try and help, but was punched through the roof. Felicia had believed that Spider-Man was killed on that punch. <a href=\"../../cobra/29-11895/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cobra</a> arrives and battles Mr. Hyde, where Black Cat sees an opening and trips him off his feet. After a near death experience, Felicia feared that the lack of powers (her \u201cbad luck\u201d was due to carefully planned traps set by Felicia herself to make her opponents believe she emits \u201cbad luck\u201d) would make her a liability for Spider-Man and was terrified that Spider-Man would be devastated if she were to die. During the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/39-40978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Wars</a>, when Spider-Man had left, Felicia seeks a way to gain superpowers to aid Spider-Man in battle. She first tried <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tony Stark</a>, only to discover he was missing. She then tried <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hank Pym</a>, who did not return any of her calls. She then went to the <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a> and the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/65-3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> for help and was rejected.</p><p>Felicia would seek out a mysterious person who agreed to help her gain superpowers by using Dr. Farley Stillwell\u2019s latent gene technique, similar to the <a>Scorpion</a> and the <a>Fly</a>. Felicia gained a latent mutant ability that allows her to emit bad luck to those around her. Felicia would soon learn that the mystery person was really the Kingpin, and Felicia was not pleased to hear the news. She had new powers, but was ashamed to tell Spider-Man. Angered that she had fallen into a trap by the Kingpin, and feared that he may call upon her for errands, and also fearing how Spider-Man would react if she told him. Felicia decides that it was best of she did not tell Spider-Man at all. She also thought up of an excuse if he asked her how she gained her new powers, she would just tell him that they were latent and she had them for a long time. She also decides that if the Kingpin orders her to do something, she just would not do it. She continued to search for Spider-Man, and while searching for Spider-Man in the <a href=\"../../avengers-mansion/34-41036/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers Mansion</a>, <a href=\"../../vision/29-1504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vision</a> offered her a membership to join the Avengers, but she turned it down. When Spider-Man finally returned from the Secret Wars with his new <a href=\"../../symbiotes/65-56880/\" rel=\"nofollow\">symbiote</a> costume, her new probability manipulation power were starting to affect Spider-Man already, which is exactly what the Kingpin wanted.</p><h3>The Break Up</h3><p>Eventually Spider-Man would discover her powers and confronts her about them. Felicia decides to just tell Spider-Man exactly how, why, and who she gained the powers from. She then reveals that she gained the powers from the Kingpin which stunned Spider-Man. She tries to rationalize with him that the reason she did it was so she could continue sharing their adventures together. Spider-Man then begins to lecture her about going to the Kingpin for power, then all of a sudden the roof that they were standing on collapsed. Spider-Man realizes that the accidents he had been having were caused by Felicia\u2019s latent ability. The two agreed to meet up with the Kingpin on the next night. The next night, Spider-Man arrives at Felicia\u2019s apartment, where she gives him a cloth version of the black costume ( Spider-Man had just gotten rid of the black suit because he discovered it was a symbiote).</p><p>Spider-Man turned down her gift, and the two headed for the Kingpin's building. However, the two were encountered by the <a href=\"../../spot/29-18270/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spot</a> atop of Kingpin's building. The Spot was successful in fending off Spider-Man and the Black Cat, so the two of them decided to regroup and try again later. However, Black Cat decides to go to Kingpin\u2019s place by herself. Once she arrived, she discovered that Spider-Man had thought of the same idea. However, she decided to let him deal with the Spot alone while she headed straight for the Kingpin. Felicia finally confronted the Kingpin who revealed his plans to her. He tells her that he had wanted to get revenge on her and Spider-Man for stealing the detonator and letting it fall into <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Octopus</a>\u2019 hands, which forced the Kingpin to leave \u201chis\u201d city. Felicia then asks how giving her powers would help him gain his revenge, to which he explains that her powers cause bad luck to anyone around her. And the longer a person like Spider-Man stays around her, they would eventually die. Horrified at the news, she runs out of the building as Spider-Man enters to fight the Kingpin. Felicia decided to think by herself, and eventually concluded that she had to break up with Spider-Man in order to keep him out of harms way. Just as she was about to break up with Spider-Man, he tells her that they are too different for each other, and that he could not handle the fact that she loved Spider-Man more then Peter Parker. Spider-Man then breaks up with Felicia. She was in shock and was angered that he was the one who broke up with her. Spider-Man realized something was wrong, and with the help of <a href=\"../../doctor-strange/29-1456/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Strange</a> he was able to take the hex off Spider-Man.</p><p>However, this also altered the hex's source and altered Felicia\u2019s powers, making her new addition of powers super strength, agility, balance, super vision, and claws, all much like a cat. Felicia thought this was a reinvention of her, so she rekindled her relationship with Parker and stood by Spider-Man as he was accused of murder. They tracked down this elaborate scheme and fought a mercenary called <a href=\"../../foreigner/29-13381/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Foreigner</a>. Parker thought his life was falling apart when he came to discover that Felicia was in fact causing this. He also discovered that Felicia had never forgiven him for their break up and had started a relationship with Foreigner to gain revenge against Spider-Man. However, Felicia would eventually realize her true feelings for Peter and double crossed the Foreigner. Felicia decides to leave the country and went to <a href=\"../../europe/34-56099/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Europe</a> to start a new life. This forced Peter to find a new relationship with <a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Jane</a> Watson. Years later, Hardy returned to America and learned from <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom</a> that Peter had gone on to marry Mary Jane, and started physically threatening her. She also started going out with <a href=\"../../flash-thompson/29-1489/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flash Thompson</a> to spite Peter.</p><p>They had cared for each other, but he broke up with Felicia as soon as he discovered her secret and Felicia became a better person by making amends with Peter and becoming friends with Mary Jane. Spider-Man was later exposed to a device which removed all his powers by the <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon</a>, Felicia had helped in finding the device and after battling the Scorpion and the <a href=\"../../tarantula/29-1528/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarantula</a> (Luis Alvarez), was successful in restoring his powers, however she had lost her own powers in the process. In order to regain her abilities, Felicia purchased equipment from the <a href=\"../../tinkerer/29-3144/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tinkerer</a> to help incorporate her abilities into her costume and occasionally teams up with Spider-Man. During <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage</a>, Felicia aided Spider-Man and Venom in their battle against <a href=\"../../carnage/29-1490/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnage</a>. Felicia briefly accepted Venom\u2019s beliefs that they had to kill Carnage to stop him. However, she decides to go down the same road as Spider-Man and helped him stop Carnage without murdering him.</p><h3>New Life</h3><p>Felicia later creates her own private investigations business called Cat\u2019s Eye Private Investigations. The P.I. office specializes in body guarding, background checks, bounty hunting, and installing burglarproof security systems. She is also residing in <a href=\"../../los-angeles/34-56019/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Los Angeles</a>, <a href=\"../../california/34-55716/\" rel=\"nofollow\">California</a>. Felicia gets a call from her friend Meg who was panicking that her friend Tracia had not checked in for a while. Felicia agrees to return to <a href=\"../../new-york-city/34-41183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York</a> to investigate her disappearance and was also hoping to see Spider-Man again. It has been five years since the two of them were in a romantic relationship, and Felicia was torturing herself over the fact that she was too spoiled back then, and it cost her a relationship with Spider-Man. She found a link between Tracia and a movie star named Hunter Todd, so she decided to head over to the Soho Grand Hotel where he was staying at. While there, Felicia sees a person creeping around the window and she decides to attack it. It turns out to be Spider-Man.</p><p>After the two recover, Felicia asks for Tracia Lane while Spider-Man asks for a teenage boy who died named Donald Phillips. Todd\u2019s reaction assured the two that he knew the answers. Suddenly, Todd begins to overdose on Heroine, and the same happens to the woman he was with. Someone begins talking through the phone, to which Spider-Man answers. It was <a href=\"../../garrison-klum/29-11542/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Brownstone</a>, and he tells him that he is giving them an overdose and hangs up. The two of them argue for a bit on the rooftop, then they decide to go patrol the city until they see smoke from a building. They engage against the villain and defeats her easily. Afterwards they were thanked by <a href=\"../../garrison-klum/29-11542/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garrison Klum</a>, and Spider-Man believes that man is Mr. Brownstone. Felicia and Spider-Man decides to ask the girl they just arrested who hired her to kill the guy, she eventually gives in when Spider-Man annoyed her too much. When they arrived to the house of the person who hired the hit, they discovered him and his wife chopped to bits, but the baby was allowed to live. Both of them decided to scare Mr. Brownstone, but that was all Spider-Man had planned. He said there was not enough evidence to catch him, and it angered Felicia. They get into a heated argument and then a fight. Felicia was able to web Spider-Man to the floor and she went after Brownstone herself.</p><p>Felicia sneaks into Brownstone\u2019s place and tries to kill him, but he was not in his bed. He was behind her, but he didn\u2019t pose a threat. He distracted Black Cat by talking to her while he heated up some Heroine. After he was done, he teleported the Heroine into Felicia causing her to overdose on Heroine. Felicia was now helpless and in Brownstone\u2019s hands. Brownstone was attempting to rape her. However, Brownstone was killed before he could rape her and Felicia is charged with murdering Brownstone. Meanwhile, Spider-Man teams up with <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> to break Felicia out of jail. When they arrive, they discovered <a href=\"../../mysterio/29-4333/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Francis Klum</a> ( Garrison\u2019s brother) holding Felicia, he makes Daredevil and Spider-Man fight each other and teleports out of <a href=\"../../rykers-island/34-55830/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ryker</a>\u2019s. It is revealed that Francis was the one who killed Garrison, and while he was teleporting Felicia, he told her about the times his brother sexually harassed him. He tells her that he saved her because he was sick of what Garrison was doing. Felicia wanted to get help for Francis, but he is scared that he will get the death penalty. However, she assures him that he is not to worry because he is sick. She tells Francis about the time she was raped, and what she went through afterwards.</p><p>Spider-Man and Daredevil arrive to the bridge that they were talking at, and sees flashes of <a href=\"../../gwen-stacy/29-1480/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gwen</a> and tries to prevent the same from happening to Felicia. Spider-Man was hurt when Francis teleported Felicia\u2019s mask into his neck, then picks up a gun and points it at Felicia for betraying him. Spider-Man webs the gun, but he falls off the bridge and Spider-Man could not catch him, but Francis teleports mid-air and disappears. The next day, Peter and Felicia takes a walk in the park and she was ready to tell him what had happened to her during college. Felicia would later team up with Spider-Man and <a href=\"../../puma/29-15238/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puma</a> to battle against <a href=\"../../stegron/29-7776/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stegron</a>. Stegron was planning to devolve the entire population of New York City. Eventually the three of them would be successful in defeating Stegron. Shortly after, Puma and Black Cat began a romantic relationship. While they were in bed together, it was noticeable that Felicia may have some feelings for Peter still. When Peter revealed to the world that he was Spider-Man, it greatly disappointed Felicia because she believed that they shared a \"sexy\" bond as she was one of the few who knew his true identity.</p><h3>Civil War / The Initiative:</h3><p>In the <a href=\"../../civil-war/49-18023/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civil War</a>, Felicia joins <a href=\"../../heroes-for-hire/65-23588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heroes For Hire</a> but joins purely for money, apprehending any unregistered heroes and bounties.

Her father eventually died in prison and Felicia blamed the Kingpin for the death of her father and vowed to take revenge. Fifteen years after her father died, Felicia became an accountant for the company Fisk Enterprise and spent her nights stealing from Manhattan's more prominent office buildings, under the disguise of the Black Cat. When a man named Mr. Moore offered to buy his way into the Kingpin's organization with an inscribed stone tablet that the Kingpin desired, Felicia broke into his apartment and stole the tablet from his office safe. While escaping with the tablet, she encountered Spider-Man but used her bad luck powers to evade him. Video footage was captured of the two of them together and the police suspected that they were partners in crime. Intrigued by this accusation, Felicia decided to place an advertisement in the Daily Bugle newspaper, asking Spider-Man to meet her on the rooftop near the site of their confrontation. Spider-Man met her there and she flirted with in and brought him cheese and wine. However, their reunion was interrupted by Elektra, who was hired to retrieve to tablet. Felicia and Elektra battled, until Spider-Man intervened and both Felicia and Electra escaped. Spider-Man remembered the comments that Felicia said to Elektra about telling the Kingpin she was not her father, so decided to search the Daily Bugle records to find out her identity. He realized that if he could find these documents, so could the Kingpin so he raced to Felicia's apartment to find her already in the hands of Kingpin. Spider-Man's arrival gave Felicia a opening to break free and she fled to the roof of her apartment. The Kingpin and the assassin Elektra pursued her but just as they were about to reach Felicia, she threw the tablet in the harbor. Angry, Elektra threw her sai into Felicia's chest and she fell from the roof into the sea, apparently dead.</p><p>Felicia returned several months later to help aid Spider-Man during the war between Kingpin's forces and the Hammerhead.

She attends <a href=\"../../empire-state-university/34-43783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Empire State University</a> with Peter Parker, Peter is also Felicia's science tutor. Peter would try multiple times, to go on a date with Felicia, but she would constantly turn him down. Felicia had been saved by Spider-Man a few times before. Her mother, Anastasia Hardy, was a normal business woman and mother. Her father on the other hand, John Hardesky, was a well known jewel thief called \"The Cat.\" When her father was a young boy, he memorized the Super Soldier Serum during World War II. Two notable relationships that Felicia went through was <a href=\"../../morbius/29-6722/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michael Morbius</a>, who turned into a vampire, and <a href=\"../../hobgoblin/29-7605/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jason Macendale</a>, who was revealed to be the <a href=\"../../hobgoblin/29-7605/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hobgoblin</a>.</p><p>The Black Cat would finally make her first appearance in season 4, which was entitled Partners in Crime. Felicia had discovered that her father, John Hardesky, was the infamous burglar called The Cat and that he was being held prisoner on the SHIELD Helicarrier. This was because he had memorized the Super Soldier Formula, and that knowledge makes it too dangerous for him to be out in the public. Eventually the Kingpin would get his hands on Hardesky and force him to give up the Super Soldier Formula. To make sure Hardesky gave him the proper formula, they tested it on Felicia. She gained enhanced strength, speed, and stamina. Felicia was also able to alter her appearance, giving her white hair instead of her natural blond in the series. Eventually Spider-Man would arrive and they defeat the Kingpin. Afterwards, Hardesky says his farewells to his wife and daughter before he turns himself over to SHIELD, due to his knowledge on the Super Soldier Formula.</p><p>Most of season 4 is Black Cat teaming with Spider-Man to fight crime.</p><p>She continues to flirt with Spider-Man, who also plays along (<a href=\"../../mary-jane/29-13380/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mary Jane</a> fell into the dimension portal at the end of season 3). However, Felicia would reunite with Morbius, who was still in his vampire form. Morbius, Felicia, Spider-Man, and <a href=\"../../blade/29-7570/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blade</a> would battle against Blade's mother. Afterwards, Felicia would agree to go with Morbius, as she still has feelings for him. Black Cat would finally reappear in season 5's Secret Wars. She was angered at Spider-Man for taking her as she was in the middle of fighting with Morbius and Blade. Eventually she agrees to help him out, and after the Secret Wars was over, she was returned.</p><p><b><u>Spectacular Spider-Man</u></b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2057097\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71700/2057097-black_cat.jpg\" title=\"Black Cat in Spectacular Spider-Man\"><img id=\"2057097\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71700/2057097-black_cat_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Black Cat in Spectacular Spider-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Black Cat in Spectacular Spider-Man</div></div></div></div><p>Black Cat first appears as a cameo in the episode \"The Uncertainty Principle\" in her costume during Halloween. In the episode \"Persona\", Spider-Man catches Felicia trying to steal the Symbiote. After some flirting and quite rhythmic sparring, Black Cat gets away. Spider-Man knows that she doesn't have the Symbiote, but is unaware that it has began bonding to his own suit. Later, Chameleon, with the help of Mysterio and Phineas Mason, begins framing Spider-Man for crimes he did not commit. Eventually, Spider-Man seeks the aid of Black Cat. She helps him to infiltrate a boat-side robbery and stop Chameleon. At the end of the episode, Felicia kisses Spider-Man, hiding a necklace that she stole, behind his back. In season two, Black Cat returns for two episodes. In the episode \"Accomplices\", she tries to steal the formula for the Rhino, but before she could, Hammerhead, Silver Sable, and other gang mobs appeared, as they were auctioning the formula off. Knowing the situation, she quietly walked away. In the episode \"Opening Night\", She tries to break out her Father, Walter Harvey, in prison. Little did she know, Spider-man was also there due to testing out the new prison security. It is later revealed that Walter was the burglar who shot Uncle Ben. He decides to stay in prison to pay his debt. Thinking that this was because of Spider-Man's influence she angrily says she will never forgive him before leaving. In this series, she is voiced by Tricia Helfer.</p><h3>Movies</h3><p>Felicia Hardy was intended to be added to the <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/spider-man-2/16-25346/\"><i>Spider-man 2</i></a> (2004) film as a complexity to the relationship of Mary Jane and Peter, but this idea was eventually rejected due to the risk of over complicating the plot with new characters.

On more than one occasion Spider-man must engage multiple clones of Black Cat.</p></li></ul>", "deck": "Former cat burglar Felicia Hardy became a crime fighter when she became romantically involved with Spider-Man.

With the appearance of Spider-Man doing good deeds in London, Gwen's Uncle Arthur convinces Gwen that Spider-Man could not have been responsible for his brother's death. He also tells her that she was expecting too much out of Peter since they were still so young.

However, she understands eventually in the film that Peter was never out for the way she would've wanted him to be, and instead apologizes to Mary Jane for her actions. However, Gwen Stacy is saved by Spiderman in a crane accident, whom she portrays to have some vague feelings for, and even kisses him in front of an audience. She is last seen at Harry Osbourn's funeral, a thumbs up for mythos fans that the potential romance of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy coul may as well, come true.</p><p>As the movies have strayed far off course with the sense of mythos-canon on and, the character of Gwen Stacy is not the first love of main character Peter Parker/Spiderman. Instead, she is portrayed as the potential love interest, one that has not been classified as Peter's first as she usually is in comic-canon.</p><h4>The Amazing Spider-Man</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2486586\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/12/128880/2486586-emma_stone_gwen_stacy.jpg\" title=\"Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy\"><img id=\"2486586\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/12/128880/2486586-emma_stone_gwen_stacy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy</div></div></div></div><p>The movie franchise will see a reboot, and Gwen Stacy will appear as the first love of Peter Parker in his mythos.

Gwen is not the comic-canon buxom blond of the series as she is quite frequently portrayed as, but instead, she is a more strong willed, and kind person, harboring deep feelings for her best friend Peter. She also wears glasses, something very different from other incarnations. The show starts with the beginning of Junior Year in high school for Gwen, Stacy, and Harry. There they meet the harsh jocks, including Flash Thompson, annoying cheerleaders, and more so, opportunities all three know are out to get them. Early on, Peter and Gwen both are recommended by their science teachers to go and attend an internship at famous scientist Curt Connors office, ironically the exact place where Peter's good friend and mentor Eddie Brock also holds an internish at. Gwen, Edie, and peter spend many nights working alongside the doctor, but Peter is eventually kicked off the team due to his frequent disappearances and somewhat carelessness towards his Peter Parker duties whilst being Spiderman. Throughout the whole first season, Gwen is shwn to be very fond of Peter, however, often criticizes him about his duties, responsibilites, and frequent 'no-tells.' The first season ends with Gwen kissing Peter on the lips on Thanksgiving night, leaving him surprised.</p><p>The second season starts off with Peter ignoring Gwen about their first kiss. The season continues with Peter attempting to choose between cheerleader Liz Allan and his best friend Gwen. Eventually, Peter picks Liz over Gwen, and gwen goes out with harry. Canon slightly makes it's way into the show when Gwen is kidnapped by Venom, and held up high over fifty feet high, paying homage to the Bridge scene from the comics. Spiderman goes after her, sucessfully saving her, and still being able to keep his secret safe. At the end of season two, Spiderman breaks up with Liz Allan, comes to his senses, and takes baby steps to pursue a relationship with Gwen. However, Gwen is still with Harry, and continues to stay with him out of guilt because of Norman Osbourne's so called death. Gwen is still harbouring feelings for Peter, but cannot be with him because of Harry's issues. Season 3 is rumored to be set in a love triangle between Peter, Gwen, and Harry, Harry's struggle with his father's death, Gwen's feelings for Peter getting more serious, Peter realizing his feelings for Gwen are getting more serious, and the introduction to the characters of Hobgoblin and Scorpion.</p>", "deck": "Gwen Stacy is the first true love of Peter Parker.

Fisk quickly became nothing more than a mere target for bullies and pity because of his pathetic status. Fisk would live his young life in reclusive who was forced into witnessing the normal lives of others, because of this Fisk would develop a unique perspective by using others to meet his own needs. This was the very first step towards Fisk\u2019s criminal career that followed him throughout his entire life. Dedicated to be the best there was, Fisk would find himself committing his first murder at the age twelve and strongly believed that brute strength was the only way to become successful within the criminal underworld. Instantly Fisk trained himself in body-building and sumo to build his body and strength that eventually turned the young Fisk into a massive force of brute strength for his young age. Fisk would also build his education by learning from various stolen books and taking a strong interest within Political Science. With the combined strength and knowledge, Fisk quickly became a dominating force over the local gangs who intimidated other unwilling children and bullies into joining his gang. Displaying uncanny leadership abilities and organization skills has found itself earning Fisk the nickname known as \u201cKingpin of Crime\u201d, a title that he gained as a teenager.</p><p>Fisk\u2019s brutal and successful reputation would finally catch the attention of other well-known crime bosses within New York City. After finding himself impressed with Fisk\u2019s gained reputation, crime boss <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dante-rigoletto/29-15648/\">Don Rigoletto</a> recruited Fisk to serve as his personal right-hand man. But Fisk\u2019s dedication to be the best eventually found Fisk killing Rigoletto and taking over his gang as his own. Fisk now became the most feared and successful crime lords within New York City.</p><p>Successfully building his gang into an army, Fisk carefully planned and plotted his goals behind scenes and further away from the laws reach. As Fisk\u2019s reputation began to grow with wealth, influence, and power, so did the competition with other well-known gangs, mostly the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maggia/65-26082/\">Maggia</a>. Later Fisk decided to hide his criminal campaign by investing his wealth as a legitimate businessman after investing in spice from the far east. With crime slowly building up within the streets, nobody would ever suspect that the humbled spice dealer was the actual leader of the events and that the business helped Fisk increase his wealth to take down other competitive gangs. It would be during this time where Fisk met the young <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vanessa-fisk/29-10058/\">Vanessa</a> and both Fisk and Vanessa would instantly fall in love and later be married. Fisk would be emotionally moved by Vanessa to where he was finally at peace from his struggle for power. A year later Vanessa would give birth to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/richard-fisk/29-14570/\">Richard Fisk</a>, who desperately tried to hide the child from his father\u2019s criminal activities. With Richard growing up in a life where his father constantly despised him because of how he saw him weak and pathetic, Vanessa would send Richard to Europe to attend schooling and further avoid him from her husband\u2019s abusiveness and criminal lifestyle. It would be after Richard graduated from school where he remained in Europe and faked his death in an attempt to cease his connections with his family. After receiving news of his son\u2019s death, even though Fisk suspected foul play, he still hid the news from his wife.</p><p>As a businessman, Fisk found himself in competition with one his own partner who was a Cheyenne known as Willie Lincoln A.K.A. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crazy-horse/29-14956/\">Crazy Horse</a>. Killing the man in order to advance in his position, Fisk would adopt Crazy Horse\u2019s daughter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/echo/29-9038/\">Maya Lopez</a> as his own child after recognizing her display of photographic reflexes. Fisk would later find himself sending Maya to a special school where she would spend great portion of her life under Fisk\u2019s distant supervision. As Fisk\u2019s influence began to rise, so did the costume heroes that would later be a threat for Fisk\u2019s reputation. Almost encountering <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-man</a> after hiring a mutant girl to sabotage a construction side, Fisk would see an opportunity with the rising heroes. Recognizing how careless their battles with villains are when destroying valuable property and possessions, alongside with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/anne-marie-hoag/29-43305/\">Anne-Marie Hoag</a>, all three would form the government operated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/damage-control/65-4951/\">Damage Control</a>. Stark would later sell his share of the company after feeling uneasy with partnering with Fisk after learning his secret reputation. Later Fisk would drop out from Damage Control and take his share with him, leaving Anne-Marie as the sole founder.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Kingpin would make his first debut in July 1967 Amazing Spider-man #50. With Spider-man battling various crime bosses such as Big Man, Crime-Master, and even the Green Goblin himself, Stan Lee wanted a character who would treat crime as if it was nothing more than a mere business. Wanting a villain who would successfully unite crime into a massive army under his command and be the boss of all other crime bosses, both Stan Lee and artist John Romita would gain their idea from the movie actor known as Sydney Greenstreet and create Wilson Fisk, also known as the King of Crime.</p><p>In Amazing Spider-man #70, Stan Lee decided to add more to Wilson Fisk's character by \u201chumanizing\u201d him. Revealed to be a married man, Fisk would show readers that aside from his life of crime, he would be a devoted husband who cared for his family as much as he cared for his title as the Kingpin of Crime.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-age/49-23352/\">Silver Age</a></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1191879\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5586/1191879-kp1_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1191879\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5586/1191879-kp1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>When making his first debut within the Marvel Universe, Kingpin became a unique and major threat for Spider-man on several occasions. Seen as a massive overweight man who displayed himself as a business man, Kingpin would successfully unite all crime within New York City. Sometimes foiled by Spider-man, both Kingpin and Spider-man would gain numerous victories over each other several times that ended with Spider-man successfully foiling Kingpin's plans to take over New York City. His hatred for the meddling wall-crawler would develop to where Kingpin would focus on gaining his revenge against Spider-man and become much more of a threat to Spider-man. At the end of the Silver Age, it would be discovered that Fisk was a married man to an unknown woman.</p><p>Originally Fisk would be seen as a basic criminal mastermind taking a direct role in his schemes, later Kingpin would become more of a corrupted businessman who secretly operated behind his desk.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bronze-age/12-55978/\">The Bronze Age</a></h3><p>The Bronze Age became a major highlight within Kingpins character as his wife Vanessa and his son Richard Fisk are introduced. Displayed as a dysfunctional family because of their struggles with Kingpin's criminal lifestyle, Kingpin would also find himself battling Captain America when he managed to become the Supreme HYDRA in Las Vegas. After both Kingpin and his son faced near-death experiences, Vanessa vowed to leave Kingpin if he chose not give up his career as the Kingpin of Crime. Giving her husband twenty-four remaining hours as the Kingpin, Fisk almost killed Spider-man if not for his wife\u2019s time limit.</p><p>Supposedly retired, Fisk would be forced into his role as the Kingpin when his wife was kidnapped by local crime-lords in retaliation to Fisk giving valuable evidence that could send them to jail. Believing his wife died in an accident, the events managed to capture Daredevil's attention where both Kingpin and Daredevil would fight for the first time in their long and enduring battle with each other. Reunited with his found wife, Fisk would see Daredevil as a major threat to his position when the hero successfully began to foil his plans of ruling New York City. As Kingpin continued becoming a major threat for Spider-man and Daredevil, the Punisher would later make his attempt against the Kingpin, which normally ended with the vigilante\u2019s defeat.</p><h3>The Modern Age</h3><p>The Modern Age would be one of the most darkest chapters in Daredevil\u2019s career because of the Kingpin. After obtaining information that proved Daredevil was Matt Murdock, Kingpin would ruin the life of one his most formidable enemies and make an example of him. However, Fisk's attacks backfired when the struggling hero exposed Fisk's criminal lifestyle to the public and later lost his fortune because of a competitive terrorist organization that was dedicated to see Fisk's downfall. Eventually Fisk rebuilt his criminal empire only to find himself nearly dying from several attacks and assassinations that was even orchestrated by his own son. Still hounding Daredevil with his obtained knowledge, Fisk would eventually be arrested for a murder he committed years ago.</p><p>Even behind bars Fisk proved to be more of a threat when manipulating Daredevil, the FBI, and even Iron Man into doing his bidding. It would take his dying wife Vanessa to convince Daredevil to set her husband free. Doing so, Daredevil managed to fulfill Vanessa\u2019s dying wish and released her husband from captivity only if he revoked his citizenship and left the United States.</p><p>Briefly retiring, Fisk would be forced into returning to the US when Lady Bullseye and the Hand attacked him. Telling Daredevil that his fight with the Hand would be his last, secretly Fisk decided to take over the Hand and rebuild his lost criminal empire. Unsuccessful because of Daredevil acceptance of the offer to become the leader of the Hand and opportunity to change the organization from within, Fisk would wait for the right moment to strike at Daredevil and take over the Hand for himself.</p><p>After seeing Daredevil\u2019s display of vigilantism, Fisk took great pride as to how the events would possibly turn for the better for him. As predicted, Daredevil would find himself forced into fighting his fellow friends and other urban level heroes. Knowing that the Hand influenced and slowly possessed Daredevil, Fisk responded to this by reviving Ghost Rider to do his bidding, which was to take down Daredevil and his army. Managing to do so, Fisk finally took what remained of Daredevil\u2019s army and accomplished his first step on to becoming the Kingpin of Crime once more.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>In the Clutches of the Kingpin</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"75872\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75872-146564-kingpin_super.jpg\" title=\"With Spider-man retired, Kingpin instantly grabbed the opportunity of uniting all crime under his control and having New York City fall into his hands.\"><img id=\"75872\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75872-146564-kingpin_medium.jpg\" alt=\"With Spider-man retired, Kingpin instantly grabbed the opportunity of uniting all crime under his control and having New York City fall into his hands.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">With Spider-man retired, Kingpin instantly grabbed the opportunity of uniting all crime under his control and having New York City fall into his hands.</div></div></div></div><p>Aside from Tony Stark and possibly Anne-Marie Hoag, the public would see Fisk as a wealthy and legitimate businessman who occasionally donated to charities and was viewed as a generous man. After witnessing other crime bosses fail on uniting all crime within New York, Fisk would realize that his greatest threat was Spider-man seeing how it was he who ended all the attempts. After laying low and waiting for the right moment to make his move, Fisk would finally get his wish after reading the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">Daily Bugle</a> article that claimed Spider-man to be retired from crime fighting. Instantly Fisk would force all crime to unite and rule the streets of New York City in Spider-man\u2019s absence, causing one of New York\u2019s biggest crime waves. However, Fisk would finally find himself confronting the returned Spider-man after Kingpin\u2019s men kidnapped Daily Bugle owner <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah. Jameson</a>.</p><p>Even though the hero managed to foil Fisk\u2019s crime wave again, Spider-man was unprepared for Fisk after mistaking him for a simple overweight criminal. Easily besting Spider-man in combat and knocking him out, Kingpin would order the deaths of both Jameson and Spider-man by drowning both in a sealed room. Escaping Kingpin\u2019s death trap and saving Jameson\u2019s life, Spider-man tried to take down the Kingpin again. But before Spider-man would fight the Kingpin, the hero would be sidetracked while Kingpin made his escape. Even though Fisk knew that Spider-man came very close in ending his built career and reputation, he also knew that both the hero and Jameson had little proof of Fisk\u2019s criminal activities and that him and the name \u201cKingpin\u201d weren\u2019t the same.</p><h3>The Brand of the Brainwasher</h3><p>As Fisk found himself cautiously rebuilding his his reputation as both a legit business man and a crimelord, Fisk took a new approach on having New York City under his control after secretly recruiting an Osborn employee known as Dr. Gerhard Winkler who specialized in brainwashing techniques. Funding Winkler\u2019s services who was also obtaining his equipment from Oscorp Industries and secretly opening a dance club known as Gloom Room A-Go-Go to disguise his operations, Fisk now hid behind a different alias known as the Brainwasher. The main objective that Fisk tried to accomplish was to mostly use the club as a way to brainwash important characters within New York City and have them under his control as an easier way to have him rule New York City. Also hiring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">Mary Jane</a> as a singer for the bar who was unaware of the clubs true intentions to hypnotize New York City\u2019s top officials, Fisk successfully managed to brainwash <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-george-stacy/29-2479/\">Captain George Stacy</a> into secretly working for him. However Fisk\u2019s activities was discovered by both Spider-man and MJ, but Spider-man\u2019s attempt to stop Fisk only found himself defeated and later escaping from being another brainwashed victim.</p><p>Unaware of Fisk\u2019s whereabouts, Fisk continued to use Captain Stacy as his own pawn and have Winkler continue his brainwashing techniques by moving his equipment to Osborn Industries. With Spider-man knowing about George\u2019s current status, as Peter Parker he attempted to confront George at his home which only provoked him into attacking Peter and forced him to leave his house. Notifying Fisk about Peter discovering his secret plans, Fisk ordered his men to kill Peter Parker at his home and at the Daily Bugle, which proved unsuccessful twice. Luck would turn for the worst when Winkler\u2019s employer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> would discover Fisk and Winkler\u2019s secret activities as well as Spider-man finally discovering Fisk\u2019s whereabouts at Osborn Industries. As Spider-man managed to defeat Fisk, Osborn would cause Winkler to accidentally destroy his brainwashing machine and freed George Stacy and anybody else who was under Fisk\u2019s control. With Winkler killed by the impact of the exploding machine, Fisk managed to elude authorities by escaping with one of Osborn\u2019s private helicopters.</p><h3>Crises on the Campus</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"75871\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75871-17153-kingpin_super.jpg\" title=\"Facing prior defeats and foiled attempts, Fisk decided to end his threatening obstacle Spider-man once and for all, which only gained unwanted attention from authorities that forced him into hiding.\"><img id=\"75871\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75871-17153-kingpin_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Facing prior defeats and foiled attempts, Fisk decided to end his threatening obstacle Spider-man once and for all, which only gained unwanted attention from authorities that forced him into hiding.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Facing prior defeats and foiled attempts, Fisk decided to end his threatening obstacle Spider-man once and for all, which only gained unwanted attention from authorities that forced him into hiding.</div></div></div></div><p>Upon learning that a petrified clay tablet being held at Empire State University (ESU) that possibly contained valuable secrets, Fisk would be influenced into obtaining the tablet for himself. Taking an advantage of the nearby protest, Fisk and his men broke into ESU and single handily took the tablet. With Spider-man quickly entering the scene, both Fisk and the hero fought each other until Fisk successfully managed to create a distraction in order to make his escape. Knowing that Spider-man would follow him, Fisk took the advantage to rid him of the wall-crawler who\u2019s started to become the only obstacle for Fisk\u2019s goals. As predicted, Fisk battled Spider-man once more and gain the upper hand over Spider-man. However the hero managed to cause Fisk's laser cane to backfire against him and knock the Kingpin of Crime unconscious. Defeating the Kingpin and seeing him finally be taken into police custody, Fisk managed to convince the cops that Spider-man was working for him and caused authorities to hunt down Spider-man as he was about to return the stolen tablet.</p><p>Imprisoned, Fisk promised his escape was at hand and slowly worked on bending the bars of his jail cell with his brute strength. As Spider-man handled difficulties with both law enforcement and his personal life, Fisk managed to successfully escape. Seeing Spider-man\u2019s death as a main priority, Fisk would develop another plan to attract his enemy and finally take him out once and for all. Staging a hijacking in the streets of New York, Fisk successfully managed to attract the hero into battling him once more. As the two fought each other in the streets, Fisk realized that he was bound to be defeated once more in the hands of Spider-man. It would take the interruption of J. Jonah, Jameson and Ned Leeds that distracted Spider-man long enough to have Fisk make his successful escape with a nearby car driven by his wife Vanessa Fisk. Realizing that his recent actions have managed to gain attention from the authorities, Fisk would go into hiding with his wife until tensions decreased.</p><p>His Ill-gotten wealth is supplemented by legitimate business ventures. The Kingpin has slowly amassed a large fortune and a gang of henchmen that have included, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bullseye/29-4647/\">Bullseye</a>, The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bushwacker/29-11932/\">Bushwhacker</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a>. Being the all power Kingpin of New York\u2019s criminal underworld, he made enemies with not only the heroes, but with other gangs such as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maggia/65-26082/\">Maggia</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hydra/65-3480/\">Hydra</a>. The two groups teamed up to bring Kingpin down and would eventually succeed. This forced Wilson to leave America in which he would travel to Japan. Now poor and powerless, Wilson began a spice business to try and get rich again. Eventually Wilson would gain enough money and returned to New York. Back in New York he triggers a gang war in order to bring the Maggia down. In the midst of all the chaos, Kingpin rook control of the criminal underworld again.</p><p>Meeting Vanessa was now one of the most powerful crime lords again, Wilson decided to disguise himself as a honest business man and donates a lot to charities. This caught the eye of a woman named Vanessa, whom Wilson would hook up with and would eventually marry and became Mrs. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vanessa-fisk/29-10058/\">Vanessa Fisk</a>. The couple would conceive a son and named him Richard. Vanessa was unaware of his criminal career when she married him but upon finding out, she threatened to leave him if he did not give up his criminal lifestyle. Wilson would give in to Vanessa\u2019s demands and would temporarily retire as a crime lord. The entire family moved to Japan to live peacefully, but when a gang war erupted again in New York City, it caught Wilson\u2019s eyes.</p><h3>The Secret of the Schemer</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"633158\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/633158-2_super.jpg\" title=\"A middle-aged man dressed in a colorful costume would instantly find himself as a major threat for the Kingpin and his criminal empire.\"><img id=\"633158\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/633158-2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"A middle-aged man dressed in a colorful costume would instantly find himself as a major threat for the Kingpin and his criminal empire.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A middle-aged man dressed in a colorful costume would instantly find himself as a major threat for the Kingpin and his criminal empire.</div></div></div></div><p>As Fisk was forced into hiding and struggling to hold his criminal career, Vanessa would discover an article of her son\u2019s death and suspect that Richard committed suicide after discovering his father\u2019s criminal life because of how Fisk withheld this information from her. Matters would turn for the worst when a new self-proclaimed crime lord who called himself the Schemer took an advantage over Fisk\u2019s status and crippled what remained of his empire. In retaliation, Fisk would secretly cover his identity and place an add within the Daily Bugle newspaper that offered five thousand dollars for the capture of the Schemer. As Schemer and his gang penetrated Fisk\u2019s forces and his mansion, he also attracted Spiderman who was on his trail in hopes of gaining the reward money for Schemers capture. With Schemer confronting Fisk at his home, Vanessa recognized who the Schemer really was. As Spiderman entered the scene, both Fisk and the hero would fight again as the Schemer would flee from the scene with Vanessa. Fisk would later make his escape after causing Spiderman to lose his balance during the fight and tried to locate his wife.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"350055\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12840/350055-127753-richard-fisk_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"350055\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12840/350055-127753-richard-fisk_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Instantly reunited with Vanessa, who was distasteful from the dangers of Fisk\u2019s criminal lifestyle. Spider-man would finally capture the Schemer and take the villain to the address that offered the reward money. However Spider-man would realize that it was a ruse from the Kingpin who captured both Spider-man and Schemer in a steel net. Knowing that his wife suspected something about the Schemer, Fisk forced the Schemer to tell the truth about himself and discovered an angered Richard after removing his mask. Revealing that he regretted using his fathers crime money throughout most of his growing life and personally wanted to see his fathers criminal empire come to an end. This would cause Fisk to go into a catatonic state, while the on looking Spiderman felt that his involvement with Fisk and his family issues weren\u2019t needed as he left them to their own fate.</p><h3>The Big Sleep in Las Vegas</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"541732\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/541732-king_super.jpg\" title=\"Kingpin would be unaware that he was manipulated into fighting Captain America, which was a start for a trap set by the Red Skull.\"><img id=\"541732\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/541732-king_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kingpin would be unaware that he was manipulated into fighting Captain America, which was a start for a trap set by the Red Skull.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kingpin would be unaware that he was manipulated into fighting Captain America, which was a start for a trap set by the Red Skull.</div></div></div></div><p>Richard would later regret his actions when he had no intention of harming his father in any way. Feeling guilty for his actions as the Schemer, Richard would join the terrorist organization known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hydra/65-3480/\">HYDRA</a> and quickly rise through the ranks claiming the title known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supreme-hydra/29-16040/\">Supreme HYDRA</a>. Using HYDRA\u2019s resources and equipment to revive his father, Richard would repay his debt to his father by handing him the organization. Seeing this as an opportunity to rule the city of Las Vegas and then the world itself, Fisk wasted no time on controlling HYDRA\u2019s operations and army to do his bidding. Capturing the attention of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a>, Fisk would be defeated by both heroes before realizing the truth of his involvement within HYDRA. Discovering that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-skull/29-2250/\">Red Skull</a> who was the true leader of HYDRA manipulated him. Fisk and his son would form an alliance with both heroes as they defeated the Red Skull\u2019s attempt on destroying Captain America and Las Vegas with his revived <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-sleeper/29-38806/\">Sleeper</a> robot. Even though Fisk succeeded on helping Red Skull\u2019s defeat, his son Richard would suffer major injuries that forced Fisk to keep him contained in cryogenic stasis.

Dedicated into reviving his dying son, Fisk would change his alias as \u201cThe Boss\u201d and instantly chose his enemy Spiderman as the perfect candidate to trade life forces with his son. Carefully watching his tracks and planning every step to ensure his involvement is kept hidden, Fisk hired the villains Sandman, Tinkerer, and several hired men into capturing Spider-man. Using his hired men into having Spider-man follow them to his hideout, Spider-man would eventually trace Fisk\u2019s henchmen to an abandoned movie studio where an awaiting Fisk would successfully capture the unprepared hero.</p><p>As Fisk strapped Spider-man into a machine along with his dying son, he successfully transferred Spider-man life force onto Richards. Despite her disagreement with Fisk's methods of restoring their son, she set aside her differences after seeing her son fully revived. With Spider-man weakened and left with six hours to live, Fisk had his men toss Spiderman\u2019s weakened body onto streets from a speeding car. However Spider-man managed to get help from Dr. Conners with an energy-siphoning machine before tracking down Kingpin and his family in a Navy Yard. Even though Spider-man successfully restored his life energy, Richard was already fully rejuvenated. Having a brief battle with Fisk, the Kingpin would accidentally fall to his seemingly death. Even though Vanessa believed that she lost her husband, she still gave Spider-man thanks for his unwilling help on restoring her son\u2019s health and promised him that she and Richard wouldn\u2019t be threat for Spider-man or New York City ever again.</p><h3>The Last Twenty-Four Hours</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"75870\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75870-162482-kingpin_super.jpg\" title=\"Believing to be his final fight against Spiderman, Fisk would gain an ultimate victory and was a split second away from killing the hero.\"><img id=\"75870\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75870-162482-kingpin_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Believing to be his final fight against Spiderman, Fisk would gain an ultimate victory and was a split second away from killing the hero.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Believing to be his final fight against Spiderman, Fisk would gain an ultimate victory and was a split second away from killing the hero.</div></div></div></div><p>Believed to be dead, Fisk managed to survive from the underwater wreckage after his fight against Spiderman. Temporarily Fisk became amnesiac from the fall and wanders aimlessly within the streets. Another competing crime-lord known as Silvermane would learn of this and instantly placed a hit and run on Fisk. Almost killing Fisk, Silvermane\u2019s hired henchmen failed as Fisk was taken to a nearby hospital that treated his injuries from the hit and run attack. Slowly regaining his memory, Fisk returned home to a shocked Vanessa. Growing tired of living in a dangerous lifestyle and possibly losing a loving family member, Vanessa forced Kingpin into making a choice between herself or his career as the Kingpin. Realizing that surrendering such a position would take time, Vanessa would give Fisk twenty-four hours to make his choice and finish whatever he needed to do as the Kingpin of Crime.</p><p>As six hours remained on Fisk\u2019s time clock, Fisk decided to end his career with the death of Spider-man. Easily having his men abduct Spider-man and bring him to his home, Kingpin would face Spider-man in their last fight to the death. Both Spider-man and Fisk would battle each in a dragged out fight that took itself throughout Fisk\u2019s mansion. Managing to gain the advantage over Spider-man, Fisk pummeled the defeated hero. As Fisk was about to give Spider-man a killing blow, Vanessa interrupted him because of his timeline was up and now he had to choose. As Fisk pleaded with Vanessa to spare him a few more minutes, she forced him to spare Spiderman\u2019s life as he chose to end his criminal career and move to China with his wife.</p><h3>The Kingpin Must Die</h3><p>Briefly retired in Japan with his wife, Fisk would be offered a deal with a Attorney General to hand over files of incriminating evidence that would place the remaining crime-lords in New York into custody. Strongly influenced by his wife to precede with the deal, clear his name, and offer the hefty reward for his troubles, Fisk agreed to the attorney\u2019s offer. However a legal representative was needed and Fisk\u2019s wife would return to New York City to hire Matt Murdock and Foggy Nelson to represent their case. However, the remaining crime-lords learned of Fisk\u2019s current goals and anticipated this by kidnapping Vanessa in exchange for the files. Forced back into New York City to proceed with the exchange, Fisk would easily anticipate an attack orchestrated by the crime-lords that found himself returning to his role as the Kingpin of Crime, promising that the city would suffer from bloodshed if Vanessa was harmed or killed.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"496187\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/496187-kingpin_super.jpg\" title=\"From the first time Kingpin fought the meddling Daredevil, he would later find himself against the greatest threat towards his reputation.\"><img id=\"496187\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/496187-kingpin_medium.jpg\" alt=\"From the first time Kingpin fought the meddling Daredevil, he would later find himself against the greatest threat towards his reputation.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">From the first time Kingpin fought the meddling Daredevil, he would later find himself against the greatest threat towards his reputation.</div></div></div></div><p>As Fisk returned to his role as the Kingpin of Crime with the help of his new right-hand man named Lynch, Fisk\u2019s operation would find itself being infiltrated by Daredevil who was disguised as a henchman named \u201cShades\u201d. Fisk would discover eventually Daredevil infiltration and both would fight for the very first time in a darkened vault. Even though Daredevil had the advantage over Fisk, it would take one blow to Daredevils head that made Fisk the victor of the fight. Ordering his men to dispose Daredevil, Fisk would next attempt to bargain with the crime-lords in order to rescue his wife. However, unknown to Fisk his right hand man Lynch would cause the exchange to go horribly wrong when he caused an accident that convinced the Kingpin that his wife was dead.</p><p>Unable to find her body, Fisk was convinced that Vanessa was officially dead. Instantly, Fisk planned to gain his revenge against the crime lords for the cause of his wife\u2019s death by anticipating their attempt to have him assassinated by Bullseye. Knowing that Bullseye would strike at his meeting with the crime lords, Fisk would make a higher offer to Bullseye by promising him a career and a reputation as the greatest assassin in New York City, an offer that Bullseye couldn\u2019t refuse as his chief assassin. Bullseye killed the crime lords under Fisk\u2019s first assignment and was next ordered to kill a new threat arising towards Fisk, which was Daredevil. However Bullseye proved unsuccessful and was defeated by Daredevil while Fisk witnessed the entire fight. Offering the victorious Daredevil a career as his chief assassin, the hero refused Fisk's offer swearing that he would put an end to Fisk's activities.</p><h3>The Deal</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"613261\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/613261-cherryh_super.jpg\" title=\"Randolp Cherryh becoming Mayor was Fisks secret attempt to rule over New York City.\"><img id=\"613261\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/613261-cherryh_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Randolp Cherryh becoming Mayor was Fisks secret attempt to rule over New York City.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Randolp Cherryh becoming Mayor was Fisks secret attempt to rule over New York City.</div></div></div></div><p>With Fisk returning to his role as the Kingpin of New York City, he was unaware that Vanessa survived the attack and was hidden underground as a servant of a diabolical massive man who resembled Fisk and was known as King. With her psych fragile and unbalanced after the series of traumatizing events, Vanessa would be fully unaware of her being and would believe that King was indeed her husband. Daredevil and Ben <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ben-urich/29-4799/\">Urich</a> would discover this and Daredevil would venture into New York City\u2019s underground where he successfully defeated King and rescued Vanessa from his clutches. Elsewhere Fisk would attempt to have New York City in his control when appointing his agent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/randolph-cherryh/29-31866/\">Randolph Cherryh</a> to be the next mayor of New York City. With Daredevil realizing Kingpin\u2019s plans, he would visit Fisk with proof that his wife was still alive and that if he wanted to see her again he would have to remove Cherryh from office. Angered as to how Daredevil would get the better of him, Fisk disbanded his attempt to appoint Cherryh as mayor and was reunited with his wife once more.</p><h3>Kingpin's Chief Assassins</h3><p>In retaliation towards Daredevil foiling his scheme, Fisk would send his new chief assassin <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a> to kill Foggy Nelson. But she would decline the contract when Foggy recognized her as Matt Murdocks former lover. Elsewhere Bullseye desperately tried to regain his position as chief assassin and brutally murdered Elektra so that he could easily reclaim the title. Fisk would reconsider Bullseye\u2019s reemployment when he claimed that the blind lawyer Matt Murdock and Daredevil were the same man. Even though Fisk slightly believed Bullseye, he demanded that Bullseye show proof of his claim and he would consider him as his chief assassin. With Bullseye ultimately defeated by Daredevil and unable to show any proof, Fisk would find himself believing that Bullseye\u2019s services weren\u2019t no longer needed.</p><h3>Rising of New Threats</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"194402\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1714/194402-93387-micah-synn_super.jpg\" title=\"The savage jungle lord Micah Synn would become a major threat for Fisk's organization and his family.\"><img id=\"194402\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1714/194402-93387-micah-synn_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The savage jungle lord Micah Synn would become a major threat for Fisk's organization and his family.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The savage jungle lord Micah Synn would become a major threat for Fisk's organization and his family.</div></div></div></div><p>As time went on, new threats began to arise for the Kingpin. Starting by recruiting the maniacal cult leader known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/micah-synn/29-31496/\">Micah Synn</a>. Knowing how Micah\u2019s reputation has proved useful against Daredevil and could help Fisk criminal career, Fisk would later disregard Micah\u2019s barbaric interest with women, mostly those who are married. Fisk personally warned Synn that actions towards the wives of any men were unacceptable and not tolerated within his organization (an action that Fisk would violate later on within his career). Ignoring this, Synn would attempt to kidnap the wife of Foggy Nelson at a local Christmas party. With Daredevil intervening, Micah would gain the upper hand until Fisk got involved to ensure Daredevils victory.</p><p>Because of this, Micah became a major threat towards Fisk\u2019s organization when him and his tribe were hijacking illicit shipments from Fisk. With Micah becoming a major problem for Fisk, he would anticipate Micah kidnapping his wife Vanessa by having an actress disguised as Vanessa. Assisting Daredevil on bringing down Micah\u2019s reign of terror, the hero managed to overcome Micah\u2019s forces and drive the madman into hiding where Fisk would constantly hunt him down.</p><p>Fisk would later be involved with Daily Bugle when he learned that the sleazy publisher Milton Farr carried valuable evidence that could bring down Fisk\u2019s operation. Managing to send his hired men to destroy the evidence, Fisk would also see to it that Milton would meet his death for his unsuccessful attempts against the Kingpin. Fisk next assisted Spiderman on taking down the mysterious <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hobgoblin-kingsley/29-7605/\">Hobgoblin</a> because of how he would prove to be a potential threat for Fisk\u2019s organization.</p><h3>Crime and Punishment</h3><p>With <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Doctor Octopus</a> dedicated on destroying New York City with an Activator that was in Fisk\u2019s possession, Fisk anticipated this with a fake one for Dr Octopus\u2019s hired men to steal. However, the well-famous cat burglar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a> would see the value of the item and steal it for herself. Eventually the real Activator came into Dr Octopus\u2019s possession and almost destroyed the city. Later the vigilante known as Punisher would be drugged by Jigsaw into causing chaos in the streets and eventually find himself going against the Kingpin himself. Easily besting the vigilante in combat, Fisk left the unconscious Punisher to Spiderman and the arriving authorities. Discovering how Dr Octopus managed to obtain the real Activator, Kingpin would desire revenge against Black Cat for her selfish and careless actions.</p><p>As Vanessa frequently went into psychotic episodes because of the prior traumatic experiences she went through, Fisk was dedicated on restoring his wife to full health. Taking notice how one of his longtime agents <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-answer/29-7779/\">Aaron Nicholson</a> had the unique ability to solve just about every problem, Fisk would empower Nicholson in attempts of helping Fisk handle the current problems that proved to be too difficult for Fisk to handle alone. Secretly Fisk used the same machinery to embed Black Cat powers of having bad luck for those who posed a threat to her. Even though she did this because of how she wanted to be a better crime-fighting partner for Spiderman, Fisk would reveal his identity and attempt to have Black Cat work for him in return for the powers. Accepting Fisk's demands, Black Cat strictly told Fisk that she would do what he asked of her only if it doesn\u2019t involve harming Spiderman.</p><h3>The Answer</h3><p>With Nicholson taking the costume identity known as the Answer, he would serve as an advisor for Fisk in his multiple plots against Spiderman and Black Cat. Advising and helping Fisk on obtaining <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silvermane/29-13846/\">Silvermane</a>\u2019s lifeless robotic to be used as a potential assassin, Answer would also recommend that the powers of the vigilante known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagger/29-1935/\">Dagger</a> could restore Vanessa to full health. However the lifeless Silvermane would reclaim his lost lifeforce from Dagger and successfully escape, leaving little hope for Fisk\u2019s wife returning to normal. Kidnapping Dagger, the loyal Answer sacrificed his lifeforces into her so that she could restore Vanessa\u2019s health. However Dagger ignored Kingpin\u2019s persistence and refused to help Vanessa. Fisk would find himself blaming both Spiderman and Black Cat for this because of how they meddled in his plans and proudly reveal the true nature of Black Cats powers. Revealing that those around her would risk their lives because of her bad luck, even Spiderman. Believing that he was the cause for their separation, it would be because of Spiderman\u2019s concerns for their relationship that would be the cause for their break-up</p><h3>Born Again</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"909802\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12611/909802-01_ori_007_super.jpg\" title=\"Kingpin would ultimately gain his revenge against Daredevil when he forced the hero to live in the same streets that he defended throughout his heroic career.\"><img id=\"909802\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/12611/909802-01_ori_007_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Kingpin would ultimately gain his revenge against Daredevil when he forced the hero to live in the same streets that he defended throughout his heroic career.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kingpin would ultimately gain his revenge against Daredevil when he forced the hero to live in the same streets that he defended throughout his heroic career.</div></div></div></div><p>Desperate on saving his wife, Fisk forced psychologist Dr. Paul Mondat\u2019s assistance when Fisk kidnapped his wife. However this plan turned against Fisk when Mondat managed to not only restore Vanessa\u2019s mental health, but also made her loyal only to him and that Daredevil managed to rescue Mondat\u2019s wife from Fisk's captivity. Forced into admitting defeat after seeing his wife afraid of him, Fisk allowed Mondat to take Vanessa to Europe for further treatment. Angered as to how his attempt to save wife turned against him because of Daredevil, Fisk would finally get the revenge he long desired against the hero when his former girlfriend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karen-page/29-4486/\">Karen Page</a> traded Daredevil\u2019s secret identity in exchange for drugs.</p><p>Now believing that the blind lawyer Matt Murdock was indeed Daredevil, Fisk would completely destroy Murdock's life when Fisk caused Murdock to lose his career and private lifestyle. Forcing the hero into the streets, the angered Daredevil tried to take his revenge against Fisk only to find himself brutally beaten and nearly dying from a staged death. Kingpin would later suspect that Daredevil was alive and hired a psychopath to take Daredevils identity and kill Nelson and Page to draw out Daredevil to be sure that Matt Murdock was indeed killed in the local river. As predicted, Daredevil was alive which caused Fisk to proceed with his next plan, which was to use his connections with the government.</p><p>Using his recommended status to gain favors from the government, Fisk would hire one of their greatest soldiers-of-fortune <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nuke/29-41866/\">Nuke</a> (who was secretly used and manipulated for corrupt reasons) to draw out Daredevil. Sending Nuke to cause property damage in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and successfully drawing out Daredevil, the hero managed to defeat Nuke only to see him be taken into custody by the Avengers. With Fisk realizing how this plan backfired against him was killing off innocent civilians, matters would turn for the worst when Nuke successfully escaped to create more chaos and attack the Daily Bugle. With both Captain America and Daredevil trying to stop Nuke, the government would kill Nuke in an desperate attempt to cover their tracks. However Nuke would be Daredevils revenge against Fisk when he finally exposed the Kingpins true nature with the public and force the Kingpin to step down from his position and go into hiding.</p><h3>The Rose</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"615446\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/615446-rose2_super.jpg\" title=\"Fisks son Richard would once more be a threat for his father as the Rose, who later became a key member in the massive Gang War after his father disappeared.\"><img id=\"615446\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15776/615446-rose2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fisks son Richard would once more be a threat for his father as the Rose, who later became a key member in the massive Gang War after his father disappeared.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fisks son Richard would once more be a threat for his father as the Rose, who later became a key member in the massive Gang War after his father disappeared.</div></div></div></div><p>Prior to Fisk's attempt on ruining Daredevil\u2019s life, his son Richard would learn of the events that recently happened to his mother and return to his goals of seeing his father\u2019s organization fall while taking a new identity known as the Rose. Even though Rose\u2019s attempts proved unsuccessful and was more strongly against Spiderman, Fisk deduced Rose\u2019s identity and continued to let Richard take the disguise under a watchful eye. After Fisk disappeared, his son Richard attempted to claim his father\u2019s position as the Kingpin of Crime, only to find that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammerhead/29-6817/\">Hammerhead</a>, Silvermane, the Blue Boys, and other gang leaders and crime lords also wanted the position as well. Becoming the very start for a massive gang war that later drew attention from other villains, heroes, and even the Punisher, chaos ran amok in the streets that claimed the lives of innocents bystanders and law enforcement.</p><h3>Gang War</h3><p>Elsewhere, Kingpin would learn that his wife Vanessa would be endangered in Europe and ordered her to return to America to be kept in close supervision and in care of the appointed Dr. Zachar. Even though Fisk was hidden in unknown location and that Vanessa\u2019s condition was improving, he would realize that Dr. Zachar heavily drugged and scolded Vanessa. When the government contacting Fisk in a desperate attempt to have him reclaim his position, Fisk proudly made his return. First thing that Fisk did was ensure that Dr. Zachar died for his abuse against Vanessa, next part of his plan was to eliminate his lieutenants that he saw to be ineffective. Knowing that the meddling heroes Daredevil and Spiderman would be involved in his plans, Fisk decided to use them as an advantage when both heroes sent Fisk's lieutenants to prison in an effort to save them. Secretly Fisk did this in order to have his wife Vanessa returned to Europe safely and have more control of what was left of his organization. Fisk would still be angered and blaming Spiderman for having his power shared with both Hammerhead and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chameleon/29-4458/\">Chameleon</a>.</p><h3>Losing the Empire</h3><p>Later Kingpin would lose his entire criminal empire when he was stabbed in the back due to one of his employees working for his son Richard. Vanessa would kill Richard and flee the country with Wilson\u2019s remaining fortune. All this happens while the Kingpin was recuperating in a European country. He would later come up with a plan that will free him from the FBI and regain his fortune. He would reveal to the FBI proof that Matt Murdock was really Daredevil. While he was staying in prison, Fisk had many enemies and would constantly be under the attack by someone. However, Fisk succeeded in forcing the FBI to wound Daredevil in which he would be taken to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/night-nurse/29-40905/\">Night Nurse</a>. Fisk would meet with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ben-urich/29-4799/\">Ben Urich</a> and force him to tell the FBI where the Night Nurse is or go to jail.</p><p>The FBI was able to successfully arrest Matt Murdock but betrays Wilson at the same time and arrested him instead of letting him free. They would place Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk in the same jail hoping that the two would kill each other. However, during a riot that was aimed to kill both of them, the two would team up in order to survive the riot. When Wilson wanted to free Bullseye, Matt refused to let that criminal free. Then Bullseye would shoot Wilson in the knees but was actually trying to shoot Matt.</p><h3>Civil War</h3><p>During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a> Wilson Fisk offered a deal to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> that he will give him the location of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> if Iron Man will set him free. However, Fisk gave him the information of the base of a group of villains that were gathering that were planning to create a new criminal empire ran by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammerhead/29-6817/\">Hammerhead</a>. Recently Wilson puts a hit on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> and his loved ones. The sniper was able to hit one of them, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aunt-may/29-1780/\">Aunt May</a> When Peter gets to \"persuade\" the sniper to tell him who put the hit on him and his family, He went to the prison giving Fisk a severe beating who is unable to defend himself from Spider-Man's fuel-raged, brutal attacks and threatens to cut off Fisk's air supply with his webbing, but lets him live. With the other inmates watching in awe, Peter warns everyone that he will kill anyone whoever harms his family again. When Matt dropped the charges against Fisk, for him to leave the country and his citizenship at the request of Vanessa.</p><p>Matt also delayed the case long enough for Fisk to miss his wife's funeral, but he would later go to her grave and mourn for her death. Fisk left America and went to Spain where he fell in love with a local woman and he moved in with her and her kids. After Daredevil refused to take the role as leader of the Hand, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-bullseye/29-55499/\">Lady Bullseye</a> and her group of assassins murdered Fisk's new love and her family. She told him that he was going to help her convince Daredevil to lead the Hand. Fisk comes back to America and offers Daredevil his help in destroying the Hand. When asked what he plans to do after they take out the Hand Fisk replies that he doesn't plan on surviving. Daredevil accepts the offer and Fisk returns to the criminal underworld with his new assistant <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/turk/29-9039/\">Turk</a> to recruit soldiers for their war, he then has his men go out and start killing members of the Hand across the city. Fisk breaks the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/owl/29-13908/\">Owl</a> out of police custody during transport and has him hire Lady Bullseye for reasons yet to be revealed.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p>Kingpin and Lady Bullseye confront Luke Cage &amp; Iron Fist at a soup kitchen owned by Danny Rand. He tells them that Daredevil needs to be taken down.</p><p>Later he and Lady Bullseye summon the Ghost Rider using some stolen scrolls from the Hand, causing DD to think that his hero friends were distracting him while Ghost Rider attacked Shadowland's dungeons.</p><h2>Skills &amp; Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"735958\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/735958-kingpin1_super.jpg\" title=\"Fisk takes great pride on using his overweight appearance as an advantage over his unsuspected enemies who see's him as a simple fat man.\"><img id=\"735958\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/735958-kingpin1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Fisk takes great pride on using his overweight appearance as an advantage over his unsuspected enemies who see's him as a simple fat man.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fisk takes great pride on using his overweight appearance as an advantage over his unsuspected enemies who see's him as a simple fat man.</div></div></div></div><p>Kingpin has many extraordinary skills and abilities. As a human he does have a unique physique that he proudly displays as a simple overweight man. Even though he physically does have an overweight appearance, Kingpin\u2019s body mass is mostly made of pure muscle rather than fatty tissue. Kingpin is also extremely fast, agile, and incredibly strong for a man his size and weight. Easily lifting a full \u2013size oak desk and using it as a weapon and capable of standing toe-to-toe with super-powered individuals, Fisk\u2019s physique does make him an extremely dangerous opponent for others. Aside from his display of physical capabilities, Fisk\u2019s body also protects him from several lethal attacks such stab wounds and gunshots blasts.</p><p>Since childhood, Fisk has dedicated himself in training the oriental arts of sumo, hapkido, and others. These were combined with his physical prowess to create his own fighting style. Over the years Fisk has also adapted other fighting styles such as wrestling, street fighting, and other martial arts. On a daily basis Fisk trains himself with at least six hired martial artists who are sometimes armed with weapons and do not hold back on their attacks against Fisk. Throughout his career Fisk has easily bested other well-known martial artists and fighters like Daredevil, Punisher, Spiderman, Captain America and the notorious villain known as the Red Skull.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"180860\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/180860-129515-kingpin_super.jpg\" title=\"As a business man, Fisk mostly runs his criminal operation behind his desk hidden within his legit reputation among New York City.\"><img id=\"180860\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/180860-129515-kingpin_medium.jpg\" alt=\"As a business man, Fisk mostly runs his criminal operation behind his desk hidden within his legit reputation among New York City.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">As a business man, Fisk mostly runs his criminal operation behind his desk hidden within his legit reputation among New York City.</div></div></div></div><p>Even though Fisk participates within the fields of business for illegal means, he's a very skilled financier, planner, and a successful founder of several companies that's under his name. Aside from his life of crime as the Kingpin, Fisk has helped New York City on several occasions by opening businesses to increase New York City\u2019s status and funding several charity campaigns to increase a positive view from the population. Because of this, many people find it difficult to believe that Fisk is responsible for the crimes he\u2019s accused of and that he\u2019s a victim of vigilantism from heroes like Spiderman, Punisher, and Daredevil.</p><p>Even though Fisk has barely involved himself with politics and electoral campaigns, he\u2019s also experienced within the fields of political science and other government funded activities. Aside from his knowledge as a major figure within the world business, Fisk is also a skilled criminal mastermind. However Fisk later preferred to refrain himself as a mastermind such as the likes of Dr Doom and Red Skull seeing how his goals were unrealistic and almost ended his long built career.</p><p>Mostly Fisk physically refrains himself from his criminal activities and strictly acts through his criminal employers and hired assassins to do his bidding. It\u2019s very rare for Fisk to be physically involved in attacking his enemies unless he\u2019s provoked, confronted, or prefers to handle an opponent himself. Having connections with government agencies, businesses, specialists, scientists, henchmen, pushers, law enforcement, criminal gangs, terrorist groups, villains, and heroes who all served Kingpin through fear, dedication, and manipulation.</p><p>Mentally skilled and disciplined, Fisk is also immune to hypnotism or anything that results him losing his will. Even the will-sapping Purple Man found himself unable to control Fisk or have the him under his influence.</p><h3>Kingpin of Crime</h3><p>The title known as \u201cThe Kingpin of Crime\u201d first began as a simple nickname that was given to Fisk during his teenage years and later became a self-proclaimed title that was feared throughout the East Coast. Even though several crime bosses were unsuccessful on forming a massive coalition under their control, Fisk\u2019s self-proclaimed title became legit after managing to form almost all of gangs and organizations (non-Maggia) under his command. As a title that was instantly desired by competing crime lords and villains, Fisk would be the only man who successfully controlled the title and the power within the criminal underworld. As the Kingpin, Fisk would position himself as a man who controlled almost all crime within New York at a standard balance. Meaning that if he was removed from his position, an all out gang war would most likely breakout, as other leaders would compete each other for the title.</p><p>Even though Fisk was later removed from his position, other people would later claim the title for themselves. People such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alfredo-morelli/29-26331/\">Alfredo Morelli</a> who later couldn\u2019t handle the position as the Kingpin, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">Robbie Parker</a> who used the title after forming a massive army of super-villains, and even Daredevil on an desperate attempt to have the title end with him. But out of all the men who held the title, only Fisk would dedicate his life to the dangers and responsibilities as the Kingpin of Crime.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>During the Silver Age and early Bronze Age of comics, Fisk carried concealed weaponry that he mostly kept on himself and other funded equipment that involved brainwashing or draining one\u2019s life force.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"729533\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/729533-blademorbiusbite_super.jpg\" title=\"A trademark weapon that Fisk formerly used was his walking stick that concealed various weaponry.\"><img id=\"729533\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/729533-blademorbiusbite_medium.jpg\" alt=\"A trademark weapon that Fisk formerly used was his walking stick that concealed various weaponry.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">A trademark weapon that Fisk formerly used was his walking stick that concealed various weaponry.</div></div></div></div><p><strong>Obliterator Cane</strong></p><p>Fisk usually carried a walking stick that acted as his main weapon for offensive purposes during the Silver Age of Comics. Inside the stick is a charge that compresses and stores energy within the stick, which is only released from a hidden button located on the upper portion of the stick. Bottom portion of the stick consists of a rare metal that steers the blast in the desired location. Depending on the amount of energy is stored within the stick, the blast could range from simply knocking out a person to vaporizing anything it hits. The glass head of the stick conceals compressed knockout gas that can be released from a separate button on the upper portion of the stick. However the knockout gas can only be used for close encounters due to it\u2019s short range after being released. Third feature is how the stick acts like a remote for various traps, equipment, or other appliances that the Kingpin owns.</p><p>Kingpin also carries a diamond stick pin on him that sprays knockout gas for close encounters.</p><p>After Frank Miller began writing for Daredevil, Kingpin\u2019s use of science-fiction related weaponry was decreased and rarely seen, still Fisk carries these weapons that he strictly uses as a last resort against his enemies.</p><h2>Alternate Universes</h2><h3>Ultimate Kingpin</h3><p>In the Ultimate Marvel Universe, the Kingpin is almost identical to his 616 counterpart. He is seen as a gigantically large man, with a bald head, and wears a white suit with a cane. His skin tone is a little darker but that is the only difference. The Kingpin is a corporate crime lord that uses murdering and bribing to get what he wants. He has employed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/electro/29-3228/\">Electro</a>, Elektra, and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/enforcers/65-32265/\">Enforcers</a> to battle his enemies. He has also encountered Spider-Man and Daredevil, and also seems to have a vendetta against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a>. Vanessa Fisk is shown to be in a coma that the Kingpin is trying to cure with an ancient tablet that he stole. However, the Kingpin lost the tablet due to the Black Cat stealing it for revenge.</p><p>Recently, he faced the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimate-knights/65-43062/\">Ultimate Knights</a>, but when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> betrayed the team for the life of his daughter, the Kingpin systemically begin to defeat them per individual. He was only stopped when a vengeful Daredevil threatened to break Vanessa's neck that was prevented by Spider-Man. the Kingpin was later arrested while attempting to flee the country, thanks to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moon-knight/29-1493/\">Moon Knight</a>, who went to the police and told of his activities, at the cost of his secret identity being compromised.</p><p>During the first issue of the Ultimate Comics Ultimate-Spider-man series, The Kingpin returned and resumed his rightful throne as Kingpin of Crime. Unfortunately, he was greeted by an unexpected visitor. Mysterio threw the kingpin out the window into the streets of New York City, saying it would be good for his resume.</p><h3>Earth 295: Age of Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1930297\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1930297-dirigible_super.jpg\" title=\"Dirigible\"><img id=\"1930297\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5774/1930297-dirigible_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dirigible\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dirigible</div></div></div></div><p>Known as Dirigible in this alternate reality, Fisk was a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a>, along with teammates <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arcade/29-8429/\">Arcade</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/owl/29-13908/\">Owl</a>, and Red (this universe's version of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">Green Goblin</a>).

His mother encouraged the young Otto, already a good student, to push himself in school, in the hopes that he would have a better life than his factory worker father. Otto was awarded a <a href=\"#\">scholarship</a> for university, shortly before his father died in a workplace accident. Becoming obsessed with schoolwork after his father's death, Otto applied himself even harder to his studies in science. He graduated and got work with an engineering firm, soon becoming a respected nuclear physicist and research consultant, as well as working as an inventor and lecturer. He soon developed a remarkable invention- a chest harness that connected the wearer to four mechanical arms. This invention earned him a new nickname: Doctor Octopus. Around this time, he became involved with a fellow researcher, <a href=\"/mary-alice-anders/29-16124/\">Mary Alice Anders</a>, to whom he eventually proposed marriage. However, the happy couple was broken up by Otto's mother, who disapproved of the young bride-to-be. Otto broke off the engagement at his mother's behest, but she died soon after in the middle of an argument with her son. Having lost all of his social ties, Otto became more withdrawn and sullen, and grew obsessively dedicated to his work while simultaneously throwing professional and operational caution to the wind.</p><p>This recklessness with his personal safety lead directly to an accident that would change his life forever. A radiation leak in the lab caused an explosion, which fused the harness and limbs onto his body. The radiation simultaneously caused mutations in his brain, allowing him to have direct control over the arms through telepathy. Driven insane by the accident and the damage it had caused to his body and mind, Doctor Octopus became dedicated to a life of crime.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Doctor Octopus was created by <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/steve-ditko/26-4026/\">Steve Ditko</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>When first introduced, his powers, including the telepathic control, were explained as a direct result of the accident that fused the harness to his body in the first place. Later stories hinted that he may have possessed low-level telepathy from a young age, which was in turn implied to have caused a brain aneurysm in his father.</p><p>He briefly abandoned the Doctor Octopus identity, creating the identity of the \"Master Planner,\" a criminal mastermind, to orchestrate his plots. However, he eventually resumed the Doctor Octopus identity.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Sinister Six</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2246453\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79429/2246453-panel_asmann001b.jpg\" title=\"Formation of the Six\"><img id=\"2246453\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79429/2246453-panel_asmann001b_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Formation of the Six\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Formation of the Six</div></div></div></div><p>Doctor Octopus is the impetus for the formation of the original <a href=\"/sinister-six/65-40429/\">Sinister Six</a>, which occurs following a series of defeats at the hands of <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>.

He can use them to lift a maximum of three tonnes per arm, though at least one arm must support his body, and he can use them similarly to legs, to lift his body and move rapidly over a variety of terrains, and also to scale walls. He wears an armoured body suit because, while capable of dishing out an enhanced beating, his body is that of a regular human, and has become increasingly worn down by the constant fighting and injuries he has sustained. This suit adds an additional four cybernetic arms. His telepathic control also extends over an army of octobots, small, eight-limbed robots.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>House of M</h3><p>Doctor Octopus is a researcher working for the government, involved in the field of stem cell research.</p><h3>Marvel 1602</h3><p>Baron Octavius is an <a href=\"/italy/34-55920/\">Italian</a> baron living in <a href=\"/france/34-55778/\">France</a>.

She is voiced by Tara Strong. As head scientist for Alchemax's Shadow Division Dr. Serena Patel is responsible for conducting horrific experiments and creating highly advanced, dangerous weaponry, all of which she sees as nothing more than scientific endeavours. Upon learning of Spider-man's conquest against Alchemax she fears the worst for her twisted ambitions, and as a preemptive measure takes to manufacturing a battlesuit similar to that of her idol, and present time counterpart, Otto Octavius. Believing the Heroic Age Spider-man was killed by Octavius she sets in motions plans to defeat Spider-man 2099, which involves manipulating the simple-minded Scorpion a.k.a Kron Stone, and the creation of the unidentified Hobgoblin. Having discovered a fragment from the tablet of Order and Chaos her sanity is pushed over the edge, evidenced by the creation of a condensed matter reactor and development of megalomaniacal aspirations, such as world domination. The first encounter between her and Spider-man results in him initiating a self-destruct sequence for her base of operations. Both escape unscathed and engage each other once again at the, previously built, condensed matter reactor. To avert the destruction of this weapon she unleashes creatures fitted with her tentacle technology, as Spider-man attempts to bring down four reactor power core. She is, however, unsuccessful and defeated by Spider-man 2099, while he reclaims the tablet fragment.</p><h4>Spider-man: Edge of Time</h4><p>A consequence of Walter Sloan's (company 'founder') machinations mean that Alchemax was formed in the seventies, far earlier than it had previously been established. Doctor Octopus, voiced by Dave B. Mitchell, due to the altered timeline, appears as a citizen that had never taken up criminal activities. He is, instead, an employed scientist for Alchemax who retains his four mechanical tentacles but utilizes them for his research rather than villainous purposes. His primary appearance is only brief, albeit an integral piece of the storyline towards the climax though. While he and Sloan use a mind-controlled Anti-Venom to subdue and kill the original Spider-man, they are foiled at the last second by the intervention of Spider-man 2099 (Miguel O'Hara) and all three are pushed into the temporal gateway, resulting in their merger and the formation of a creature that comes to be known as Atrocity, which closely resembles an enlarged Anti-Venom with tentacles. The two Spidermen soon discover the identity of this beast and realise they must reverse this process by separating them using the temporal gateway. While Spider-man battles the Atrocity, Spider-man 2099 faces off against the Alchemax CEO which, coincidentally, is revealed to be a corrupt, future incarnation of Peter Parker. As the Atrocity's tentacles are systematically removed and tossed into the portal, they arrive as aid for Miguel O'Hara when they momentarily disable Alchemax's CEO.</p>", "deck": "A former nuclear physicist and atomic researcher, Dr. Otto Octavius' life changed forever when one of his experiments went horribly wrong.

For more information on various hosts go to their respective pages.</b></i></p><h2>Origin</h2><p>Venom is of a race of alien symbiotes that are formed from a thick, liquid, organic material. They, as their symbiotic nature suggests, depend on other beings to help them sustain their life force. In exchange for this relationship, the symbiote offers great powers to its host. Unfortunately for the host, the symbiotes are often not keen on the idea of separating and eventually start to fully consume both mind and body of their hosts. Removal of the symbiote is often only possible through the usage of strong sound waves produced from intensely loud and sustained noises.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The idea for Venom came from Randy Schueller, a reader, and was bought by Marvel for $220 under the direction of then editor in chief <a href=\"../../jim-shooter/26-40450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Shooter</a>. The designs for the costume and character came from <a href=\"../../mike-zeck/26-7764/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mike Zeck</a> and <a href=\"../../todd-mcfarlane/26-3380/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Todd McFarlane</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The symbiote itself is sentient and has chosen different hosts through the years.

The host now is <a href=\"../../flash-thompson/29-1489/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flash Thompson</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>When the <a href=\"../../beyonder/29-10300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beyonder</a> created <a href=\"../../battleworld/34-51065/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Battleworld</a> in the events of the comic \"Secret Wars 1\", the crime fighter known as Spider-Man released the <a href=\"../../symbiotes/65-56880/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Symbiote</a> when his familiar red and blue costume was ripped into tatters, believing it to be an alien clothing generator. When Spider-Man grabbed the little black ball, it instantly slithered over his body, covering him from head to toe. But it did not pattern itself after his red-and-blue costume. Rather, it took on the appearance of the garment worn by Julia Carpenter, the new <a href=\"/julia-carpenter/29-16197/\">Spider-Woman</a>, whom Spider-Man had been admiring. The webslinger was amazed at the properties of his new suit, but never questioned the mechanisms behind them. For instance, it could mimic any type of clothing whatsoever, making Spider-Man\u2019s need for spare clothing obsolete. It also contained a \"dimensional aperture\" where he could place his camera, spare change, and other items without adding to bulk of the costume. The costume was also capable of generating its own organic webbing. When the other super heroes that where with him used the machine, there clothes did not give/add any new powers to them. Once Spider-Man returned to Earth, the alien costume could not tolerate being separated from its host for long periods of time. At night, when Spider-Man\u2019s alter ego, Peter Parker, slept, the Symbiote would take control of him and battle evil. Peter realized that when he always wake up from bed, he is still exhausted. Later, Spider-Man battled the <a href=\"../../puma/29-15238/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Puma</a>, who perceived that the wall-crawler\u2019s webs were organic. Startled by this revelation, Spider-Man accepted <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reed Richards</a>' offer to study the costume. Richards learned that the costume was actually a living alien Symbiote, a parasite trying to graft itself permanently to Spider-Man both mentally and physically. Richards succeeded in separating the alien costume from its host by shooting it with a \"sonic blaster.\" He then contained the being in a special environmental cell. But the alien was much more intelligent than anyone perceived. It tried to hypnotize <a href=\"../../franklin-richards/29-2469/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Franklin Richards</a>, but failed unfortunately not stopping it. It escaped from its cell and made its way to Peter Parker\u2019s closet where it waited, disguised as a spare red-and-blue costume. Spider-Man unwittingly donned the costume, which immediately made itself apparent. He brought it to the tower at Our Lady of Saints Church gambling the intense sound of its bells would destroy it. Spider-Man lost the gamble, and he succumbed to the bells before the costume did. However, the empathic parasite had preyed upon the emotions of Spider-Man long enough to learn how to feel, and in feeling, to act. Sacrificing itself, the alien costume saved Spider-Man, who assumed it then, crawled away to die. Actually, the Symbiote, weak and dying, slithered down into the church where Eddie Brock knelled in prayer at the altar. Raised a Catholic, he begged forgiveness for the suicide he was contemplating.</p><h3>Eddie Brock</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"955374\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51464/955374-venom_super.jpg\" title=\"Eddie Brock as Venom\"><img id=\"955374\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51464/955374-venom_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Brock as Venom\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Eddie Brock as Venom</div></div></div></div><p>Eddie Brock had been a successful columnist for the newly revived <a href=\"../../daily-globe/65-56979/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daily Globe</a> until he began writing a series of articles about the \" <a href=\"../../sin-eater/29-11206/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sin-Eater</a> murders\". A bogus offender had confessed to Brock about committing the murders. While protecting the murderer\u2019s identity under the First Amendment, Brock wrote a series of stories in the Globe detailing his dialogue with the supposed killer, until mounting pressure from the authorities forced him to write an exclusive revealing the murderer's name. Although that edition of the paper sold out immediately, Spider-Man soon revealed the true identity of the Sin-Eater to be Detective <a href=\"../../sin-eater/29-11206/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stan Carter</a>, making Brock a laughingstock among his fellow journalists. Fired from the Daily Globe, he was forced to write venomous drivel for scandal newspapers. Brock's wife left him, and his future appeared to be over. Brock blamed his predicament on Spider-Man.</p><p>Soon after, Brock began an intense physical workout program hoping to reduce the stress his life had become. However, such physical exertions only increased his violent obsession with Spider-Man. Although his body had been honed to near-perfection, Brock\u2019s mind was reduced to an all-consuming vessel of hatred. It was this fierce emotion that attracted the empathic parasite. In order to survive, the alien costume had to feed off the nearest and greatest source of emotion. The Symbiote joined mentally and physically with Brock, whose emotions overwhelmed the already confused alien. The dominant thought on both their minds was that of Spider-Man. But Brock\u2019s sheer hatred for the crime fighter twisted the Symbiote\u2019s feelings to a similar extent. In effect, Brock\u2019s emotions drove the Symbiote insane, just as their bonding may have driven Brock over the edge. Brock soon discovered that the costume gave him all the powers of Spider-Man, and more. It also added bulk to his already large frame and increased his strength to superhuman levels. Calling himself \" Venom,\" Brock directed the costume to sprout a hideous grin and plotted his revenge. Through the costume, Venom learned a great deal about Spider-Man, including his secret identity.</p><p>Brock taunted Peter Parker with minor assaults, such as pushing him in front of a moving subway train. The alien costume could cancel out the wall-crawler\u2019s spider-sense presumably by projecting conflicting frequencies upon Spider-Man's brain waves. Venom finally made a bold move when he confronted Parker\u2019s wife, Mary Jane, at their old Chelsea apartment. Although Venom\u2019s twisted sense of morality did not allow him to physically harm Mary Jane, Spider-Man immediately realized the nature of this threat. Taking the time to retrieve the sonic blaster from the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man challenged Venom at Our Lady of Saints Church. Although he fired the blaster at Venom, Spider-Man soon discovered that the Symbiote could not be separated from Brock because it had completely bonded with him. Trying to escape and rethink his options, Spider-Man was caught unaware by Venom. He captured Spider-Man and secured him to the inside of the church bell with a considerable amount of webbing. Spider-Man narrowly escaped the bell\u2019s crushing clapper before defeating Venom by forcing him to deplete his webbing supply, of</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"665250\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/665250-035_super.jpg\" title=\"Eddie Brock &amp; the Venom Symbiote Contained\"><img id=\"665250\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/665250-035_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Eddie Brock &amp; the Venom Symbiote Contained\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Eddie Brock & the Venom Symbiote Contained</div></div></div></div><p>which the alien Symbiote was actually comprised. Before the alien could regenerate enough of its mass to become a renewed threat, Spider-Man brought Venom to the Fantastic Four who imprisoned him in a sonic containment cell. The Fantastic Four then shipped Venom to the government super-prison in the Colorado Rockies called the Vault. A young guard named Hugh Taylor who had just been assigned to the Vault was fooled into thinking that Venom was a fallen colleague and released the gate mechanism, which imprisoned the criminal. Venom killed the naive guard and escaped to <a href=\"../../new-york-city/34-41183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New York City</a>, where he once again confronted Spider-Man. This time Spider-Man used psychological warfare upon Venom, by taunting the alien Symbiote to return to him. The alien, torn by its love-hate relationship for Spider-Man, tried to leave Brock and to re-establish its link with its original owner. But the trauma of trying to detach itself from Brock\u2019s nervous system was too much to bear. The alien costume and Eddie Brock were both knocked unconscious and were subsequently returned to the Vault, where they were incarcerated. Since then, Venom has gone through many changes.</p><p>The next fight, Venom went after Spider-Man around the same time <a>Jonathon Caesar</a>, an insane and obsessed fan of Mary Jane Watson-Parker, sent two mercenaries <a>Styx</a> and <a>Stone</a> after the wallcrawler. Venom unintentionally became involved in the plot when the two attempted to follow him through the sewers in the hope of finding Spider-Man. Unfortunately for them, Venom escaped the sewers in his human guise. After yet another fight with Spider-Man, Styx and Stone found the two and attempted to kill Spider-Man. Fortunately for Spidey, albeit in a bad way, Venom would not allow anyone else to kill Spider-Man, save himself. Attacking the two, the fight ensued, before Styx, the living cancer, touched his Symbiote, killing it in the process. With the Symbiote seemingly dead, Eddie Brock was sent to a normal prison. However, later, it was revealed the Symbiote was merely sent into a comatose state, seemingly immune to Earthly diseases. Returning to Eddie Brock, the two easily escaped. In the breakout, however, the suit left a small spawn behind it, which would bond with Eddie's cell mate, <a href=\"../../carnage/29-1490/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cletus Kasady</a>. No one would know about this for months. Eddie brought Spider-Man to an island in the Caribbean, away from people and innocents, in the hope of killing him alone. However, Spider-Man later realized that Venom would only be happy if he knew that Spider-Man was dead. Faking his death, Spider-Man made Venom believe that he had died. Happy at last, Venom thought there was no reason to return to civilization, having all he needed on the island, and stayed there.</p><p>A few months later, however, the psychotic serial killer, known only as <a href=\"../../carnage/29-1490/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnage</a> emerged, beginning slaughter spree throughout <a href=\"../../new-york-city/34-41183/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Manhattan</a>, in which hundreds died. Spider-Man attempted to stop him, but learnt the hard way that he was outmatched physically, despite his superior experience. Realizing that Carnage</p><p>possessed a Symbiote, Peter reluctantly turned to Venom for assistance in order to stop this menace. Contacting the <a href=\"../../human-torch/29-2120/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Human Torch</a>, they traveled to the island where Spider-Man had left Venom. When Venom saw that Spider-Man was in fact still alive, he attacked the two. A brief spat ensued, after which Venom listened to what Spider-Man's reasoning. Venom agreed to help Spider-Man stop Carnage in exchange for his freedom, Spider-Man reluctantly obliged, starting the first of many uneasy alliances with between the two.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"501993\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom_super.jpg\" title=\"Carnage, Spider-Man, and Venom\"><img id=\"501993\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/501993-063_lrg_carnge_spidey_venom_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Carnage, Spider-Man, and Venom\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Carnage, Spider-Man, and Venom</div></div></div></div><p>Once they returned to New York, Venom and Spider-Man combined efforts to stop Carnage's rampage on two separate occasions with equal failure.

Jonah Jameson.</a></p><p>After Spider-Man destroyed Kasady's Carnage symbiote through the use of stage's sound system, Venom attacked him. He still possessed enough hatred to attempt to choke him. Luckily, Venom was stopped b y the Fantastic Four. After years of combat, Venom reached an agreement with Spider-Man and made a truce.</p><h3><b>Lethal Protector</b></h3><p>After forming a truce with Spider-Man, Venom would relocate to the West Coast, <a href=\"../../san-francisco/34-55704/\" rel=\"nofollow\">San Francisco</a>. Starting out as a \" <a href=\"../../lethal-protector/39-56075/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lethal Protector</a>\", Venom would come across a hidden underground city. A man known as <a>Roland Treece</a> was sending hired guns to exterminate these people so he could claim the hidden gold reserve below the underground city. Venom decided to protect these people from Treece and infiltrated Treece's company. Venom's actions had gotten Spider-Man's attention, however, and Spider-Man would travel to San Francisco to bring Venom down once and for all. While Spidey searched for a lead on his former enemy, Venom was being pursued by a team of of highly trained soldiers known as the Jury. <a>The Jury</a> was brought together by <a>Orwell Taylor</a>, the father of the young Vault officer Venom killed during a Vault breakout. The Jury relentlessly attacked Venom, nearly killing him until <a>the Life Foundation</a> rescued, then captured, him. <a>Carlton Drake</a>, head of the foundation had plans for creating super guardsman similar to Venom's first offspring, Carnage, and violently ripped from Venom five spawn, creating the Five <a>Life Foundation Symbiotes</a> and joining them with their best personnel. Spider-Man encountered one of the new symbiotes, a female human joined with a symbiote, and followed her back to the Life Foundation. Realizing that Spider-Man's intrusion was in order to track down Venom, and since Venom was no longer useful for the foundation, Drake had the symbiote violently separated from Eddie, nearing killing Eddie.</p><p>Eddie would later free himself and team-up with Spider-Man, reuniting with his own Venom symbiote. The five new symbiote tested out their powers against the combined efforts of Spider-Man and Venom, but their symbiotes where seemingly destroyed by a machine triggered by Venom, and the human host where thought dead after the Life Foundation complex self-destructed. Having escaped the exploding building, the two spider-powered foes would join forces against Roland Treece and prevent him from killing all of the inhabitants of the underground city. Spider-Man then returned to New York while Venom would remain with the underground city.</p><h3><b>Maximum Carnage</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"151823\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5361/151823-77821-maximum-carnage_super.jpg\" title=\"Maximum Carnage\"><img id=\"151823\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5361/151823-77821-maximum-carnage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Maximum Carnage\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Maximum Carnage</div></div></div></div><p>Carnage would later escape again and be joined up with other super villains and start the <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage</a>.

After being separated from his own symbiote by the <a>Scarlet Spider</a>, Eddie Brock was sent to a research facility. The five Life Foundation Symbiotes broke into the facility to escape with Eddie. They kept Eddie captive until he would agree to help the human hosts control their own symbiotes. But one of the five symbiotes, <a>Donna (Scream)</a> would kill off the human hosts of her fellow offspring one-by-one. When the Venom symbiote escaped from it's imprisonment and rejoined with Eddie, the two would defeat Scream and leave her and her four dead comrades (with their symbiotes still alive) for the authorities (the remaining four symbiotes would merge into one and bond with Scott Washington to become <a>Hybrid.</a></p><h3>The CIA</h3><p>Venom was recruited via an ultimatum by the government to be a special operations counter-terrorist agent. Venom agreed, but one stipulation of the deal did not sit too well with him. A bomb was planted in his chest to assure complete and utter obedience. After a few missions, Venom became tired of the situation and had the Symbiote perform surgery on him and extracted the bomb. A brouhaha ensued wherein the end result was Eddie Brock lying unconscious and the Symbiote dead, only to return later on and re-join with Eddie. Thus Venom was whole again and looking to square things with Spider-Man once again. He had lost his memory and no longer knew the secret identity of Spider-Man, but knew that a Venom blames Spider-Man for his wife's death deep seeded hatred resided within him for the webhead.</p><p>Shortly after the reunion, Venom joined the <a>Sinister Six</a> for a brief period in order to get at Spider-Man. After being scorned by the group, he hunted down certain members of the team for revenge (including <a>Electro</a>, the <a>Sandman</a>, and <a>Alyosha Kravinoff</a>). Later Eddie Brock approached his ex-wife Ann Weying, and at the thought of having the Symbiote back in her life, she jumped out of her apartment window and killed herself.</p><p>Venom blamed Spider-Man, whom he had a skirmish with right before Ann died.

After seeing a spiritual movie, Eddie decided to sell his Symbiote off in an auction, swearing off his life of vigilantism. The winner of the auction was the the gang lord <a href=\"../../angelo-fortunato/29-6769/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don Fortunato</a>. He gave the Symbiote to his son, Angelo Fortunato, in hopes that Angelo would finally make a name for himself. But after a fight against Spider-Man that resulted in Angelo cowering away, the Symbiote eventually left Angelo to die in mid-air.</p><h3>Mac Gargan</h3><p>The Symbiote passed on to Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, and offered him additional powers. He agreed and Mac became the next host of the Venom Symbiote which he thought will give him the advantage he needs in defeating Spider-Man as well as being apart of the <a href=\"../../sinister-twelve/65-40481/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinister Twelve</a>. But he was still defeated by Spider-Man with the help of other heroes. Even though he was incarcerated, it didn't hinder him as with his new powers he would be respected more as a powerful villain. He was later abducted by the Beyonder to participate yet again in another Secret War, but it was really the <a href=\"../../stranger/29-13332/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stranger</a> in disguise.

It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Symbiote in check. As a Thunderbolt, he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures. Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with <a href=\"../../jack-flag/29-25687/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Flag</a>, after pummeling Flag for a bit, the hero manages to stab Gargan, who is protected by his Symbiote. Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously manhandles <a href=\"../../jack-flag/29-25687/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flag</a>, and is about to feast upon his flesh, when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him, allowing Flag to live. Gargan expresses fear of the control the Symbiote possesses over him, yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him, and cannot begin to imagine life without it, similarly to a drug addict. Later, during an attack from <a href=\"../../steel-spider/29-18429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steel Spider</a>, <a href=\"../../american-eagle/29-41819/\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Eagle</a> and <a href=\"../../shadowoman/29-42522/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sepulchre</a>, Gargan loses control again, briefly becoming a huge monster once more, while <a href=\"../../moonstone/29-3279/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moonstone</a> is incapacitated and thus cannot co-ordinate control of his electrical implants. Afterward, however, he returns to a normal form with no ill effects. Then, he bites off, and devours, Steel Spider's arm during a fight. Later, the Thunderbolts goes after Spider-Man for being an unregistered hero and like everyone else, he has no memory of Spider-Man's true identity, because of <a href=\"../../one-more-day/39-49939/\" rel=\"nofollow\">One More Day</a>. When Venom and Spider-Man fought, Eddie Brock got into the skirmish and the Symbiote suddenly left Gargan to bond again to Brock, but his skin acted like a corrosive when the Symbiote tried to attached itself. White substance began to appear from Brock's pores and became Anti-Venom. <a href=\"../../eddie-brock/29-6733/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Venom</a> battled Venom and seemingly \"cleansed\" Gargan of the Symbiote but also inadvertently cleansing Spider-Man remaining Symbiote within his body along with his spider powers. Venom appeared again to battle Anti-Venom, but this time he is wearing a scorpion armor to protect the recovering Symbiote. When Gargan was able to stabbed his stinger to Anti-Venom, the wound seemingly killed the Anti-Venom Symbiote and just as he was about to kill him, the Venom Symbiote stopped Gargan and said that it still had feelings for Brock and that he should live. Gargan vowed to kill Brock when he gets a chance, and Brock says the same.</p><h3><b>Secret Invasion</b></h3><p>After returning from another mission (it ended abruptly when Venom ate the target) the Thunderbolts were attacked by <a href=\"../../captain-marvel/29-1472/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Marvel</a> during <a href=\"../../secret-invasion/39-47264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Invasion</a>. When Venom tried to stop him he was sent flying through a window and below <a href=\"../../thunderbolts-mountain/34-53342/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thunderbolts Mountain</a>. It was later on discovered that <a href=\"../../captain-marvel/29-1472/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain Marvel</a> was a <a href=\"../../skrulls/65-40668/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Skrull.</a> Nobody knew what was happening except for <a href=\"../../norman-osborn/29-58812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Norman Osborn</a>. Earth was at war. The Thunderbolts had been sent to protect Washington. When they arrived, Venom thrived in battle, eating as many Skrulls as he could. Later on he was attacked by a <a href=\"../../super-skrulls/65-57545/\" rel=\"nofollow\">super Skrull</a>, and they were both sent flying off they ship that they were on. They both landed among a crowd, and the Skrull quickly changed its shape. Venom, knowing it was hiding then began suffocating people in the crowd with tendrils, trying to find it. When Osborn saw this he reminded the Symbiote that while he was all for letting it fulfill its urges, there did have to be guidelines. Venom then continued to do what he was doing before. The Skrull saw all of this and, while changing back into its battle form, called Venom a monster saying that humans would liberate the Skrulls after seeing this. Venom then revealed that it was an act, and that the people had been able to breath the entire time. He said he did this to make the Skrull come out of hiding. Venom then proceeded to attack the Skrull. He badly wounded it with his claws and then started eating it. After Washington, the Thunderbolts continued on to New York, where <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man</a> had summoned all the heroes for a final battle against the Skrulls in Central Park. When they arrived, Osborn reminded the Thunderbolts that Skrulls were the target. Venom began to complain, saying that Spider-Man was nearby. He was quickly made quiet. Throughout the battle , Venom continued to kill and eat Skrulls, and was only seen harmed once when he was punched by a Skrull taking on the persona of <a href=\"../../hank-pym/29-2247/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giant Man</a>. Venom and the rest of the Thunderbolts made it through the Secret Invasion unharmed, excluding the death of <a href=\"../../andreas-strucker/29-4815/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swordsman</a>'s <a href=\"../../andrea-strucker/29-4814/\" rel=\"nofollow\">sister</a>.</p><h3><b>Dark Reign: The Sinister Spider-Man</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"748480\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/748480-743427_mac_spider_man_super.jpg\" title=\"Sinister Spider-Man\"><img id=\"748480\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/748480-743427_mac_spider_man_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Sinister Spider-Man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sinister Spider-Man</div></div></div></div><p>When Norman Osborn became head of the superhero community, he formed a new team of <a href=\"../../avengers/65-3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a> called the <a href=\"../../dark-avengers/65-55990/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dark Avengers</a>, where he recruits Venom to be on the team.

Ares and Venom are seen facing a front line of Asguardians while Moonstone and <a href=\"../../norman-osborn/29-58812/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Patriot</a> are confronted by Thor. Osborn calls on the <a href=\"../../sentry/29-1454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentry</a> to ambush Thor, and he continues to attack Thor from behind.</p><p>Later the real Avengers interfere in the battle and attack Osborn and his troops. Venom is still seen battling and eating Asgardians; Mac knows that Osborn has taken it too far this time and that they will eventually lose but he plans to enjoy it to the very end. As he is consuming Asgardians and stating that they are the Kobe Beef of People, he is interrupted by Spider-man. They fight and Spider-Man almost loses the battle, but Ms. Marvel suddenly arrives on the battlefield and pulls Mac Gargan out of the symbiote. Venom decides to re-assemble with Ms. Marvel; it manages to fully suppress Ms. Marvel and took the full control of her body, but not her mind. Even so, Venom was able to read her brain like an opened book and discovered that Carol has an affection to Peter Parker. Spider-Man tried to use a bell from the church tower but suddenly found out that the bell was removed. Ms. Marvel tried to separate herself from the black suit and told Spider-Man that she needs a powerful energy charge to overcome the symbiote. Spider-Man knocked Venom onto wires and the electricity disconnected Carol from the black suit. Then it came back to it's previous host - Mac Gargan - and tried to attack heroes once more, but Spider-Man webbed Venom's legs and threw him in the air so Ms. Marvel could beat him with car bumper. That's how Venom was sent to a long flight and then crushed into the flying aircraft (probably the A.I.M. one). That was enough to stop him for now. Carol and Spidey decided to come back to the battlefield set up on the ruins of Asgard. Later before the Sentry destroyed Asgard's Venom is seen battling opponents switching from his monstrous size to his Spider-Man size. After the destruction of Asgard by the Void it is unknown what happens to Venom. After <a>the Void</a> is defeated, Mac/Venom are seen captured along with the rest of the Dark Avengers (except Daken). As Siege ends it is speculated that Venom/Mac is sent to jail to pay for his crimes.</p><h3><b>Heroic Age</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1671909\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1671909-venom003_cvr_col_super.jpg\" title=\"I'm Back!\"><img id=\"1671909\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/1671909-venom003_cvr_col_medium.jpg\" alt=\"I'm Back!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">I'm Back!</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../mac-gargan/29-4484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mac Gargan</a> and Venom are taken into The Raft after they are captured during <a href=\"../../siege/39-55985/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siege</a>. Scientists at The <a href=\"../../the-raft/34-50736/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Raft</a> speculate about why the symbiote is always left attached to the host when it is taken into custody, and they proceed to separate Gargan from Venom. With <a href=\"../../flash-thompson/29-1489/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flash Thompson</a> as the new Venom, he has began to work for his country once again. Most know that Flash lost his legs in war years ago and that he left the Military. Now, Flash has chose to serve his country again and become Venom. Trying to remove all of the tension between Venom and him being the greatest enemy of <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, Flash has been given drugs to control the evil Symbiote and the demon within himself. However the Symbiote is smarter than most seem to think and has already been able to, temporarily, break control of Flash's control. Without letting his dispatch know, because they will kill Flash and Venom at the same time, Flash is still trying to become a hero that his hero (Spider-Man) will want to have a good friendship with. And maybe even a partnership.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Symbiotes empower the natural abilities of a host to the point where they far exceed that of normal members of the hosts' species. These abilities include the following superhuman strength, speed and agility, Super enhanced durability, resistance to damage and healing ability, genetic memory, recalling information from previous hosts. Can expand to any size as long as they have something to grow on such as a host or an object. Symbiotes can get inside of small areas such as electric wires and the insides of cars and completely disable them. The Symbiote also reacts to the thoughts and will of the host. When Spider-Man was originally selected, he had been thinking about Arachne's costume. The Symbiote acted on this and formed a similar costume, the one seen on him and Venom. The Symbiote can sense the presence of other Symbiote within a certain distance and the ability to shape-shift, from mimicking clothing up to and including complete change of appearance and stature.</p><p>The Venom Symbiote has also adapted the spider powers from Spider-Man and has been inherited by its offspring such as the ability to cling on walls and produce an infinite amount of webbing from its own mass and the ability to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense. at his peak before contacting the symbiote he can lift (press) 700 lbs and As Venom Brock's strength allows him to lift (press) 25 tons , stronger than Spider-Man himself (Before having the Anti-Venom Symbiote to lift 100 tons). Gargan can lift twice than Spider-Man he originally lift(press) 25 tons. The natural super-strength of Gargan combined with the strength of the symbiote allows him to lift(press) over 100 tons. The Symbiote allows the user limited shape-shifting. Norman provided Gargan a medicine that allows the symbiote to return to it's original form to mimic Spider-Man's appearance. The medicine must be taken in between periods of times, or else the symbiote would take over Gargan. Gargan has the ability to switch between the Venom appearance and the smaller Spider-Man appearance.</p><p>Additionally, the symbiote is capable of healing injuries in the host at a faster rate than normal human healing allows. The symbiote is also capable of healing injuries and illnesses that current human medical care cannot such as cancer.</p><h2>Weaknesses</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1037196\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/1037196-eddie_brock_naked___hyeeaaagh__super.jpg\" title=\"Symbiotes are highly vulnerable to sonic blasts.\"><img id=\"1037196\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/1037196-eddie_brock_naked___hyeeaaagh__medium.jpg\" alt=\"Symbiotes are highly vulnerable to sonic blasts.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Symbiotes are highly vulnerable to sonic blasts.</div></div></div></div><p>The Venom symbiote, like almost all symbiotes, is highly vulnerable to sonics and intense heat.

Jonah Jameson was born to David and Betty Jameson. His father was a United States Army officer and a veteran war hero. But David Jameson was an abusive man and would regularly beat his wife and son, which caused Jonah to grow up convinced that even heroes could be and indeed were evil. During high school Jonah was active in boxing and photography. When he joined the photography club he met Joan, who would eventually become his wife. When some bullies began bullying Jonah, he fought back and beat all of them. Joan was impressed and the two of them started dating soon after. They would marry after high school. <br /></p><h2>Creation<br /></h2><p>J. Jonah Jameson was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, and first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1. It has been said that J. Jonah Jameson was partially based upon how Stan Lee thought that his readers would perceive him- indeed, the first panel which he appears in has him hunched over a typewriter, typing frantically. <br /></p><h2>Character Evolution<br /></h2><p>Although Jonah at first appeared to simply be a one-dimensional, raving tycoon with a grudge against Spider-Man, he has evolved over the years to show that he has a kind side too (notably towards his employees when he was in charge of the Daily Bugle, whom he would often side with and support), and that he has a myriad of deep, and arguably rational, reasons for his dislike and hatred of Spider-Man. <br /></p><h3>Why he \"hates\" Spider-Man</h3><p>Jameson is always thwarted, \nembarrassed, and frustrated by Spider-Man. He hates the \"costumed \nfreaks\" more than he's ever hated anyone before. He'll never be \ncontented while he's free. The history behind Jonah's hate for costumed \nvigilantes lies in his past. When Jonah was still a young boy, he saw \nsomeone close to him get killed by an armed robber whom whore a mask. \nFrom that day on, Jonah vowed to make the world a safer place to help \nand bring these vigilantes to justice. <br /><br /></p><h2>Major Story Arcs<br /></h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"411132\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/22968/411132-bugle1_super.png\" title=\"The Daily Bugle\"><img id=\"411132\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/22968/411132-bugle1_medium.png\" alt=\"The Daily Bugle\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Daily Bugle</div></div></div></div><p>Jonah became a journalist after he graduated from school. He found his first job at the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">       Daily Bugle</a>. During his time as a journalist he met the original Human Torch, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jim-hammond/29-12605/\">       Jim Hammond</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">       Namor</a> MacKenzie, the Sub-Mariner, for the first time. Jameson, skeptical of both of them, refused to trust anyone whom he was convinced operated outside the law. During World War II, he went to Europe to cover the war.</p><p>After World War II, Jonah and Joan had a son, whom they named John. When the Korean War started, Jonah went out on the field to cover that war also. Eventually returning home, Jonah discovered that his wife had been killed by a mugger. Jonah became obsessed with his work in hopes of forgetting the pain the loss of his wife caused. Jonah worked so hard that he was eventually promoted to Chief Editor of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">       Daily Bugle</a>. During his time as a reporter, Jonah had contributed in helping to bring down organized crime, and also supported civil rights.</p><h3>The War Against Spider-Man</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">       Spider-Man</a> came to town when Jameson\u2019s son <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-jameson/29-4456/\">       John</a> became a great astronaut. The media were all over Spider-Man, but Jameson had a far different--and much more evil--plan. Since he had never trusted heroes to begin with, and since Spider-Man was taking all of the press away from his son, Jameson would try and expose Spider-Man as a criminal. Even on an occasion when Spider-Man saved John\u2019s life, Jameson instead accused Spider-Man of having falsified the whole event that had plunged John's life into danger in the first place.</p><p>Jameson's and Spider-Man\u2019s relationship existed this way for a long time. Jameson\u2019s anger only grew with time because he was convinced that no hero ever stayed a hero indefinitely. He would print countless articles attempting to prove that Spider-Man was a criminal. However, he always ended up having to print retraction articles soon after when Spider-Man again proved him wrong. Due to David Jameson\u2019s abuse, Jonah Jameson would stay convinced that every hero always had a hidden agenda and that all their agendas were always against the law.</p><h3>The Spider-Slayers<br /></h3><p>Jameson would always post rewards for anyone who would capture Spider-Man or uncover his true identity, and he even went so far as to work with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spencer-smythe/29-17632/\">       Spencer Smythe</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-slayer/29-15512/\">       Spider-Slayer</a> in trying to capture Spider-Man. Jameson hired <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mac-gargan/29-4484/\">       Mac Garga</a>n to test out a genetic enhancement which transformed Gargan into the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scorpion/29-4484/\">       Scorpion</a> because a scorpion was the spider\u2019s main enemy (the Scorpion had incredible powers, but a side affect was insanity). The Scorpion instead tried to kill Jameson for what he had done to him, only to be stopped by Spider-Man. Eventually Jameson hired <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silver-sable/29-7608/\">       Silver Sable</a> to try and capture Spider-Man.</p><h3>Green Goblin<br /></h3><p>As the first <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">       Green Goblin</a> terrorized the world, JJJ used his paper to campaign against it. Meanwhile, Jameson was attending parties and becoming a friend to Norman Osborn through such social hangouts as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/century-club/65-58334/\">       Century Club</a>, not knowing that the pumpkin wielding menace and leader of Oscorp were one and the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, a former criminal known as Fredrick Foswell began to do detective work by pretending to be a criminal named Patch and then publishing illegal activities in the Daily Bugle. Jameson was delighted with Foswell's work. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\">       Kraven</a> came to New York, Jameson was fascinated and planned to have his papers praise the bold hunter. When animals escaped and Kraven stopped them, Jameson became enthralled by the Russian superstar, unaware that Kraven had released the animals on purpose for fun and publicity. JJJ supported Kraven's quest to defeat Spiderman, but disapproved when Kraven mentioned slaying the webslinger, saying he only wanted Spidey to be brought to justice. He was shocked to learn that Kraven was really a crook.</p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">       Kingpin</a> first began to get the city in his grasp, Jameson began to use his papers to fight back and reveal him. Meanwhile, Spiderman became so tired of Jameson's campaign against him that he quit. At first, Jameson was delighted, especially when he found Spidey's abandoned costume. He even had the red and blue suit framed in his office. However, when Kingpin captured and began to kill him, he began to wish Spiderman was still around. In fact, Spiderman did return (taking the costume right out of JJJ's office), but was still overpowered by the Kingpin. The two were chained together and were nearly executed, but they escaped. Even so, Fredrick Foswell had to die to save Jonah. Jameson blamed Spiderman for everything, but showed Foswell as the hero he was in the <a href=\"/daily-bugle/65-40822/\">       Daily Bugle</a> the following day.</p><p>Later Jameson hired Dr. Marla Madison to create new Spider-Slayers because Spider-Man had destroyed all the previous ones and Spencer Smythe, who had created them, was now one of Jameson's enemies. Madison became interested with the challenge Spider-Man brought and kept working with Jameson. Eventually the two married, making her Jonah\u2019s second wife. They adopted <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mattie-franklin/29-41988/\">       Mattie Franklin</a> soon after. When Jameson discovered Osborn was the Green Goblin, he took it as a personal insult.</p><h3>Blackmailed<br /></h3><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hobgoblin/29-7605/\">       Hobgoblin</a> later blackmailed Jameson with the information that Jameson had commissioned the creation of the criminal known as the Scorpion. Unbeknownst to Jameson, the Hobgoblin was secretly fellow <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/century-club/65-58334/\">       Century Club</a> member, Roderick Kingsley. Not wishing to be blackmailed, Jameson instead revealed his role in having created the Scorpion to the general public. Jameson then stepped down as Chief Editor and gave the job to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-robertson/29-1782/\">       Robbie Robertson</a>. It was the Hobgoblin's blackmailing that caused Jameson to put <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ned-leeds/29-12354/\">       Ned Leeds</a> on the Hobgoblin story, in hopes of finding out just who he was, which in turn caused Leeds' own downfall. <br /></p><h3>Losing the Bugle to Norman Osborn<br /></h3>When Norman Osborn seemed to have returned from the dead, he soon bought out Jameson as owner of his newspaper, the Daily Bugle. Norman told eveybody he had been spending the time in Europe and that he was not really the Green Goblin. Now Jonah and Norman where both owners of the paper. It shocked Jonah's employees to see him act like a puppy whenever Norman Osborn was around. This however, had a very profound reason. Norman Osborn threatened to heart Jonah's loved ones if he would so much as abstruct him in any way. Eventually the ruse got out that Norman was in fact the Green Goblin. He was put in a mental-hospital and Jonah regained the rights as owner of the Daily Bugle once again. <br /><h3>Civil War</h3><p>When Spider-Man revealed to the world that he was Peter Parker, Jameson was crushed. He had always believed Parker to be an honest kid, whom he loved like a son. He loved the fact that Parker would ignore Jameson\u2019s rudeness and still bring photo after photo to him. Jameson thought he had a bond of trust with Parker, but after Parker revealed himself to be Spider-Man, that bond was shattered. Jameson believed that Parker kept working at the Bugle to gain a laugh at Jameson for being so stupid as not to realize that he was Spider-Man. Jameson became so hateful of Parker as to want to ruin him, even though Parker had sided with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">       Super-Human Registration Act</a>. Jameson tried to sue Parker for fraud for all the photos he had taken of himself as Spider-Man, but the government gave Parker immunity to these charges because of all his good deeds and because he was a registered hero.</p><p>Jameson\u2019s son John later married attorney Jennifer Walters, the crusading adventuress known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">       She-Hulk</a>. This angered Jameson even more, and he even sent a Spider-Slayer to attack the She-Hulk. The She-Hulk instead defeated it easily and tried to work things out with Jameson. As Jennifer Walters, she offered to take the case to prove Spider-Man was a fraud, but she later told John that all she really intended to do was drag the case out for a long time to make Jameson mad.</p><p>When Spider-Man went rogue from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">       Captain America</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">       Secret Avengers</a>, Jameson posted another reward to bring Spider-Man in. Later it was revealed that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/betty-brant/29-2484/\">       Betty Brant</a> had been secretly giving information to a rival paper about libel reports on Parker. Still feeling anger on Peter's alleged betrayal, Jonah fired Robbie. When Betty told this to Peter, he webbed Jonah's office and left a note saying that they have to talk that has been long overdue. When they met, Spider-Man tried to persuade Jonah to get Robbie his job back, but he ask him to make a choice between his lawsuit against him or Robbie's job. Then Spider-Man ask Jonah to him to release him frustrations to him which he reluctantly did. Spider-Man then used his insults and wise-cracks on Jonah that made him even angrier to the point that he broke his hand because of so much hitting. Spider-Man they gave him a film containing picture of Jonah's assault on him and told Jonah that the pictures will sell a gazillion copies. Jonah came back to the Bugle and destroyed the film by stomping it and left the Bugle. He was accidentally hit by Betty by the door that resulted in him getting two black eyes. He then goes to Robbie's home and told what happened to him and said that he can have his job back and he dropped the charges on Spider-Man. He later become skeptical on Spider-Man's true identity when the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-spiders/65-44648/\">       Scarlet Spiders</a> \"unmasked\" themselves as Peter Parker, stating that Peter was always have been in their team but was let go because of attitude problem.</p><h3>Brand New Day</h3><p>After \"One More Day,\" the event where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mephisto/29-2635/\">       Mephisto</a> rewrites Peter's history to save his Aunt May's life, no one remembers Spider-Man's true identity, including Jonah. Jonah was facing a buyout since Peter has not been taking pictures of Spider-Man and the departure of his best reporter, Ben Urich. When Peter confronted him about his delayed paycheck, both him and Jonah had a war of words where Parker said that he had made JJJ. Jonah then had a heart attack. With the editor-in-chief incapacitated, his wife sold off the Bugle to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dexter-bennett/29-50434/\">       Dexter Bennett</a>. He returned to Bugle and again suffered another heart attack when he discovered that the Bugle was sold off. He attempted going out into the middle of feet of snow in only a hospital nightgown to find and tell his mind to Bennet, but the hospital staff stopped him.</p><p>When he returned home, he was enraged at the wife (who had temporarily left), but had trouble expressing his anger due to the fear of another heart attack. However, as his physical situation improved, an interesting turn of events related to the terrorism and violence of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/menace/29-50406/\">       Menace</a>, the position of mayor became open, and Jameson took it. Jameson now hates Bennet even more than he hates Spider-Man. <br /></p><h3>Dark Reign<br /></h3><p>Meanwhile, Norman Osborn, who had quit being the Green Goblin, became in charge of the super community and replaced <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\">       SHIELD</a> with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammer/65-56065/\">       HAMMER</a>. Norman Osborn's Avengers (the so-called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dark-avengers/65-55990/\">       Dark Avengers</a>) had Venom masquerading as Spiderman on it (a fact Osborn was fully aware of). The current Venom was Mac Gargan, who blamed Jameson for giving him insanity that got him arrested back when he got his powers. After a stripper discovered Gargan's identity as Venom, Mac killed her and left her body in Jameson's bed to frame a murder. People began to suspect Jameson. Next, Mac used money gotten from selling stolen Iron Man suits as well as his position as an Avenger to start a gang war, causing crime to sky rocket. With Jameson's popularity plummeting, the former publisher turned to Osborn and begged him to have an Avenger work with him to fight crime, protect him, and (mostly) to boost publicity. Jameson wanted Ms. Marvel (really <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstone/29-3279/\">       Moonstone</a>), because she captivated people due to her provocative clothing and attractive looks. Osborn wanted a better influence (and something more public) with Mac to prevent Venom from continuing to compromise the Spider-man identity, so he told Osborn to accept the former Scorpion instead. Fearing for his position, a distraught Jameson felt forced to comply. Meanwhile, Venom plans to kill Jameson with this new position (Osborn was unaware Mac harbored a grudge towards JJJ). Macs plot is being threatened though because the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/redeemer/29-63143/\">       Redeemer</a> and his team are planning to get Venom removed from the Avengers. <br />&nbsp;<br />One of Jonah's first acts as Mayor was to create his own Anti Spider Squad, equipped with suits of <a href=\"/mandroid/29-13920/\">      Mandroid</a> armour, to hunt down Spider-Man. In response to this, Spider-Man ends up fighting crime and saving people around the clock to annoy Jameson, although when a fight with <a href=\"/vulture/29-69888/\">     the new Vulture</a> disturbs a baseball game, he ends up giving up this attempt. Jameson also later hires Peter Parker as his press photographer, after the latter is out of a job and seeking work. <br /></p><h3>The Gauntlet<br /></h3>During the events of <a href=\"/the-gauntlet/39-55984/\">    the Gauntlet</a>, the new Vulture, Jimmy Natale, starts attacking gangsters, as he recalls being mutated by them, and now seeks revenge for his new form. To protect themselves from him, the gangsters put out the word that Jameson created the Vulture, even though nothing could be further from the truth. With his memory somewhat fragmented, Jimmy wholeheartedly believes them, and goes after Jameson.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />Spider-Man and a security guard named Gabriel Graham end up saving Jameson from the Vulture, although Graham dies in the process. Spider-Man notices that Jameson is moved by this, and as the public is still sceptical as to whether he created the Vulture or not, creates a fake photo of Jameson fighting the Vulture to try and get the public on his side. Whilst this is successful, Jameson knows that the photo must be faked, and as a result, fires Peter Parker, since he can't stand false evidence or news. <br /><h3>Big Time<br /></h3>Still seeking revenge on Jameson for his father's death, <a href=\"/alistair-smythe/29-6292/\">  Alistaire Smythe</a> recruits the Scorpion, in addition to <a href=\"/army-of-insects/65-58079/\">   a team of insect-based supervillains</a>, to try and kill J. Jonah Jameson, whilst simultaneously destroying all of the things which he loves, such as his son, and the Daily Bugle. Fortunately, with the help of Spider-Man and the New Avengers none of this is successful, but tragically, Jonah's wife Marla dies saving Jonah from one of Alistaire's attacks.<br /><br /><h2><b>Characteristics</b></h2><p>Gender: Male</p><p>Height: 5'11''</p><p>Weight: 210 lbs</p><p>Eyes: Blue</p><p>Hair: Black</p><h2><b>Alternate Versions</b></h2><p><b>Marvel 1602 (Earth-311)</b></p><p>In the year 1602, Jameson is Irish colonist and is the publisher of the \"Daily Trumpet.\" He assigned Peter Parquagh to investigate the \"Spider\" as he thinks that he could be a threat to the colony.</p><p><b>Earth X (Earth-9997)</b></p><p>When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-bolt/29-4329/\">       Black Bolt</a> released the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/terrigen-mists/18-40921/\">       Terrigen Mists</a> into the earth's atmosphere, it gave all humans superpowers. Jameson was turned into a donkey, making him a \"jackass.\" Also Jameson revealed that Spider-Man is Peter Parker, which ruined his reputation.</p><p><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">       House of M</a> (Earth-58163)</b></p><p>In this reality where mutants are the majority, Jameson is the publicist of Peter Parker as Spider-Man, who is beloved as a superhero. When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-goblin/29-1484/\">       Green Goblin</a> (Peter Parker made the goblin out of his own guilt of not being a born mutant) gave Jameson Peter's journal which contains his confessions that he is actually a mutate. Jameson publicizes this but regretted it when Spider-Man appears to have committed suicide.</p><p><b>MC2 Universe (Earth-982)</b></p><p>In the near future, Jameson is still the publisher of the Daily Bugle, and the prime supporter of \"Project Human Fly.\" When the flight suit was stolen and the test pilot was killed, he thought that the thief was the one responsible. He didn't knew that the one who currently possess the suit is his grandson Jack Jameson aka <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-buzz/29-20114/\">       The Buzz</a>. He also hires Mayday Parker as his photographer, and in contrast with his feelings for Spider-Man in the past, he actually liked <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-girl/29-3365/\">       Spider-Girl</a> as a superhero.</p><p><b>Marvel Zombiverse (Earth-2149)</b></p><p>In this reality, Jameson was eaten by a zombified Spider-Man in his office.</p><p><b>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</b></p><p>Jameson is still the same character as in Earth-616 except that he is younger in this universe. He has hired Peter as the newspaper's webmaster.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p>Jameson has been a regular character in almost all adaptations of <i>Spider-Man</i>.</p><h4>Animation</h4><p>The 1960s animated series contained the most negative depiction of the character, voiced by Paul Kligman, as an egotistical, greedy, cowardly loudmouth who automatically accuses Spider-Man of any crime, even when the evidence clearly contradicts him. He is implied to have some physic ability in one episode where the Green Goblin tries using him as a medium for a demon-summoning. He is constantly against Spider Man, for example in 'Farewell Performance' he wants an old theatre to be torn down, but when Spider Man claims he agrees with old buildings being torn down, Jameson says the Daily Bugle will now try to preserve old buildings, which is what Spider Man wanted. He makes a feature for magic in his paper when he is sent free tickets by Blackwell the Magician, showing his meanness. In the Sting of the Scorpion he makes out that he saved the employees, despite cowering most of the time. In the second season, Jameson's attitude toward Spider Man warms a bit, even going as far as helping Spider-Man defeat the Kingpin and expose a phony medicine racket during their first meeting. Not openly hostile, Jameson seems to be more surprised that Spider Man actually exists. Earlier in the episode, Jameson gives Peter a job at the Bugle, sight unseen, when he remembers that Peter is the nephew of a murder victim. In the third season he goes back to blaming Spider-Man for crimes.</p><p>J. Jonah Jameson appeared in the 1981 <i>Spider-Man</i> series and <i>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</i>, voiced by William Woodson.</p><p>Subsequent depictions have portrayed the character as more reasonable in his beliefs of costumed superheroes, particularly in the 1990s animated series, in which he was voiced by Edward Asner (whose casting may have been inspired by Asner's well-known role as another fictional news editor, Lou Grant). In this series, Jameson's hatred of Spider-Man is based less on his powers and more to his wearing a mask; in this continuity, his wife was killed by a masked gunman.</p><p>The series also portrays his integrity as a journalist, refusing to cover up the truth even when it is in his best interests, and portrays his loyalty to those who work for him. Examples of the earlier include firing Eddie Brock when John Jameson confirms Spider-Man's version of who stole a mineral John and a fellow astronaut brought from the moon and publishing an article on chemical weapons being developed by OsCorp despite being one of its shareholders and board members on this series. He secretly hired attorney Matt Murdock to defend Peter Parker when Peter was framed by Richard Fisk and personally uncovered evidence exonerating Robbie when he was framed by Tombstone. Jameson's cigar-smoking trademark characteristic is not depicted in the more recent animated TV incarnations, due to the levels on censorship required on the cartoons.</p><p>Jameson appears in MTV's 2003 <i>Spider-Man</i> series, voiced by Keith Carradine. Here, Jameson is portrayed as extremely cheap, his hatred of Spider-Man only being evident in the show's series finale.</p><p>J. Jonah Jameson appears in <i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i>, voiced by Daran Norris. He tends to be boisterous and difficult to get along with, though Betty Brant seems unfazed by his bloviating. He turns down Peter Parker's request for a job, but steals his idea to take pictures of Spider Man. Here, Jameson sports a soul patch along with his trademark mustache. Although he considers Spider-Man a menace (if at least a photo-worthy one), he seems to be fond of Peter Parker. He suggests tomato juice to the boy to kill the stench of garbage on him after a photo shoot in a junkyard, and protects him from Rhino by bravely covering for him while he can escape. When he learns that Aunt May had a heart attack during the Sinister Six's attack on Broadway, he says he will tell Peter the news.</p><p>This incarnation of Jameson displays a level of hyperactivity not seen in any of his previous incarnations, as well as an obsession with time, punctuality, and deadlines, likely inspired by J.K. Simmons' popular film portrayal of the character. Aside from that, he is very sadistic towards Spider-Man. His hatred of Spider-Man begins in the episode \"The Uncertainty Principle\" when the <i>Bugle</i> story of Jonah's son John Jameson safely landing the space shuttle despite a broken heat shield is outsold by the <i>Daily Globe</i> story of the fight between Spider-Man and Green Goblin. He blames Spider-Man for the sudden profusion of costumed psychopaths like Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin, and the Rhino in New York City (though this assumption is actually proven correct in the episode \"The Invisible Hand\", when Tombstone reveals that at least some of the super-villains were specifically created to occupy Spider Man so that more ordinary criminals can continue their activities unhindered). At one point he calls for the headline \"Spider-Man: Threat or Menace?\" In season 2 his hatred of Spider-Man gets worse. After his son John Jameson is affected by spores that hitched a ride in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_%28comics%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">       symbiote</a> making him grow and having super strength and leaping tall bounds, Jonah convinces his son to be a superhero and take Spider-Man down. The spores then take over John's mind making him violent and aggressive. After Spider-Man gets rid of the spores with electricity, Jonah then witnesses his son craving the spores powers and he blames Spider-Man for destroying his son. When Venom reveals Peter Parker's identity to Spider-Man, Jonah hardly believes it although he still wants to make sure. At Valentines Day his wife, Joan, makes him go to an opera even though he doesn't want to. There (after making an excuse to his wife to leave the stage) he witnesses the battle of the crime lords, Tombstone, Doctor Octopus, and Silvermane (ironically, Jameson was just making an excuse to leave the opera). After Spider-Man stops them and reveals Tombstone as the Big Man of Crime, Jameson accuses Spider-Man of assaulting an outstanding citizen but Frederick Foswell dismisses this to him by whispering in his ear. Jameson angrily responds by saying \"Never mind.\" After Norman Osborn tests the Vault security by putting Spider-Man in there, Jameson gloats about it. After Spider-Man manages to escape the Vault, Jameson claims Spider-Man and all the villains are working together so they can raise his blood pressure.</p><h4>Parodies</h4><p>In <i>The Simpsons</i> episode \" Moe'N'a Lisa\", which aired on November 19, 2006, J.K. Simmons guest stars, playing a publisher resembling Jameson as played by Simmons himself in the Spider-Man movies. This resemblance is made more apparent when he demands pictures, stories, and even poems about Spider-Man. He even repeats a line from <i>Spider-Man 3</i>: \"What are you waiting for? Chinese New Year?\" This is due in part to guest star Michael Chabon's script work on <i>Spider-Man 2</i>.The character also reappeared, with a different appearance, in an episode \" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homerazzi\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Homerazzi</a>\" later that season. He had also said \"I want pictures of Spider-Man\", only to be corrected by an employee that he's in the poetry industry. He then demands poems about Spider-Man.</p><p>In the <i>Spider-Man 2</i> parody on VH1's <i>ILL-Ustrated</i>, Jameson is portrayed as a Dr. Dre lookalike.</p><p>A parody of J. Jonah Jameson mostly based on J.K. Simmons' performance appears in <i>Superhero Movie</i>.</p><h4>Live-action</h4><p>The character's first live-action appearances were in 1970s television, performed by David White in the television movie and Robert F. Simon in the subsequent television series. In both these incarnations, Jameson's abrasive, flamboyant personality was toned down and the character was portrayed as a more avuncular figure.</p><h3>Films</h3><p>In the <i>Spider-Man</i> movies directed by Sam Raimi, Jameson is portrayed by J. K. Simmons, and serves as a major source of comic relief. Portrayed as a blustering, bombastic man, the movie version of Jameson retains his dislike for Spider-Man, and takes delight in anything that might discredit or defame him. This portrayal has been extremely well-received by fans of the original comics. Stan Lee has said that, assuming the film was made earlier than 2002, he would have liked to have portrayed Jameson in a live-action <i>Spider-Man</i> film, but he has warmly praised Simmons' rendition. In the film, he has a Pencil moustache, unlike in the comics, where he has a toothbrush moustache.</p><h4><i>Spider-Man</i> (film)</h4><p>In the first film, Jameson describes him as a menace and a vigilante, and points out, \"<i>He wears a mask. What's he got to hide?</i>\" Indeed, the only reason he develops an interest in publishing news on the hero is because it sells papers, and upon hearing that no one has been able to get a clear shot of him, he declares, \"<i>If he doesn't want to be famous, I'll make him infamous!</i>\" He also retains much of his cynical, avuncular attitude and brusque manner with his staff, though he willingly protects Peter when the Green Goblin demands to known who he is. When Peter Parker accuses him of slandering Spider-Man, Jameson says, \"<i>I resent that! Slander is spoken. In print, it's libel.</i>\" He holds the dubious honor of providing the nicknames (wanting his staff to immediately copyright the name) for the central villains in both of the first two films: the Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. In each film his office is rearranged and relocated; only the first movie offers an explicit reason for this, as in that film it is partially destroyed by the Green Goblin. A greedy man who demands much of his employees, Jameson is reminiscent of a fast-talking 1940's film character in many ways</p><h4><i>Spider-Man 2</i></h4><p>Throughout the second film, Jameson is shown to know that Spider-Man is a hero, but is too proud to admit it. He even goes so far as to admit it in <i>Spider-Man 2</i> when crime and danger skyrocket and his son's fianc\u00e9e, Mary Jane Watson, is kidnapped after Spider-Man temporarily disappears; true to form, however, he recants almost immediately and becomes infuriated with the web-slinger once again when Spider-Man steals back his costume from the <i>Bugle</i> to confront the rampaging Doctor Octopus.</p><p>The DVD-only <i>Spider-Man 2.1</i> extended cut of the film contains a short scene in which Jameson dons the Spider-Man suit and romps around on his desk, while Robbie Robertson, Betty Brant, and Hoffman watch in a mix of surprise and confusion. The filmmakers cut the scene from the theatrical release because Simmons didn't fit their original image of a paunchy middle-aged man; instead, he fills out the costume fairly well.</p><p><i>Mrs.</i> Jameson is alive and well in the movies, being mentioned in the first and third movies and seen in the second. References to her are usually relayed as a foil to Jameson's miserly ways; when informed by his secretary his wife had lost his checkbook, he replies \"Thanks for the good news.\" At the wedding of his son John Jameson and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson\" rel=\"nofollow\">       Mary Jane Watson</a> in the second film, once it becomes clear that the bride had left the groom at the altar, the first thing Jameson does is tell his wife to call the wedding caterer and \"tell her not to open the caviar\".</p><h4><i>Spider-Man 3</i></h4><p>In <i>Spider-Man 3</i>, Jameson sets Eddie Brock Jr. and Peter Parker up as rivals to earn a staff job, instructing them to obtain unflattering pictures of Spider-Man. He is shown to supposedly have many medical conditions, being warned by Miss Brant (who was informed by Jameson's wife) whenever he is too tense or when he needs to take his pills. Specifically, it is revealed that he has high blood pressure, and Miss Brant must always remind him to watch his temper. Later, Jameson fires Brock when Brock creates and sells to Jameson fake pictures of Spider-Man robbing a bank, in spite of his dislike of the hero, as Brock's photo destroyed his paper's reputation, which has not printed a retraction in 20 years. He is surprised by Parker's new confident and aggressive demeanor, provoked by the black suit, especially when he finds him and Miss Brant flirting on his desk, exclaiming \"Miss Brant, that's not the position I hired you for\". At the climactic battle between Spider-Man, New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom, Jameson, unable to locate Parker, bargains with a little girl in the crowd to obtain her camera to shoot the battle himself. She refuses to sell for less than a hundred dollars. After the stingy Jameson reluctantly pays, he discovers that there is no film in the camera, to which she explains, \"<i>The film's extra,</i>\" much to his fury.</p><h3>Video games</h3><p>Jameson has appeared in many of the <i>Spider-Man</i> video games, usually as a supporting character.</p><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>The gruff editor-in-chief of the <i>Daily Bugle</i> appeared in the 2000 <i>Spider-Man</i> video game voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. He appeared when the Scorpion tried to kill him because Jameson put Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, in the armor suit in which he is now stuck. Spider-Man eventually saves Jameson and defeats Scorpion in battle. However, Jameson doesn't thank Spider-Man because, at the beginning of the game, Spider-Man is seen stealing the seemingly reformed Dr. Otto Octavius' machine (Jameson doesn't know that Spider-Man was framed). He even tells two S.W.A.T. cops to shoot down and kill Spider-Man. Luckily, the hero escapes by jumping out of a window saying, \"<i>J.J., you're out of my will! I mean it this time!</i>\"</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Jameson also appeared in three games based on the films, with his character being based on the film version. In the first game, he is only briefly referenced, although he does appear in the Xbox version, telling Peter to get photos at the zoo of a flaming spider (resulting in a confrontation with Kraven the Hunter). In the second game, he initially supports Quentin Beck's claims that Spider-Man is a fraud, but accuses the two of being in cahoots when it is revealed that Beck is Mysterio. Jameson is voiced by Jay Gordon (first &amp; second Games) &amp; by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J.K._Simmons\" rel=\"nofollow\">       J.K. Simmons</a> (2 \"PSP version\" &amp; 3 games).</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Though never actually appearing, J. Jonah Jameson is mentioned in <i>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance</i> on a VS simulation disc where the heroes fight Scorpion. In <i>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2</i> Commander Maria Hill mentions in a special conversation to Spider-Man if the player chooses anti-registration and Spider-Man is controlled, she says that \"he's just made J. Jonah Jameson a very happy man\".</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>In <i>Spider-Man 3</i>, Jameson is an employer of Peter Parker as in the films and comics, giving him various missions to complete, including photographing giant lizards. He is captured by a side villain Luke Carlyle, and thrown out of a helicopter in mid air with an electric necklace on. Spider-Man then catches Jameson, and has to keep up with the helicopter to stop Jameson getting electrocuted. After Carlyle has been defeated, Jameson attempts to thank Spider-Man, but can't quite bring himself to say it. Spider-Man, after Jameson's stuttered attempts, simply says \"You're welcome\", before swinging away. Later in the game, Jameson hires both Peter Parker and Eddie Brock, Junior, to take photographs of Spider-Man in his new black suit, doing criminal activities. Peter Parker wins this, after revealing Brock's was a fraud.</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Though not appearing in, <i>Marvel Super Heroes</i> and most subsequent Capcom 2-D fighting games featuring Spider-Man, Jameson is mentioned. In his victory pose after winning a round, Spider-Man casts a web up to the \"ceiling\" to the bottom of which he attaches a camera. He then stands over his fallen opponent and makes a \"thumbs-up\" gesture as the camera flashes and says \"<i>One for J.J.</i>\" Jameson does make an appearance in <i>Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter</i> alongside Joseph \"Robbie\" Robertson if Spider-Man is one of the fighters in the \"Night-Cooking\" game show stage. In <i>Marvel vs. Capcom</i>, in addition to the victory pose, Spider-Man poses for a picture with his partner after winning the game, stating \"<i>I know Jameson will use this picture to make me look like a bad guy.</i>\" There are also various winning quotes where he mentions \"J.J.J.\" In <i>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</i>, Spider-Man has an updated version of the aforementioned victory pose, in which he says \"<i>That's why J.J. pays me the big bucks!</i>\"</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>During the second time in the city in the Sega game <i>The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin</i>, Jameson follows the player around bad-mouthing him.</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>Jameson also appears in the <i>Spider-Man</i> pinball machine by Stern Pinball. Simmons also recorded additional lines of custom speech appropriate for a pinball game, such as \"Extra ball\", \"Jackpot\", and \"Hey, kid, you just won a free game.\"</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>J. Jonah Jameson appears in the PlayStation 2 and PSP version of <i>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows</i> voiced by Daran Norris. He has been captured by Spencer Smythe and A.I.M. so that Spencer can clone him and use that clone to discredit J. Jonah Jameson and Spider-Man. This was thwarted by Spider-Man though.</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>While Jameson does not actually appear, in the PC version of the video game based on 2008's <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>, buses with advertising for the <i>Daily Bugle</i> on the sides, appear as vehicles for the Hulk to smash and throw.</li></ul><ul class=\"plain-list\"><li>The Daily Bugle is a playable stage in <i>Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds</i>, and Jameson appears in the background in a helicopter where he shouts at the fighters.</li></ul>", "deck": "J.

He was a gifted surgeon who was enlisted in the <a href=\"/us-army/65-44415/\">U.S. Army</a> and was sent off to war. He would perform emergency battlefield surgery for the injured GIs, until an unexpected blast hit his arm and it had to be amputated. Conners went back to a civilians life and became a research scientist. Due to his missing limb and the ability of lizards to regrow lost appendages, Connors became obsessed in reptilian limb regrowth and studied reptilian biology extensively. After years of working from home with the aid of war buddy <a href=\"/man-thing/29-4988/\">Ted Sallis</a>, Connors ultimately developed a growth serum taken from reptilian DNA. Despite his wife's warnings, he tried it on a rabbit and saw that it was a success He then tried it on himself. After he ingested the formula, his arm indeed grew back, but there was an unexpected side effect. The serum turned him into a vicious, reptilian humanoid monster. Soon after this Peter Parker and <a href=\"/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> where in Florida following stories about a giant man-lizard attacking people in the <a href=\"/everglades/34-56632/\">Everglades</a>. When <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> discovered the truth behind the situatition, he was able to use Conners' notes to help find an antidote to cure him and restore him back to human form.</p><p>Another later attempt to develop the Lizard serum for safe use again resulted in Connors transforming into the Lizard, but on this occasion he was saved thanks to his former colleague <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> and his first team of <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, <a href=\"/beast/29-1462/\">Beast</a> and <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Angel</a> tracking the Lizard down in the swamps so that <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a> could send him into hibernation long enough to develop a cure.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Lizard was created by writer <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and artist <a href=\"/steve-ditko/26-4026/\">Steve Ditko</a>. He first appeared in <a href=\"/the-amazing-spider-man/49-2127/\">The Amazing Spider-Man</a> #6 (Nov. 1963) in the story \"Face-To-Face With The Lizard\".</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>The success of Connors' apparent cure from the Lizard persona was short-lived. A pattern occurred, with stress turning Connors into the Lizard, Spider-Man fighting him, and then forming some kind of temporary cure to reverse the transformation until the next time. A second personality soon formed with the Lizard, one who retained intelligence but was no longer Connors. He envisioned a world where all humans were transformed into super-reptiles like himself and he was their supreme leader and creator. Despite the Lizard's overall hatred of humans, he was often shown to be unwilling to harm his wife <a href=\"/martha-connors/29-11536/\">Martha</a> or their young son <a href=\"/billy-connors/29-6724/\">Billy</a>.</p><p>Soon after his first encounter with Spider-Man, Curt Connors and his family relocated to New York City and Connors eagerly assisted Spider-Man on several occasions. He helped saved <a href=\"../../may-parker/1482/\" rel=\"nofollow\">May Parker</a>, Peter Parker's beloved aunt, when she developed complications from a blood transfusion that Peter had given her by developing a formula that saved her. Connors became a close friend to Peter Parker who for a time worked as his teaching assistant. Connors was unaware that Peter was also Spider-Man.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Spider-Man approached Connors for aid against the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rhino/29-2126/\">Rhino</a> and the scientist developed a formula that dissolved Rhino's armored costume. However Connors was accidentally exposed to several chemicals that caused him to change into the Lizard once more. Spider-Man was narrowly able to defeat the Lizard and force fed him his counter-serum to change Connors back to normal.</p><p>Connors was later kidnapped by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/maggia/65-26082/\">Maggia</a> crime boss <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silvermane/29-13846/\">Silvermane</a> for his chemical expertise. The elderly Silvermane was obsessed with a youth formula enscribed on an ancient clay tablet and wanted Connors to recreate it. However, the extreme stress of his kidnapping ultimately caused Connors to transform into the Lizard once more, greatly complicating Spider-Man's rescue attempt.</p><p>As Connors, he aided Spider-Man in defeating the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rhino/29-2126/\">Rhino</a> by developing a formula to dissolve the Rhino's costume, but accidentally transformed himself into the Lizard due to exposure to the chemicals from the formula - some of which had been used to create the Lizard serum - and was restored by Spider-Man. Connors was later kidnapped and forced to create a rejuvenation serum for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/silvermane/29-13846/\">Silvermane</a>. However, the stress from this caused Connors to transform, the Lizard battled Spider-Man and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a>, and was then restored to normal once again by Spider-Man.</p><p>During another encounter with Spider-Man after Peter's attempts to remove his powers resulted in him growing four extra arms, a bite from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morbius/29-6722/\">Morbius</a> endowed the Lizard with Connors' personality via the infection of a strange enzyme. Connors then synthesized an antidote for himself and Spider-Man using the Morbius enzyme. Curt Connors later aided Spider-Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ka-zar/29-3558/\">Ka-Zar</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a> against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stegron/29-7776/\">Stegron</a>. After the apparent death of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jackal/29-10974/\">Jackal</a>, Dr. Connors determined that Spider-Man was not a clone. Later, the Lizard battled with Stegron and Spider-Man after Stegron kidnapped Billy Connors. For a time, Peter Parker worked as a teaching assistant to Dr. Connors at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empire-state-university/34-43783/\">Empire State University</a>, although Connors had no idea that Peter was actually Spider-Man.</p><h3>Secret Wars and Family Trouble</h3><p>In the <a href=\"../../secret-wars/40978/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Wars</a>, the all-powerful <a href=\"../../beyonder/10300/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beyonder</a> teleported many of Earth-616's greatest heroes and villains to an uninhabited planet to wage war. Lizard was one of the villains there, along with other villains like <a href=\"../../doctor-doom/29-1468/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Doom</a> and perennial Spider-Man foe <a href=\"../../dr-octopus/4455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Octopus</a>. The Lizard has a comparatively small role in the Secret Wars as he was driven away from the villains team early on in the adventure. He fled into the swampland after injuring <a href=\"/molecule-man/29-11880/\">Molecule Man</a>. While in the swamp he met and befriended the <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a> who cared for his wounded arm. He returned to Earth along with the other villains when Molecule Man transported Seattle home.</p><p>When he returned, Martha Connors took Billy and left Connors. Although Curt was a loving husband, she couldn't handle the occasional problem of having a homicidal supervillain as a husband. Curt was stricken with grief, and his actions because of it would lead to his almost death.</p><h3>Fight the Lizard (and Calypso)</h3><p>In all stages of despair, Connors made a last-ditch attempt to control his life and the Lizard. He expended tremendous mental energy and gained weak control over the vicious alter-ego. But unfortunately for the poor man, the evil sorceress <a href=\"../../calypso/15494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Calypso</a> used her voodoo magic to revert him to Lizard and break him into a twisted, savage, vicious state where he was a mindless animal. Spider-Man fought him and Calypso many times in a series of rough, bloody battles before managing to defeat them both. Connors cured himself and submitted to the supervillain prison-<a href=\"/the-vault/34-43582/\">The Vault</a>. Calypso tried to control Lizard again before the villain murdered her, escaped from the Vault, and resurfaced. In a battle with Spider-Man and the bounty hunter <a href=\"../../warrant/7506/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Warrant</a>, Lizard fell into a quicksand pit and seemed to have died.</p><h3>Lizard-Clone and Martha's Death</h3><p>After the original Lizard's apparent death, a huge, mindless animal Lizard appeared and started rampaging around destroying things, causing the thought the transformation was permanent. However, Dr. Connors had survived the quicksand, and when the savage Lizard met him, he reverted to the original Lizard and saved his family, killing the clone. The clone was actually developed when a formula was tested on a piece of the original Lizard's tail, which grew into a full Lizard creature. Lizard had more \"adventures\", mainly trying to contaminate the world's water supply to turn everyone into zombies. His plot failed, and tragedy struck. Both Martha and Billy were diagnosed with cancer. The reason was deduced by Spider-Man, Martha Connors and Billy Connors had been exposed to carcinogens living next to a facility of the Monnaco Corporation. Making matters worse, Curt's arm degenerated. Spider-Man helped Dr. Connors to expose the corrupt corporation, but it was too late. Martha passed away from the disease, and Billy barely survived and grew a vengeance for his father. Billy went to his aunt's care, and the stress drove Dr. Connors mentally unstable.</p><h3>Dark Times</h3><p>Curt revealed a horrible truth to Spider-Man afterwards, about his past. Dr. Connors had gone to New York in hopes of getting a research grant. When the grant went to another scientist, Connors detonated the lab, severely injuring the other man. Lizard was seen leaving the building, but he convinced Peter of his innocence. However, he asked Spider-Man to lock him in the sewers for others' safety. As this happened, the <a href=\"../../daily-bugle/40822/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daily Bugle</a> exposed that the Lizard was the result of transformation. When Spider-Man went down to talk, the Lizard broke free. Lizard admitted to Spider-Man that he had lied. Connors had been controlling the Lizard for a long time, using the transformation to achieve his wicked ends. He smashed up Spider-Man, confronted Billy and horrified him, and finally reverted to Connors. He was broken inside by his deeds, and allowed himself to be arrested so he wouldn't hurt others. Recently, <a href=\"../../green-goblin/1484/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Goblin</a> broke the Lizard out of prison, enhanced his powers, and asked the creature to join his <a href=\"../../sinister-twelve/40481/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinister Twelve</a>, orchestrated to take down Spider-Man. The team quickly failed, and the <a href=\"../../fantastic-four/3804/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fantastic Four</a> and assorted <a href=\"../../avengers/3806/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avengers</a> helped to take the short-lived team down.</p><h3>Lizard, Jr.</h3><p>Even more recently, Billy Connors helped attack Spider-Man in a new guise-a pint-sized version of his father! The Lizard had injected his son with the Lizard formula, and Billy/Lizard Jr. helped nearly kill the wall-crawler. Eventually, the Webslinger captured them both. Lizard Jr. was tragically shot and killed, but Lizard escaped into the relative safety of the sewers and remained at large before joining a new <a href=\"../../sinister-six/40429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sinister Six</a>. It was taken down by <a href=\"../../captain-america/1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>'s <a href=\"../../secret-avengers/40904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Secret Avengers</a>, and Lizard is in prison-for now.</p><p>After the <a href=\"../../civil-war/39-40615/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Civil War</a>, Dr Connors help Spider-Man to formulate a cure for the victims of <a href=\"../../mr-hyde/29-3233/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mr. Hyde</a>, who were given Spider-like powers. He is also monitoring an Initiative trainee named <a href=\"../../komodo/29-42782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Komodo</a>, who stole his formula and now has developed powers just like him. (<em>Source: Wikipedia</em>)</p><h3>Gauntlet</h3><p>Curts life soon began to spiral out his control once again. After getting a new job at a company called Phelcorp he began to hear a voice (most likely the Lizard) telling him to behave violently. He finally cracked when his boss Brian King slept with his assistant whom Connors was attracted to. He felt himself turning into the Lizard again and tried to take a drug to halt the change, but Brian stopped him believing he was trying to turn into the Lizard on purpose. Emerging the Lizard devoured Brian. The Lizard later killed his own son, Billy Connors, with no sign of Dr. Curt Connors being present in the Lizard.</p><p>After killing his own son, <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a> finds <a href=\"../../billy-connors/29-6724/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Billy</a>\u2019s body and follows his tracer to the Lizard. He finds his remains as well and believes Curt to be dead. Suddenly the newly shed Lizard burst out and reveals his new ability to speak. He also explains how the lizard brain has now taken over totally and how he always felt like he was Spider-Man\u2019s prey and now it is the other way around. They begin to fight when Spider-Man begins to feel his primal instinct take over. He runs away and the Lizard takes off while a small bit of the Lizard\u2019s mammal brain tells him he\u2019s naked. Spider-Man goes to Connors\u2019 lab assistant and takes whatever\u2019s left of his antidote and a picture of Billy. Everyone in the city falls under the Lizard\u2019s control and goes crazy fighting each other over territory and possession. Spider-Man takes a vial of antidote and takes on the Lizard again. Lizard mocks him for taking the poison and chaining his inner reptile when Spider-Man spits the antidote into the Lizard\u2019s waiting jaws. Then he stabs him with every last vial of antidote and shoves a picture of Billy in his face. The Lizard becomes confused and Spider-Man is overcome by the crowd. The Lizard comes back and pulls Spider-Man from the swarm of people and takes him to a rooftop nearby. There he tries to rationalize the killing of the mammal brain\u2019s son with Spider-Man, and how he know feels something horrible about the picture he sees in his mind. Spider-Man explains this is shame and part of being a mammal. The Lizard takes off and releases his control on the city. However he does keep a few under his control.</p><h3>Origin of the Species</h3><p>The Lizard is revealed as being the one who attacked <a href=\"../../chameleon/29-4458/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon</a> and stole <a href=\"../../menace/29-50406/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menace\u2019s</a> baby.</p><h3>No Turning Back</h3><p>When Spider-man that Morbius developed a cure for the lizard , spider-man confronts the monster in the sewers and fights him for a very long time, finely morbius and spidey stab the lizard withe enough hypodermic harpoons for Max to cure Connors. Connors is seemed to be cured but in reality the lizard is still in control, even in Connor's body.</p><p>Morbius and Spiderman take the Lizard(believing that Curt is in control) to Horizon Labs. Planning to be back in his lizard from again, Lizard pretends to grieve to loss of Billy telling everybody he needs time alone. To save himself more time Lizard puts some blood samples into the the air ducts bringing the scent all around the lab. This makes Morbius bite Sajani, thus leading to Spiderman chasing Morbius into the city. Lizard tells Max Modell they can cure Morbius and Max joins Lizard in the lab to help him. He was able to restores Connor's lost arm and then he begins with attacking Max. He uses Modell as a test subject for his experiments on becoming the Lizard inside and out again.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Doctor Curtis Connors gave himself superhuman powers as a result of exposure to mutagenic chemicals, allowing him to transform into the Lizard. In human form, he has none of his superhuman powers, but he is highly intelligent and a well known scientist in fields of genetics, physics, biochemistry, and herpetology.</p><p>When Connors is transformed into the Lizard, his strength is increased to superhuman levels. Likewise, his speed, stamina, agility, and reflexes are also raised to a level equivalent to that of Spider-Man. He can also scale walls using a combination of his sharp claws and micro-scales on his hands and feet that create molecular friction like those of a gecko lizard. He is highly resistant to injury due to his thick scaly hide, allowing him to resist punctures and lacerations from ordinary weapons and lower-caliber firearms. In addition, the Lizard has highly enhanced healing abilities which allow him to quickly recover from grievous wounds, including regenerating lost limbs. He also has a powerful tail which he can whip at high speeds. The Lizard has razor-sharp teeth set in muscular jaws that can deal a lethal bite. Like a reptile, he has cold-blooded characteristics and is therefore sensitive to drops in temperature; a sufficiently cold environment will cause his metabolism to slow drastically and become dormant if he is exposed to cold temperatures for too long.</p><p>The Lizard can mentally communicate and command all reptiles within a mile of himself via limited telepathy. He has also on at least one occasion secreted powerful pheromones which caused nearby humans to behave violently. Post-<i>Brand New Day</i>, a further enhancement of his telepathy granted him the power of telepathically compelling humans to act out their primal urges, by suppressing emotional control in their amygdala (the \"lizard brain\").</p><p>Based on various physiological and environmental factors, the Lizard's intelligence can range from bestial and animalistic to normal human intelligence. The Lizard personality has most often manifested with human intelligence, capable of speech and higher reasoning, although some versions have been more feral than others. During the <a href=\"/secret-wars/39-40978/\">Secret Wars</a> in particular, he appeared less ruthless than his normal portrayal, showing concern for <a href=\"/volcana/29-14536/\">Volcana</a> and the <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a> after they showed him kindness despite his usual disdain for humans. However, even when operating at the level of a human, the Lizard is rarely as intelligent as Dr. Connors, showing on many occasions an inability to understand his human-self's work and use it to further his own ends despite his best efforts.</p><p>The Lizard has apparently \"destroyed\" the Curt Connors persona, but has subsequently begun to display some of Connors's human emotions. In contrast to his previously feral nature, he has also shown sufficient intellectual capabilities to understand Connors' work and use it for himself, although he is still hampered by his inability to fully comprehend human emotions.</p><h3>Characteristics</h3><p><b>Height:</b> 6'8\" (as the Lizard); 5'11\" (as Curt Connors)</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 510 lbs (as the Lizard); 175 lbs (as Curt Connors)</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Red (as the Lizard); Blue (as Curt Connors)</p><p><b>Hair:</b> None (as the Lizard); Brown (as Curt Connors)</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-1610 - Ultimate universe</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"140038\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5959/140038-1077-lizard_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultimate\"><img id=\"140038\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5959/140038-1077-lizard_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultimate</div></div></div></div><p>In the Ultimate universe, Dr. Curt Connors (last name is spelled differently) transforms into the Lizard.

The Lizard obsessed with riding the world of mammalian life and returning to an age of reptiles. When Connors transforms into the Lizard he becomes a cold-blooded creature, Spider-man exploited this to force the Lizard into a hibernation so an antidote could be given.</p><p>Later on, the Lizard was then kidnapped by the <a href=\"/serpent-society/65-28980/\">Serpent Society</a> as they tried to force Curt to stain the water supply with his Lizard formula, so that everyone in the city would turn into Lizards. But he prevented them from doing so by drinking the formula himself, which made him turn into a giant form of the Lizard.

His athletic prowess and phenomenal speed on the pitch earned him the nickname \"Flash\" and made him one of the most popular kids in the class. While his popularity made life easier at school, he had a difficult life at home. His father Harry\u2014an alcoholic police officer\u2014beat him regularly and derided Flash's athleticism despite his many accomplishments. Due to his rough life at home, Flash often took his anger out on other students who he felt were weak, such as \"Puny\" <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a>, who was one of his regular victims. While attending Midtown, Flash began dating <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/liz-allan/29-15408/\">Liz Allan</a>, who was the most popular girl in school. When Liz started to develop an attraction towards Peter, Flash became jealous and began targeting Parker with his bullying almost exclusively. After <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> made his first appearace, however, Flash unknowingly became Parker's greatest\u2014and sometimes only\u2014fan.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Flash Thompson was created by Marvel artists <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/steve-ditko/26-4026/\">Steve Ditko</a> in 1962. He was first introduced into the comic world in the comic book <i>Amazing Fantasy #15</i>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The University years</h3><p>After graduating from Midtown, Thompson enrolled at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/empire-state-university/34-43783/\">Empire State University</a> on a sports scholarship. He rapidly developed a friendship there with fellow students <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/harry-osborn/29-2478/\">Harry Osborn</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gwen-stacy/29-1480/\">Gwen Stacy</a>. In an unexpected attempt at inclusion, Flash tried to introduce Parker to Gwen and Harry, but Peter's mind was occupied with his <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aunt-may/29-1780/\">Aunt May's</a> ailing health and he failed to introduce himself, ignoring them completely. Harry and Flash misinterpreted this as snobbery and felt slighted by the incident. Because of this, Peter continued to be a target of bullying from Flash and now Harry as well, who both repeatedly annoyed and picked at Peter. Despite this and because of Gwen's repeated attempts to befriend Peter, little by little, Parker became a part of Flash's circle. Flash also became friends with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">Mary Jane</a> who was Peter's best friend at the time and who he introduced to the group.</p><p>Before graduation, Flash suddenly decided to enroll in the army. The entire group, including Parker, were supportive of him and what they felt was a brave and noble decision. While stationed in South East Asia, he met Vietnamese native <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sha-shan/29-17635/\">Sha Shan</a> and fell in love with her. When he later returned to New York, he bumped into Sha Shan in a restaurant. She refused to talk with him at first but Flash persisted until he learned the reason for her strange behavior. She had become a supervillain and enemy of Spider-Man known as \"Sister Sun,\" a member of the <a href=\"/legion-of-light/65-56633/\">Legion of Light</a>. She'd been forced into membership by her husband, Achmed Korba ( <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brother-power/29-34906/\">Brother Power</a>). With the help of Spider-Man and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/razorback/29-6057/\">Razorback</a>, Flash succeeded in liberating Sha Shan from her involvement with the Legion and her unhappy marriage, and she became Flash's girlfriend. Thompson's relationship with Sha Shan would not last, however. After a brief separation from her, Flash\u2014buckling under mental stresses and behaving recklessly\u2014began an affair with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/betty-brant/29-2484/\">Betty Brant</a>. This would eventually lead to a permanent split with Sha Shan.</p><h3>Hobgoblin</h3><p>It was at this time that Flash boasted on live television that the villain <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hobgoblin/29-7605/\">Hobgoblin</a> was a coward, igniting a rivalry with the costumed crook. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hobgoblin-kingsley/29-7605/\">Roderick Kingsley</a>, the current wearer of the Hobgoblin mantle, decided to take his revenge upon Flash for his brash words by convincing the public that Flash Thompson himself was Hobgoblin. Kingsley kidnapped and dressed Flash in a Hobgoblin costume, then brainwashed him into battling Spider-Man\u2014a battle Flash lost easily as he lacked both powers and experience. Later, Hobgoblin weapons, costumes, and other incriminating items were found in his apartment, having been planted there by Kingsley. Kingsley's frame-up succeeded and Flash went to prison. While in prison, Flash was targeted by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scourge/29-14461/\">Scourge of the Underworld</a>\u2014a villainous group dedicated to killing costumed criminals who believed the accusations that he was the Hobgoblin\u2014but Flash was saved by interference from Spider-Man and the real Hobgoblin. Flash later turned to Spider-Man for help and succeeded in cleaning his reputation.</p><h3>Coma</h3><p>The price for that victory, however, was high. Flash had injured his arm during a battle against a different Hobgoblin, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hobgoblin/29-26374/\">Jason Macendale</a>, which resulted in his football career coming to an end. No longer in a relationship with Betty Brant and lacking job opportunities, Flash fell into alcoholism. Surprisingly, it was <a href=\"/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> who succeeded in turning Flash back on the path to sobriety, however as the Green Goblin, Osborn also tried to destroy Flash\u2019s respect for Spider-Man. Norman failed at this and decided to kill Flash instead, concealing the murder as an accident involving alcohol. Flash survived this attempt on his life, but was put into a coma.</p><h3><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man-the-other/39-43776/\">Spider-Man: The Other</a></h3><p>When Flash awoke from his coma, he became a gym teacher at his old high school, Midtown High. He was suffering from severe memory loss, however, and this resulted in him returning to old habits such as bullying Peter, who was also working at Midtown as a science teacher. When Parker's identity of Spider-Man was publicly announced during the events of the superhero <a href=\"/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, Flash did not believe it and thought that he Parker just protecting Spidey's real identity. He even challenged Peter to dodge ball, but got knocked out since Peter\u2014unaware of Flash's memory troubles\u2014thought he didn't have to hold back with his powers. Flash was rushed into the clinic where he flirted with the nurse, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/miss-arrow/29-41738/\">Miss Arrow</a>. Flash finally believed that Peter was Spider-Man when he saw him protecting the students from the villains that were taking up the name of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mephisto/29-2635/\">Mephisto</a>. Flash was later kidnapped by Miss Arrow\u2014who was actually an evil counterpart of Spider-Man's composed of shape-changing Ero or \"pirate\" spiders\u2014when she chose him to be her \"mate and sustenance,\" but later simply wanted to kill him because she saw Spider-Man as a more powerful candidate.</p><h3>Military career</h3><p>Years later, having recovered from the coma and spent time working as a high school gym teacher, Flash rejoined the military. It was during a tour of duty in Iraq that Flash's squad was ambushed. Flash afforded himself courageously and saved the life of his commanding officer, but sustained grievous injuries to his legs, becoming a double-amputee. Flash's old circle of friends, including Parker and even ex-girlfriend Sha Shan, helped Flash deal with his loss. During his recovery Flash reignited his relationship with Betty Brant.</p><h3><b><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brand-new-day/39-49940/\">Brand New Day</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/one-more-day/39-49939/\">One More Day</a></b></h3><p>Following the events of <i>Brand New Day</i>, Flash\u2014now crippled from injuries he sustained while serving the military\u2014attended a party being thrown by Parker's circle of friends for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/harry-osborn/29-2478/\">Harry Osborn</a>. Just like everyone else, Flash did not seem to remember that Peter Parker is Spider-Man. Though Peter and Flash were portrayed as friends, he did occasionally give Peter a hard time. Flash confided to Peter that Spider-Man was his inspiration while fighting in Iraq, so much so that he risked his life to help save his platoon. After protecting his platoon from an ambush Flash selflessly rescued his commanding officer by dragging him out of rubble rather than wait for reinforcements and medical assistance. His act of heroism cost Flash his legs but he was awarded for his courage with the congressional medal of honor. To keep active, Flash became very involved with wheel chair sports like wheelchair basketball and racing. When Peter Parker lost his job suddenly, he attempted to earn some quick money by selling embarrassing photos of Spider-Man. Angry about this portrayal of his hero, Flash wheeled himself over to Peter's apartment and yelled for him to come out to fight him since the building is not handicap accessible. While the two didn't come to violence, they traded insults and Flash lost some of the respect he'd developed for Peter. Flash continued to heal during this time\u2014both physically and emotionally\u2014going through rehabilitation under the care of his old flame, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sha-shan/29-17635/\">Sha Shan</a>, who generously offered to serve as his physical trainer.</p><h3><b>Birth of A New <a href=\"/venom/49-39301/\">Venom</a></b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1624755\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64034/1624755-venom002_cvr_super.jpg\" title=\"Venom (Flash Thompson)\"><img id=\"1624755\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64034/1624755-venom002_cvr_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Venom (Flash Thompson)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Venom (Flash Thompson)</div></div></div></div><p>During the <a href=\"/siege-storming-asgard-heroes-villains/49-31275/\">Siege of Asgard</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mac-gargan/29-4484/\">Mac Gargan</a> is separated from the <a href=\"/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a> symbiote (later becomign the Scorpion once again). The symbiote fall into the possession of the US government and was contained in a secret government base controlled by the Department of Homeland Security. The DHS was inclined to use the symbiote to create a new super-powered soldier to help protect the country. After trying and failing to bond the symbiote with another host, resulting in the candidate's death, the government decided to approach another candidate. Around this time Flash was approached by the Department of Homeland Security as a candidate to be bonded with the parasitic alien in order to create a new super soldier. Flash agreed and became Agent Venom, controlling the suit with a combination of sedatives and strength of will. The Government put strict limits on Flash's role as Venom, telling him that he would only be allowed to serve as Venom for twenty missions in total\u2014that after he had served his time he would never be allowed contact with the symbiote again. This rule was intended to prevent the development of addictive behavior regarding use of the suit. Given drugs to control the symbiote and suppress its personality, Flash Thompson became one of the government's covert men in the battle against evil. While having the abilities of Spider-Man\u2014amplified even beyond Parker's strength levels\u2014Flash Thompson set out to simply survive all twenty missions without surrending control to the Venom symbiote.</p><p>Flash's first mission sent him to the nation of Nrosvekistan. He was assigned to find Doctor Ferid Ekmecic and capture him. While on the mission he discovered a woman and her baby who had wandered into the line of fire. He saved the pair by leading them to safety, but jus when he was about to capture the doctor he encountered the new <a href=\"/jack-olantern/29-40901/\">Jack O' Lantern</a> who then incapacitated him and escaped with the doctor while Flash gave pursuit. While fighting Jack, Flash began to lose control of the suit, but while the villain had him pinned to the ground Flash managed to throw a live grenade into his mask, blowing his jaw off. Jack survived this and attempted to complete his mission by escaping with the doctor. As Jack was flying away, Flash made the decision to kill the doctor by snapping his neck with webbing. When Flash returned to base, his commanding officer General Dodge dressed him down for losing control of the suit. Later, when Flash finally made it back home, he found Betty Brant in tears, having waited for him for six hours late for a date they'd planned together. With Flash being unable to explain his wherabouts and tardiness due to the secrecy of his status as Venom, Betty assumed that he was drinking again and slammed the door in his face.</p><p>Flash next appeared on the run from <a href=\"/kraven-the-hunter/29-2475/\">Kraven The Hunter</a> in the <a href=\"/savage-land/34-21766/\">Savage Land</a>. Despite being poisoned, he continued his mission to stop a shipment of illicit Antarctic <a href=\"/vibranium/18-40919/\">Vibranium</a>, a dangerous and valuable metal. Disoriented and unable to locate Kraven, Flash took refuge in a cave, where he tried to figure out how long he'd even been in the Savage Land. While in this cave he once again crossed paths with Kraven and the two resumed their fight. While fighting, Kraven woke giant bats that resided in the cave and their powerful hypersonic screeching separated Flash from the symbiote. This left Flash momentarily at Kraven's mercy, but he was saved when the bats swarmed the two humans, dragging Flash and Kraven both into the sky. Flash used the last of his ammunition to shoot the bat and grabbed onto a ledge to keep from falling to his death. While Flash was on the ground recovering, he was convinced that he will still die from the poison when the symbiote located him and rebonded with Thompson, telling him that it needs him and knows he needs it. Elsewhere, the <a href=\"/crime-master-brant/29-85181/\">new</a> <a href=\"/crime-master-brant/29-85181/\">Crime Master</a> and Jack O' Lantern used surveillance to capture images of Flash when he was separated from the symbiote, putting his identity in jeopardy.</p><p>Jack O'Lantern put this information to use by kidnapping Betty Brant. Flash, still in the Savage Land, had lost all control of the symbiote. Although he contined to pursue his mission objectives, he slaughtered numerous henchmen guarding the vibranium and blew up the entire isntallation once he'd hijacked the helicopter carrying the shipment of vibranium. When Flash attempted to contact his home base, he instead received a message from Jack O' Lantern showing Betty as a hostage, offering to exchange her for the vibranium. Conflicted and still struggling to contain the symbiote's personality, Flash flew the helicopter back to New York City and delivered the metal to the criminals. Crime Master allowed him 5 minutes to get to Betty Brant, who was being held in a warehouse rigged with explosives. On his way to save Betty he was intercepted and subdued by Spider-man, who has just recently learned of Betty's capture and suspected Venom's involvement.</p><p>In his desperation to save Betty, Flash lost all control of the suit. With the Venom persona fully in control, his hatred for Spider-man took over and the two fought bitterly, wasting precious time needed to save Betty. Seeing his loss of control, the government made an attempt to detonate Thompson with explosives implanted in him as a safety precaution, but this fails as the suit had secretly removed this device and planeted it on one of Crime Master's henchmen. After a long battle, Flash managed to wrest enough control from the symbiot to retreat and locate a pharmacy where he could locate some sedatives to assist in controlling Venom. He then resumed his attempt to rescue Betty, but failed to get to the building on time. Thankfully, Spider-man had already rescued her, having gone there directly after disengaging from his fight with Venom. During debriefing, Thompson reminded his team that despite his temporary loss of control, he is still one of the good guys and he was able to control the suit in the end.</p><h3><b><a href=\"/spider-island/39-56485/\">Spider-Island</a></b></h3><p>Just before the spider infection began to spread across New York City, Flash's father was put in the hospital, bedridden due to cirrhosis of the liver. Flash's father begged to talk to his son, but Flash left when was called into action as Agent Venom to deal with the developing crisis.</p><p>Flash reported to a bridge on the Hudson river in order to stop <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Spider-King</a>\u2014one of the <a href=\"/queen/29-41418/\">Queen's</a> henchmen\u2014from spreading the infection to New Jersey. During the confrontation, Flash received a call from Betty that confirmed his father didn't have much time left. With help from the hero <a href=\"/gravity/29-40452/\">Gravity</a>, Spider-King was incapacitated and taken back to <a href=\"/project-rebirth-20/12-55992/\">Project Rebirth 2.0's</a> headquarters. After waking up and escaping, Spider-King caused havoc in the base and almost killed Flash, but General Dodge's dog Samson bonded with the venom symbiote temporarily and saved him.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2064417\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31005/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki.png\" title=\"Samson-Venom!\"><img id=\"2064417\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31005/2064417-fdeswhtyjruki_medium.png\" alt=\"Samson-Venom!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Samson-Venom!</div></div></div></div><p>Flash then rejoined with the symbiote and defeated Spider-King a second time. After managing to contain Spider-King and reveal his identity as Steve Rogers, Captain America, Flash was ordered to use the symbiote's camouflage powers to mimic Spider-King's appearance and infiltrate the Queen's base, ultimately to kill the leader herself.</p><p>Flash was about to kill the Queen as Spider-King when it was revealed by a clone of <a href=\"/jackal/29-10974/\">Miles Warren</a>, the Jackal, that <a href=\"/eddie-brock/29-6733/\">Anti-Venom</a>, former host of the Venom symbiote Eddie Brock, was curing desperate vagrants in the \"Our Lady Of Saints\" Church. After the Queen killed the clone, she ordered Spider-King to go and kill Anti-Venom. Flash left immediately, contacting <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Reed Richards</a> of the <a href=\"/future-foundation/65-57552/\">Future Foundation</a> to inform him that a cure for the spider plague existed. Coordinating with General Dodge and Project Rebirth 2.0, Flash received updated orders to capture Anti-Venom so that Reed and <a href=\"/horizon-labs/34-57110/\">Horizon Labs</a> could make a cure to the spider-infection based on his suit's properties.</p><p>After a long confrontation with Anti-Venom, the symbiote attempted to rejoin with Eddie Brock, weakening the Anti-Venom suit enough to actualy join with Brock for a brief moment. However, Flash reminded the symbiote that Eddie would always fight it now and that Flash still needs it. The symbiote left Eddie and rejoined Flash, allowing Anti-Venom's suit to heal while Flash transported him to Richards' location. Flash left Anti-Venom at Horizon Labs where Brock readily agreed to allow Mr. Fantastic to work on using his suit to develop a cure for the infected.</p><p>Flash then returned to the hospital to visit his father and they both reminisced about the positive memories they shared of listening to records together in their old basement. Flash told his father that, despite their difficulties, he wouldn't have picked anyone else to be his dad. Then Flash's father passed away in front of him.</p><p>Betty offered to stay by Flash's side in his moment of grief and handed him a letter his father had asked her to transcribe for him before Flash made it back to the hospital. However, as the infection was getting worse, Flash felt it was his duty to continue the fight against the Queen's forces. He gave Betty his fully loaded service pistol, and left her at the hospital, telling her that he was going to find an evacuation point so they can both escape. In reality, Flash rejoined the fray as Venom, seeking to assassinate The Queen. In the attempt, however, he is pushed back by her sonic scream attack, which the symbiote is vulnerable to. Steve Rogers himself came to his Flash's aid and the two managed to put her down briefly, Flash using Cap's shield to deliver what they both believe to be a mortal blow. Although the Queen then transformed into a giant Spider form, Flash continued to aid in the battle until she was ultimately killed by the rejuvenated clone of Peter Parker, Kaine.</p><p>After the Queen's death, New York was in chaos. All the spider-people had turned back to normal, but had lost their clothes in the process. <a href=\"/damage-control/65-4951/\">Damage Control</a> took care of the problem, but in the middle of this, an old villain called The Hijacker decided that this was his chance to make one last big score and quit for life. He used a giant tank to rob several banks, and he didn't bother to stop for civillians. Flash, still looking for Betty, found The Hijacker and was told to take him down. Flash witnesses Hijacker's tank run over a security guard, followed by a mother and child. This causes Flash to lose control, and he fakes his own death by allowing the tank to run him over. When Hijacker returns to his lair to inspect the cash, Flash emerges, enraged. As Venom, he viciously mauls Hijacker, breaks his fingers, and bites his head off and spits it out. Flash decides to head home.</p><p>Although Flash had lost his father's letter in the fighting, he met with Betty later that day in their apartment. She had safely locked herself in a utility closet when she succumbed to the spider infection's transformation effects. She revealed that she still had a copy of the letter she'd penned out in shorthand. Sitting together in their first peaceful moment together since Spider-Island began, she read his father's last words to Flash out loud to him.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As Venom, Flash has all the abilities of a Spider-Man including enhanced strength, speed, wall-crawling, and\u2014unlike the original Spider-Man\u2014he can generate his own webbing from his wrist. He is strong enough to tear the head off a tank and fast enough to dodge bullets from machine guns. He can also generate tendrils from the suit to hold multiple weapons, such as machine guns. He is also able to use the shape-changing properties of the suit in order to create disguises for himself, such as an <a href=\"/aim/65-13497/\">A.I.M.</a> agent's uniform. This makes it ideal for Flash to work as a secret agent for the government.</p><p>Recently, the Venom symbiote and Flash have bonded.</p><p>Flash also has military training and experience from his time in the army and a tour of duty fighting insurgents in the Iraq War. The suit even forms makeshift legs for Flash, which he lost during his time in the military.</p><p><b>[Formerly]</b></p><p><b>Unlike Peter Parker, Flash is able to manipulate the symbiote with a combination of oral sedatives and strong will. However when Flash gets angry he loses control of the symbiote and conversely it begins to control him. This will also happen if he is in the suit for more than 48 hours.</b></p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><h3>House of M (Earth-58163)</h3><p>In this reality, Flash is the play-by-play commentator for the \"Sapien Deathmatch.\"</p><h3>MC2 (Earth-982)</h3><p>In this alternate future, Flash is now the coach of his high school alma mater, Midtown High. He married <a href=\"/black-cat/29-1479/\">Felicia Hardy</a>, but later got a divorce. They had a daughter together named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/felicity-hardy/29-49501/\">Felicity Hardy</a>. He still doesn't know that Peter Parker is Spider-Man, nor that Felicia was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a>. He is also unaware that Mayday Parker\u2014daughter of Peter and Mary Jane Watson and star player on the school's varisty women's basketball team\u2014is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-girl/29-3365/\">Spider-Girl</a>.</p><h3>Ultimate Universe (Earth-1610)</h3><p>In this reality, Flash also goes to high school with Peter Parker and bullies him, except his real name is Fred and he is a star on the basketball team instead of the football team. This version of Flash is consistently harder on Parker, shows bigotry toward mutants, and seems to have far fewer redeemable qualities than his Earth-616 counterpart. It was revealed that when Gwen Stacy died, Flash had a crush on her and had wanted Parker to set them up together.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Films</h3><h4><i>Spider-Man</i></h4><p>In the 2002 film <i>Spider-Man,</i> Thompson was played by Joe Manganiello. He is depicted as Mary Jane's boyfriend at the start of the film, and, like his comic book counterpart, is a bully who torments Peter. In this film, Harry also goes to high school with Peter and Flash, and instead of taking Flash's side in the bullying he is a friend of Peter's and also sometimes a target of Flash's. Later in the film, after Peter accidentally uses a web to splash Flash with a tray of food, a fight between them breaks out in the school's hallway. Peter wins this fight, discovering his new powers in the process and knocking Flash to the ground with just one punch. Mary Jane later tells Flash that he was secretly grateful Parker didn't hurt him more. At graduation he and Mary Jane break up.</p><h4><i>Spider-Man 3</i></h4><p>Flash also makes a cameo appearance at the end of <i>Spider-Man 3,</i> attending Harry Osborn's funeral.</p><h4><i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i></h4><p>Chris Zylka announced on November 20, 2010 that he will be playing Flash in the 2012 Spider-Man reboot, <i>The Amazing Spider-Man</i>.</p><h3>Television</h3><h4><i>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</i></h4><p>The television show <i>Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends</i> was Flash Thompson's first animated appearance, where he was voiced by Frank Welker. In the episode \"Video-Man,\" he discovers that Angelica Jones and Firestar are one and the same person, but he is unable to remember by the end of the episode. In \"Spider-Man Unmasked,\" Sandman learns Spider-Man's true identity as Peter Parker and Firestar tricks Flash into wearing a Spider-Man's costume to a party, which successfully misleads the Sandman into thinking he's made a mistake. In the end, Flash tries to take some credit in Sandman's defeat but Peter throws some sand at him, scaring him.</p><h4><i>Spider-Man</i> (1994 TV series)</h4><p>In the 1994 cartoon <i>Spider-Man: The Animated Series</i>, Flash was voiced by Patrick Labyorteaux. This version of Flash repeatedly tries to develop a romantic relationship with Felicia Hardy (the Black Cat), but is unsuccessful. He later finds a more comfortable relationship with the brainy Debra Whitman. Flash does not physically bully Peter in this series, but he does trade insults with him on various occasions. He is an outspoken fan of Spider-Man, refusing to believe Jameson's reporting that a rampage by the Insidious Six was caused by Spider-Man. Flash's loyalty to Spider-Man was vindicated when this was exposed as a frame up by the Chameleon.</p><p>Although Peter and Flash continued their rivalry, he was invited to Peter's wedding where he met Felicia again. Flash tried to get along with the other beautiful girls in attendence but repeatedly failed, sometimes being pushed back by Debra Whitman.</p><h4><i>Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</i></h4><p>In <i>Spider-Man: The New Animated Series</i>, Flash appears in the episode \"Flash Memory,\" and is voiced by Devon Sawa. This version is based on the high school Flash, although his dislike for Peter is actually pushed to new extremes. Not only does Flash bully and insult Peter, at one point he is shown to even be willing to endanger Peter's life.</p><h4><i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i></h4><p>Eugene \"Flash\" Thompson appears in <i>The Spectacular Spider-Man</i>, voiced by Joshua LeBar. He continues to bully Parker, even when Peter already has his super powers. Flash is always trying to out smart Parker but usually fails. He is similar to his original portrayal in the comics, dating Liz Allan until they break up in the episode \"Reaction,\" seemingly due to Liz developing a crush on Peter. In \"The Uncertainty Principle,\" he had to be a cheerleader for Halloween due to a bet he lost to Peter in an earlier episode, but convinced the rest of the football team to also dress as cheerleaders to spare himself the shame. He and Mary Jane had also been voted the king and queen of the Fall Formal, which leads him to try asking out Mary Jane, but she turns him down as she did not want an actual relationship. After seeing Peter in his Spider-Man costume (Parker claimed it was his Halloween costume to protect his identity), he argued that Peter looked nothing like Spidey and he should've dressed up like the wall-crawler himself instead. After Peter becomes angrier and more easily agitated from being bonded with the Venom symbiote, it is Flash that snaps Peter back into reality by reminding him that his friends only want to help. Flash later shows his more heroic side when he and his friends help save Gwen Stacy from falling to her death at the Thanksgiving Day Parade.</p><p>In \"First Steps\" it is revealed that he and Peter were best friends in Nursery School. Peter also gave Flash his trademark nickname because of his tendency to streak as a little boy. He is also shown to have an attraction to the show's version of Sha Shan, who doesn't want anything to do with him. However, she eventually went out with him after he reported Harry's use of the Goblin serum on the team, feeling that it's better that he earn trophies fair and square than cheat.</p>", "deck": "Flash attended the same high school and university as Peter Parker, who would later be known as Spider-Man.

The children are then of no consequence to the parent. Thus, the <a href=\"../../venom/29-1486/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Venom</a> symbiote felt no need to inform Brock of the existence of the new symbiote). This Venom offspring gets into a cut on Brock's cellmate <a href=\"/cletus-kasady/29-85179/\">Cletus Kasady</a>, an insane serial killer, thus bonding with his blood and transforming him into Carnage (also causing his symbiote to turn red).

Cletus Kasady is in complete control of the symbiote, unlike Eddie Brock who still puts up some fights with his own alien. Unlike Venom, Carnage refers to himself as \"I\" instead of \"we\" because Kasady and Carnage have become one being literally to the point that the symbiote lives in his blood. Perhaps due in part to his insanity, Carnage's strength and abilities far exceed those of his predecessors; Venom and Spider-Man, and grow only with his blood-lust.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><h3>A Web of Spiders</h3><p>After his escape, Kasady embarks on a citywide killing spree. Kasady is later found by <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Man</a>, at the burned down remains of St. Estes Home for Boys.

Later, Venom decided to reabsorb the Carnage symbiote \"for good.\" Without the symbiote, Kasady retained the Carnage persona by costuming himself in red paint and continuing his killing sprees (albeit as a powerless human) but him being a regular man now Spider-Man had no problem webbing him up and sending him to jail. But soon after, Kasady was sucked into a black hole and straight into <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Negative Zone</a> war between <a href=\"../../blastaar/29-10963/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blastaar</a> and the Living Bomb, <a href=\"../../burst/29-66243/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burst</a> and the Super Hero called <a href=\"../../dusk/29-4805/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dusk</a>. Kasady teamed up with Blastaar, Cletus discovered that he had been called by another symbiote trapped in the Negative Zone. How this symbiote is an identical copy, or where it came from, has yet to be explained. So after a quick bonding, Carnage was back. However Blastaar quickly realized that annihilating Earth would result in the destruction of the entire universe and called it off. Carnage, on the other hand, was practically frothing at the mouth at the chance to wipe out trillions of lives and attempted to activate Blastaar's universe destroying machine, but only send himself and Spider-man back to Earth, and was once again taken into custody by the police. So Cletus Kasady as Carnage was back to being one of Spider-Man's deadliest foes and continued his rampage throughout Manhattan. However, the issues in which Kasady discovered the replica had references to the Spider-Man Unlimited TV series which had been airing at the time and which featured the Carnage symbiote as one of its villains. In this same issue, Spider-Man himself briefly gained the costume the animated version of him from that series wore.</p><h3>Maximum Carnage</h3><p>Perhaps the most famous storyline in which Carnage appears is the 1993 Spider-Man event <a href=\"../../maximum-carnage/39-41409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maximum Carnage</a>. Carnage ends up escaping from an asylum and attacks the doctors and breaks out a super villain named <a href=\"../../shriek/29-15232/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shriek</a> in which the two start a romantic bond with each other. Later on, they get a whole Carnage \"family\" of psychotic super-villains (consisting of <a href=\"../../demogoblin/29-15272/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Demogoblin</a>, <a href=\"../../carrion/29-14507/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carrion</a> and <a href=\"../../doppelganger/29-15274/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doppelganger</a>) and overtake New York in a twisted killing spree where he randomly kills hundreds if not thousands of innocent people and throws the city into mindless chaos. They are eventually driven back by Spider-Man, Venom, the <a href=\"../../black-cat/29-1479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Cat</a>, <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"../../nightwatch/29-7505/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightwatch</a>, <a href=\"../../cloak-and-dagger/65-43574/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cloak And Dagger</a>, <a href=\"../../deathlok/29-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deathlok</a>, <a href=\"../../morbius/29-6722/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Morbius</a> and <a href=\"../../firestar/29-2101/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>. His partnership with <a href=\"../../shriek/29-15232/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shriek</a> and the other villains would fade over time and later almost completely disappear in his big battle with Spider-Man and his allies. However, despite Carnage's apparent death at the hands of Deathlok using his \"Magni Illuminizer\", Carnage shockingly returns out of a lake just as Venom complains to Spider-Man that he wanted to kill Carnage himself. He had faked his own death (most likely by covering one of his victims in a mock symbiote outfit).</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"85030\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/85030-39255-carnage_super.jpg\" title=\"Carnage the Mad Symbiote.\"><img id=\"85030\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/229/85030-39255-carnage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Carnage the Mad Symbiote.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Carnage the Mad Symbiote.</div></div></div></div><p>He would fight the two viciously. As Venom hunts him down he begins suffering a complete mental breakdown leading him to revisit his bloody past at Ryker's Prison, the St. Estes Home for Boys,dig up his mother at a cemetery in which a final fight between him and Spider-Man and Venom would ensue. In the end, Venom would drag Carnage into a big explosion, defeating him.</p><p>Cletus was later hauled off to get cured from the alien symbiote which lived in his blood. He later escaped by scratching his tongue against a tooth which he filed down to a needle point in order to release the alien. Spider-man later shows up to stop him with a sonic gun, however Carnage uses two near by cops as a distraction to take out the gun for good, and shortly after kills the cops. Carnage then takes the police car and drives off to visit Billy, his first and maybe only friend of his life to kill him. Carnage figured that people would never expect him to go after a specific target, since all he does it random murder, this makes it all the more fun for him. Carnage told Billy about their first meeting and tells him why he is going to kill him. He says that \"In a world of carnage and chaos there can be no enemies, only victims, making this the perfect example\". Spider-man tracks Carnage down when a battle to the death ruptured. Carnage nearly defeated the Web-Slinger, when Billy distracted him and trick him out of using his symbiote. Spider-man landed a punch square in the jaw which knocked the killer out cold. Kasady went back to Ravencroft, and as he sits in his cell he waits. He figures they expect him to escape, which is why he does the exact opposite, because doing the unexpected is what makes him free.</p><h3>Web of Carnage</h3><p>In the 1996 \"Web of Carnage\" storyline, the Carnage symbiote escapes from the Ravencroft Institute through the plumbing where Cletus Kasady is incarcerated, seeking a stronger host. It takes over Ben Reilly, who had recently replaced Peter Parker as Spider-Man. Reilly has little previous experience with symbiotes, and is unprepared for an enemy that is immune to his spider-sense. Together, they become Spider-Carnage, and the symbiote attempts to force him, both mentally and physically, to kill Peter Parker (then powerless), and other innocent people. The symbiote's will to kill is so strong that Reilly actually has realistic visions of him maiming and killing. In a desperate attempted to control the symbiote, Reilly goes to Ravencroft, to talk to the symbiote's former host Cletus Kasady, who is dying of stomach cancer. When Kasady tells Reilly there is no way to control it, the symbiote tries to get to Kasady, to reform Carnage again. Reilly does not want this to happen and risks his own life, and sanity, to the symbiote, when he tells John Jameson to put him in a cell and lock him up. John then turns on microwave shields in the cell Reilly is in, to try and force the symbiote off. It works but the symbiote slithers off into a sink and goes through the plumbing to re-bond with Cletus Kasady</p><h3>Venom vs Carnage</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"152165\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/152165-112958-carnage_super.jpg\" title=\"Ben Reilly plus Carnage equals Spider-Carnage\"><img id=\"152165\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/152165-112958-carnage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Reilly plus Carnage equals Spider-Carnage\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ben Reilly plus Carnage equals Spider-Carnage</div></div></div></div><p>Carnage starred in the miniseries Venom vs. Carnage, in 2005. The Carnage symbiote spawned a \"child\" symbiote, which he tried to kill without success. The \"child\" later bonded with police officer Patrick Mulligan, which was the host Carnage chose because he was nearest at the time. Carnage had the opportunity to kill the symbiote child then and there however Carnage was exhausted because when he tried to kill his offspring before it got birthed. Carnage felt nothing but hate for the young creature and attempted to kill it, while Venom defended it (oddly enough feeling protective of his \"grandchild\"). Venom named the new symbiote <a href=\"../../toxin/29-40783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toxin</a>. Later Carnage yet again tries to kill Toxin and almost gets away till the <a href=\"../../black-cat/29-1479/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Cat</a> notices Pat Mulligan screaming hanging with an inch of his life on a building with Carnage veering close. Black Cat later stops Carnage and saves Pat Mulligun. Carnage yet again tries to kill Toxin and the Black Cat when Pat Mulligun's symbiote starts to go over him and he stops Carnage. When Toxin realized the power he has, he went off to kill Cletus Kasady and almost succeeded but stopped because he didn't want to sink to his levels. Venom then teams up with Carnage to kill Toxin once and for all, but are both stopped when Toxin, Black Cat, and Spider-Man team up to defeat them. Mulligan has since attempted to steer the symbiote towards heroism instead of murder.</p><h3>Death?</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"478297\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch_super.jpg\" title=\"Carnage ripped in half by Sentry\"><img id=\"478297\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/478297-sentry_kills_carnage_dave_finch_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Carnage ripped in half by Sentry\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Carnage ripped in half by Sentry</div></div></div></div><p>Carnage was one of several super villains trying to escape from The Raft in New Avengers #1-2. However the <a href=\"../../sentry/29-1454/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sentry</a> flew Carnage outside the Earth's atmosphere and ripped him apart. According to <a href=\"../../iron-man/29-1455/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Iron Man</a> 's computer Kasady might not have been inside the symbiote.</p><h3>Return Of Carnage!</h3><p>The Carnage symbiote once thought dead by the hands of Sentry is being held in a containment tank by an unknown organization, who kidnap <a href=\"../../shriek/29-15232/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shriek</a> and lead her to see it.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1636548\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/1636548-carnage_alone_by_heycat_d38170x_super.jpg\" title=\"The Carnage symbiote in a containment tank\"><img id=\"1636548\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/1636548-carnage_alone_by_heycat_d38170x_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Carnage symbiote in a containment tank\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Carnage symbiote in a containment tank</div></div></div></div><p>Shriek appears startled at first, but she may just be shocked that Cletus Kasady may still be alive. Wondering if maybe they will offer her the symbiote suit because of her having been near it longer than anyone else (besides Cletus Kasady) without being ripped to shreds. But so far, they are using Shriek to \"feed\" the symbiote her hate and lust for destruction, which is she has the ability to emit and induce in others. (like how she did in Maximum Carnage to drive the whole city insane with blood lust)</p><p>Later, Cletus Kasady makes a return. When the symbiote takes over <a href=\"../../tanis-nieves/29-10467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tanis Nieves</a> it goes on a rampage, not bonding with her, still sensing Cletus Kasady's presence. Spider-Man and Iron Man believe it to be going for revenge to kill the man who kept it locked up, but instead it went straight for Kasady, who has a new bio-mechanical legs from being ripped in two. The bond between the symbiote and its host was so strong that the symbiote almost starved to death in space just to keep Cletus alive. The symbiote bonded to Kasady once more and Carnage went on a murderous rampage after Michael Hall, but the security of Royal Blue and the rest arrive to stop Carnage. It is later revealed that Michael Hall used parts of the Carnage symbiote to build their suits. Carnage used a mental link to snap the bones and kill the wearers of the suits then he began to merge with the suits just as he did in Planet of the Symbiotes, growing larger and far stronger. Spider-man and Iron Man show up, but by then it's too late.</p><p>The team tries hard to defeat Carnage but things get more difficult when Shriek and Doppleganger make it to the scene. Carnage seems not to care much that Shriek is around and is much more focused on killing then thanking Shriek for saving him at one point. He almost kills Iron Man but is temped more to kill Spider-Man. He is stopped when a part of the symbiote takes over Tanis and transforms into Scorn. Scorn makes Shriek aim a sonic scream at Carnage, knocking him down. He is then beaten violently and torn into by Spider-Man attacking him with a street meter but manages to escape before Spider-Man can get through the giant suit.</p><p>Later it turns out Cletus is hiding in a beach house with Doppleganger watching TV and plotting a comeback.</p><h3>Carnage USA</h3><p>In the small American town of Doverton, Colorado, Carnage returns. After consuming the all the meat and staff in the local meat packing factory, the symbiote infects the town by appearing through the sinks and drains. Cletus makes his demands by carving them into a hostage - he wants the town to become a symbiote state, his own country.</p><p>A team of heroes; <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"/hawkeye/29-1475/\">Hawkeye</a> and <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> - are lead by <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-man</a> to make contact with Carnage. When they arrive, they find Cletus holding all the towns people hostage, and his symbiote wrapped around all their necks.</p><p>When Thing uses a sonic weapon on Carnage, it results in the heroes becoming infected with the bloodthirsty symbiote, and facing off with Spiderman.</p><p>With the heroes out of action, the government turns to its other contigency plans; <a href=\"/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a>, <a href=\"/toxin/29-40783/\">Toxin</a>, <a href=\"/hybrid/29-24129/\">Hybrid</a>, <a href=\"/scorn/29-10467/\">Scorn</a> and <a href=\"/eddie-brock/29-6733/\">Anti-Venom</a>.</p><p>Spiderman escapes his symbiote infected allies, as Carnage uses them like puppets against him. He is rescued by townsfolk who have avoided Carnage, and they use molotov fire bombs to make their getaway from the town center, to their base on a fenced, private zoo.</p><p>Meanwhile the government send in soldiers who have been enhanced with symbiotes, and their mission is to stop Carnage and rescue the civilians before the town is bombed to save the world from Carnages outbreak. Scorn is also deployed to stop Carnage, but she spends time in her base melding her symbiote with mechanical devices around herself.</p><p>Spider-man rallies the un-infected towns folk, they are going to make an attack against Carnage in a last ditch effort to save the town. The symbiote-soldiers are already in the town, fighting off waves of symbiote infected people. As they are running out of ammo, Carnage and the Avengers team he is controlling come out to face them. It looks like the soldiers are doomed, but Spider-man and the townsfolk arrive and attack Carnage with more molotovs.</p><p>Whilst wrestling with Spider-man, Carnage gains the upper hand and is about to carve out Spider-mans eyes, when <a href=\"/flash-thompson/29-1489/\">Venom</a> (as Flash Thompson) jumps in and rescues Spider-man by shooting Carnage with sonic bullets.</p><p>Venom is winning the fight against Carnage, and is ready to kill him until Spider-man stops him and Carnage gains control over the Avengers team again. Venom and Carnage are ready to fight again, but suddenly an improvised truck, controlled by the <a href=\"/scorn/29-10467/\">Scorn</a>s mechanically fused symbiote, catches both Venom and Carnage, and puts them in a glass tank that removes their symbiotes.</p><p>Flash recovers, and is left in his legless human form with Cletus Cassidy standing over him with a shard of glass, ready to kill Flash.</p><p>The symbiotes go rogue, and manage to find zoo animals that escaped from a private reserve and bond to them. The Venom symbiote bonds to a gorilla, while the Carnage symbiote bonds to several monkeys, a few giraffes, and even a lion.</p><p>Meanwhile, Cletus's bionic legs fall apart due to the glass tank affecting the symbiotic circuitry. Flash and Cletus have a brutal fight, impaling each other with meat hooks and glass.</p><p>With help from the Avengers and Scorn, the Venom symbiote gorilla makes it's way back to Flash, leaving the gorilla and bonding to him again. Flash takes advantage of Cletus's lost limbs and easily wins the confrontation, but doesn't kill Cletus.</p><p>After the government changes plans to bomb the entire town and switches to a localized assault - killing the zoo animal Carnage symbiotes - Scorn collects the last remaining remnant of the Carnage symbiote for an unknown second objective.</p><p>The assault on the zoo animal symbiotes leaves the town devastated.</p><p>Meanwhile, Flash brings Cletus in alive. He tells Captain America that he wouldn't be able to face Spider-man had he killed him, Cap assures him that Cletus was meant to be brought in alive.</p><p>Cletus and the symbiote are then taken from the town and into custody.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>The Carnage symbiote possesses the standard abilities of his <a href=\"../../symbiotes/65-56880/\" rel=\"nofollow\">species</a>; however, he was born much stronger than his parent symbiote: Venom. He possesses great super-human strength, speed, stamina, healing and resistance to injury. He also is equipped with the ability the ability to scale up the side of walls and shoot razor sharp symbiote projectiles(only these projectiles only last for around ten seconds before crumbling to dust in a similar manner to Venom\u2019s webbing). In \"Amazing Spider-Man\" #362 (May, 1992), he was described as having greater physical strength than those of Spider-Man and Venom \"combined\". He possesses strength sufficient to lift 35-50 tons. <i>However, it should be noted that since spawning Carnage, Venom has bonded with other super-humans and further increased its strength (ie.</i> <i>Mac Gargan</i>).</p><p>He usually travels around in a similar fashion to Spider-Man, firing web-style extensions of his hand to swing around. Cletus can generate \"snares\" to trap or entangle foes in a very similar way as Spider-Man. His main characteristic that separates him from Venom is his ability to form sharp weapons resembling spikes, giant claws, and axes from his body and hands and using them to stab or shred any innocent person he sees. His symbiote can also mimic most things to perfection and developed the power to block Venom\u2019s ability to track his offspring. He is totally protected from regular caliber bullets and most weapons.</p><p>He is at his best when fighting Spider-Man. Carnage's special abilities allow him to basically nullify Parker's Spider-Sense, proving to be a serious hindrance to the Web-Slinger. Cletus even has the ability to simply nick or cut himself in a small way and turn into Carnage because the Symbiote is in his blood stream. It would also seem that when Carnage consumes or eats other symbiotes as he did in Planet of the Symbiotes, he would grow gigantic. He truly is one of Spider-Man's most feared adversaries.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2270197\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14.jpg\" title=\"The Carnage symbiote destroyed; Cletus Kasady unconscious\"><img id=\"2270197\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11136/2270197-cletus-kasady-spiderman-4-i14_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Carnage symbiote destroyed; Cletus Kasady unconscious\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Carnage symbiote destroyed; Cletus Kasady unconscious</div></div></div></div><p><strong>Weaknesses</strong></p><p>The Carnage symbiote is highly vulnerable to intense heat. Extreme sound can also damage the symbiote, but to a lesser extent than other symbiotes. While the Carnage symbiote has been able to endure sonic waves and sound-based attacks and weaponry, fire has always proven very effective against Carnage. Microwave energy can cause the symbiote great pain and can even tear the symbiote away from Cletus. Without the symbiote, Cletus possesses no superhuman powers.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><ul><li><b>Height</b>: 6' 1\"(Kasady); 6'9 1/2\" (Variable, with symbiote)</li><li><b>Weight</b>: 190 lbs (Kasady); 300 lbs (Variable, with symbiote)</li><li><b>Eyes</b>: Green, White (Carnage)</li><li><b>Hair</b>: Red, None (Carnage)</li><li><b>Place of birth</b>: Brooklyn, New York</li></ul><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-1610 (Ultimate)</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"104264\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/104264-327-carnage_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultimate Carnage\"><img id=\"104264\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/104264-327-carnage_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ultimate Carnage\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultimate Carnage</div></div></div></div><p>The Ultimate universes version of Carnage came into being when Curt Connors combined the DNA sequences found in a sample of Spider-Man's blood with DNA sequences found in Richard Parker's research (presumably on the project that created the original Venom symbiote).

In it's wake it leaves a trail of corpses that have been completely drained of their blood.

He was generally rude and very much disliked the team leader, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sabretooth/29-4563/\">Sabretooth</a>.</p><p>When Spider and Weapon X arrived on the home universe of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/david-richards/29-59369/\">David Richards</a> (an alternate version of the villain called Hyperstorm), he noticed that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exiles/65-19986/\">Exiles</a> had arrived there as well. Unlike those who comprised The Exiles, Spider was not shocked to discover that there was another reality hopping team like Weapon X, though he was surprised to learn that <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sasquatch/29-1478/\">Sasquatch</a> was a woman named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heather-hudson/29-9846/\">Heather Hudson</a>. He had no problem showing his identity as Peter Parker, as he was seen moving around without a mask. Spider helped the Exiles with rescuing this kid named David Richards. After they rescued the boy and all of the other children, Sabretooth was having a fight with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> about killing David Richards. Spider told everybody that both teams will stay if they don't kill David Richards and it would be their best interest to kill him and get on with everyone's lives. When Sabretooth abandoned the team and killed Deadpool, Spider ordered the rest of Weapon X to kill him, which quickly erupted into an all-out battle between Weapon X and The Exiles. It was then that The Timebroker appeared, hoping to end the conflict, only to be assaulted by Spider. However, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mimic/29-12546/\">Mimic</a> managed to halt Spider's attack before Spider could \"kill\" him. The Exiles then proposed a compromise; Sabretooth was to stay and raise David Richards in the hopes that he could prevent him from becoming another Hyperstorm and both teams move on with their missions.</p><p>An alternate reality <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> was made the new leader of Weapon X, something that did not please Spider at all. Spider's next big mission was in reality where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a> ruled as a dictator. Their mission was to help Iron Man in destroying the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inhumans/65-11427/\">Inhumans</a>. The problem was that Attilan was protected by an energy shield and the only key to penetrate it was in the hands of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>. But the Wonder Man of this reality was far different from any other incarnation they might have encountered before, he had absorbed gamma particles when Hulk died and his strength grew enormously. Weapon X infiltrated his mansion and planed to steal the device to lower Inhumans' shield, but were discovered. A fight quickly broke loose; Spider thought to convince Wonder Man to surrender by threatening <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-witch/29-1466/\">Scarlet Witch</a>, his wife. That however made Wonder Man angry, and he Hulked-out. Now seeing no other option, Gambit activated portable <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-negative-zone/34-40699/\">Negative Zone</a> portal. When Wonder Man still hanged on, Gambit ordered <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a> to push him in, reassuring that Spider will toss her a web. Spider however refused to do so, and both Hulks disappeared into to portal. When Gambit lashed out at him for abandoning She-Hulk, Spider defended himself by saying that the combined weight of She-Hulk and the hulked-out Wonder Man would have resulted in him being dragged into The Negative Zone as well. Spider also pointed out that it was Gambit, not he, who had promised to cast She-Hulk a lifeline. Following Spiders explanation, a new member arrived to take She-Hulk's place, namely <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a>, but the time for mixing and mingling would have to wait for they had a job to do. After handing the device over to Iron Man, they supervised the attack on The Inhumans, but did not see the trap that had been prepared for their arrival until it was too late. However, before any harm could come to them, Spider and his teammates were spirited away to another reality.</p><p>Sometime later on one specific mission to kill <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">Bruce Banner</a>, where Spider had been placed in charge of keeping the soldiers from entering the facility while <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a> (who had replaced The Angel at some point during their journey) proceeded with killing Bruce Banner. Colossus protested against the killings and wanted to seek other options to complete the missions. Spider and Colossus began to argue over their way of doing things but both were stopped by The Vision, who ended the debate once and for all by stating that killing their targets was the only way to ensure that they truly completed their missions. As this occurred Gambit was comforting <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>; who had been mortally wounded during an earlier fight, and was desperately trying to keep her alive. But she soon gave into the darkness and with her last breath, asked to be buried in a forest and not left behind in the factory amongst those they had killed. With the crunch of Banner's skull, Weapon X was then spirited away to another reality to complete yet another mission, apparently leaving Storm to rot in the factory, not that Spider or anyone else other than Gambit cared.</p><p>Upon arriving in a ruined version of The Xavier Institute, Spider and Weapon X found their newest member, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/king-hyperion/29-62056/\">King Hyperion</a>, waiting for them. Their new assignment was to kill the last ten Mutants who managed to survive the Mutant Holocaust instigated by an army of Sentinels under the control of The United Nations. Hyperion opposed those orders and wanted to rule the world instead, a proclamation that made even Spider take a minute to think about. Spider then spoke up and asked if he would be allowed to kill ten humans, Hyperion said that he could kill as many as he wanted so long as he remained loyal. Spider immediately sided with Hyperion and became very attached to the ex-God Emperor. Together they tried to convince the mutants of that reality to side with Hyperion and aid him in conquering the world, but most of them refused. It was only after the deaths of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> that everyone including a reluctant Storm agreed to join Hyperion in his quest to conquer the world. There was a minor problem though, Magneto had sent a massive asteroid to Earth a few hours prior to his encounter with Hyperion and had refused to stop it even after being tortured by Hyperion. Despite Hyperion's attempts to halt the asteroid's descent, he failed and the Earth died. With Earth dead, Hyperion saw that it was pointless to remain in that reality and began systematically killing all of the Mutants off. Spider managed to strike <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vanisher/29-6756/\">Vanisher</a> through the heart and was attacked by Gambit who, along with Storm, teleported to another side of Asteroid M with the dying Vanisher.</p><p>Spider later reappeared at Hyperion's side, opposite of Ms. Marvel, along with the two newest additions to Weapon X: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulk/29-2267/\">The Hulk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a> and commended Gambit for \"seeing the light.\" As their journey progressed, Gambit started to lie to Hyperion about the mission objectives and tricked him into thinking that the worlds they had traveled to were not worth conquering thus compelling them to complete the missions. But Hyperion eventually caught on and blasted Gambit's arm off with his atomic heat vision in an attempt to take The Tallus for himself. When The Hulk tried to kill Hyperion, Spider managed to latch a web onto his arm and pulled his attention away from Hyperion long enough for the madman to recover. With Spider and Ms. Marvel's aid, Hyperion overwhelmed the two and then moved onto bigger targets like The Fantastic Five and The Avengers. Spider later built a large web in Times Square from which the corpses of Earth-4400's heroes and the semi-conscious Hulk and Firestar were strung up on for all to see and was then sent on a reconnaissance mission to find The Exiles. When The Exiles appeared, Spider rushed back to Hyperion's side and told him of their arrival. Later, when he learned that only six survivors would be allowed to move onto the next reality, Spider tried to kill Firestar despite Hyperion's protests and was incinerated. His ashes along with the corpses of Magik, Ms. Marvel, Firestar, Hulk and Hyperion were brought to The Panoptichron and sealed away inside a wall of crystal containing the bodies of every Weapon X and Exile member who had ever died or been rendered comatose such as Heather Hudson, Thunderbird and, surprisingly enough, King Hyperion).</p><p>When Exiles discovered that the bodies can be released from the crystal wall, they sent all of them back to their own reality. Spider's body was buried in the prison graveyard.</p><h3>Earth-985</h3><p>In this reality the Carnage symbiote bonded with <a href=\"../../silver-surfer/29-2502/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Surfer</a>.

When he knew that the Carnage symbiote will likely to control him again, he flew towards the sun, destroying them both.</p><h3>Earth-982</h3><p>In the MC2 universe, <a href=\"../../spider-girl/29-3365/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spider-Girl</a> accidentally released the Carnage symbiote from its containment being care by <a href=\"../../shield/65-3775/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SHIELD</a>. It bonded to May's friend Moose Mansfield. Carnage later kidnapped May's father and baby brother, Peter and <a href=\"../../benjy-parker/29-46523/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benjy</a>, respectively, who was later become possessed by the symbiote and became a little version of Carnage. Spider-Girl manage to kill the symbiote by using a sonic weapon of <a href=\"../../reverb/29-25523/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reverb</a>, but also caused his little brother to become deaf.

Players could play as both Spider-Man and Venom throughout the game.</p><h4>Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety</h4><p>In the sequel to Maximum Carnage, the symbiote family teams up to defeat Carnage. The game's title is misleading, as the events more closely follow the Venom: Lethal Protector story arc.</p><h4>Spider-Man (2000 video game for Playstation and Nintendo 64)</h4><p>In the 2000 Spider-Man video game, Carnage helped <a href=\"../../doctor-octopus/29-1485/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doctor Octopus</a> spread symbiotes all over the city. When you fight Carnage you must pull him into the sound barrier with your webbing and attack him while he is weakened. At the end of the game you have to run away from monster Dr. Octopus that is the new host to the Carnage symbiote upon defeating Kasady.</p><h4><b>Ultimate Spider-Man Game</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"517963\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/517963-104271_184649_carnage_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Carnage in Ultimate Spider-Man the video game.\"><img id=\"517963\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26114/517963-104271_184649_carnage_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Carnage in Ultimate Spider-Man the video game.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Carnage in Ultimate Spider-Man the video game.</div></div></div></div><p>In the Ultimate Spider-Man game, Carnage is actually Peter Parker. A man named <a href=\"../../bolivar-trask/29-15923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trask</a> is trying to control the Venom symbiote and at some point he realizes that Peter's blood has bonds with the Venom serum (since his father used his own DNA to make the serum). Trask sets the suit free in hopes of it capturing Spider-Man. When they find Venom and Spider-Man they capture them by sending <a href=\"../../silver-sable/29-7608/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silver Sable</a> after them, who shoots them both with strong tranquilizer darts. When Peter wakes up he is strapped to a table and a man named <a href=\"../../vulture/29-4459/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tooms</a> is talking to him. He is explaining that the serum is part of Peter and that they are going to speed up the growth process by injecting more of the serum into Peter's blood. When the serum gets injected into Peter he screams in pain then suddenly bursts free from the table, becoming Carnage! Playing as Venom you must battle it out with Carnage. After a long fought battle Carnage is cornered in a room where the <a href=\"../../rhino/29-2126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.H.I.N.O</a> suit was being designed. Venom and Carnage continue to fight while maintaining life by feeding on the various guards in the room. Venom finally beats Carnage and immediately feeds on him, stripping Peter of the Venom particles in his system and giving Eddie control of the Venom suit.</p><h4>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2</h4><p>Carnage was a playable character via downloadable content on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. Carnage has many neat attacks in the game: he can throw axes, enlarge his head, and send tendrils out to attack enemies. You rank up for killing enemies. Carnage also had a rather animalistic semi-quadropedal movement style. As of December 31, 2010, Carnage will no longer be available for download because Activision allowed its rights to Marvel's intellectual properties to lapse.</p><h4><b>Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions</b></h4><p>Ultimate Carnage is the final boss for the Ultimate universe. The level opens with Ultimate Spider-Man reaching out to SHIELD to see if they can help locate the last fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos. Instead, he discovers that Carnage has just escaped from the SHIELD prison and is using the fragment to turn SHIELD agents into symbiotic zombies. Spider-Man must pursue Carnage through the facility, fighting off Carnage's minions and the few SHIELD units that remain. During the initial fight with Carnage, it is revealed that the symbiote is vulnerable to fire. After dodging a crashing SHIELD helicarrier, Spider-Man must climb to the top of a tower for the final showdown against Carnage, where SHIELD units help by providing fire support.</p><h4>Spider-Man the Animated Series</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"822926\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6434/822926-carnage_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"822926\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6434/822926-carnage_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Carnage appears as Cletus Kasady but is seen as a mad man more then a serial killer.

Eventually Spider-Men from different dimensions, including Peter Parker, are commissioned by the Beyonder and Madamme Web to go on a mission to defeat Spider-Carnage. They ultimately end up stopping the super-poweful Carnage possessed Ben Reilly from destroying all of reality with the help of Uncle Ben. Possibly out of grief, Ben Reilly jumps into the inter-dimensional vortex, killing himself and the Carnage symbiote, at the last second before the vortex disappears into oblivion.</p><h4>Spider-Man Unlimited</h4><p>Carnage appears as one of the main villains in the series and is working with Venom. They had a plan to get the world infected with symbiotes. Later in the series Venom, and Carnage fuse together but are later beaten by Spider-Man.</p><h4>Spectacular Spider-Man</h4><p>Cletus Kasady only appears in a small cameo here. He is never seen as Carnage. During the second season, he is at Ravencroft Institute for the Criminally Insane in a group seminar with other super villains such as Electro and Doctor Octopus.</p><h4>Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark</h4><p>Carnage appears in the 2011 musical as a member of Green Goblin's Sinister Six.

Ten years after coming to K'un-Lun, was showing Shakari the restored nexus when Yu-Ti's men attacked them. Shakari was slain, and the grief-stricken Wendall returned to Earth. Within a year, he became a successful businessman and married <a href=\"../../wikid/silver-dragon/29-60347/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heather Duncan</a>. In his absence, Lord Tuan died and became ruler of Feng-Tu, abode of K'un-Lun's departed spirits, leaving Yu-Ti to rule K'un-Lun, while Lei Kung, shamed by Davos' defeat, banished his son to Earth.</p><p>When Daniel Rand was nine, at roughly the time K'un-Lun was scheduled to materialize, his father decided to bring him and Heather to K'un-Lun. Accompanied by Rand's business partner <a href=\"/harold-meachum/29-36421/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harold Meachum</a>, they traveled to the Himalayas, but Wendell fell from a mountain ledge; clutching the edge, he called to Meachum for help, but Meachum, hoping to control Rand's business shares, caused Wendell to plunge to his death. Shortly afterward, Heather sacrificed her life to protect Daniel from a wolf pack, and her spirit ascended to Feng-Tu. The denizens of K'un-Lun found Daniel and took him in, while a frostbite-crippled Meachum learned of Daniel's survival and spent the next decade preparing elaborate defenses against future attack.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"769751\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35011/769751-shoulao2.png\" title=\"\"><img id=\"769751\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/35011/769751-shoulao2_medium.png\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Vowing to avenge his parents, Daniel Rand studied martial arts under Lei Kung the Thunderer, while growing up in K'un-Lun. His closest friends were Miranda Rand-K'ai, whom he did not know was his half-sister, and a K'un-Lun boy named <a href=\"/sharyd/29-23382/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conal D'hu-Tsien</a>. At nineteen, requested and earned an opportunity to win the power of the Iron Fist by confronting Shou-Lao the Undying, whose power resided within a flaming brazier. slew Shou-Lao, a feat no other warrior had ever accomplished, by pressing his chest to the dragon's, cutting it off from the life energy it absorbed from it's heart, which resided in a nearby brazier. This resulted in a dragon-shaped brand on his chest. He then plunged his hands into the brazier containing the dragon's heart, and gained the power of the Iron Fist.</p><p>Shou-Lao's death angered Chiantang<a href=\"../../wikid/black-dragon/29-21590/\" rel=\"nofollow\">,</a> who sought to destroy K'un-Lun in response but was imprisoned by Master Khan. Shortly afterward, fought off jealous peers with the aid of Conal and Miranda, whom Conal had taught martial arts in defiance of K'un-Lun law. Fleeing K'un-Lun, Miranda and Conal were captured by K'un-Lun's ancestral enemies, the plant-beings called the <a href=\"http://marvel.com/universe3zx/index.php?title=H%27lythri&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">H'lythri</a><u>,</u> and presumed dead. The dimensional nexus opened on schedule, and, as Iron Fist, traveled to, seeking vengeance on Meachum. Meachum knew of Danny's return and placed a bounty of ten thousand dollars on his head. The open contract left open to attacks from other costumed menaces such as the man called <a href=\"../../scythe/29-21215/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scythe</a>. Iron Fist eventually overcame Meachum's defenses, but on seeing Meachum was an invalid, he spared the broken man.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"101119\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2195/101119-157291-iron-fist_super.JPG\" title=\"\"><img id=\"101119\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2195/101119-157291-iron-fist_medium.JPG\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Meachum was instead slain by the ghostly Ninja, a servant of Master Khan. Blamed for the murder, Iron Fist eventually cleared himself with the help of two private detectives he befriended, samurai-trained <a href=\"../../colleen-wing/29-1494/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Colleen Wing</a> and cyborg ex-cop <a href=\"../../misty-knight/29-1491/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Misty Knight</a>.

In the process, he learned that the Ninja was using Colleen Wing's father, Lee, as a host; Iron Fist ended this magical possession.</p><p>Soon afterward, Iron Fist fought the Steel Serpent, a master martial artist specializing in the delayed death touch. The Serpent had twice in the past been defeated by Yu-Ti in attempts to take over K'un Lun, and he fell victim to his own power during his assault on Iron Fist. Rand then encountered a woman named <a href=\"http://marvel.com/universe3zx/index.php?title=Jade_%28embodiment%29&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jade</a> and defended her from agents of <a href=\"../../dhasha-khan/29-35785/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dhasha Khan</a>, a demonic warrior sorcerer who had conquered Feng-Tu; however, more of Khan's agents abducted Iron Fist and Jade, whom Iron Fist learned was the embodiment of humanity's nobility, her soul bonded with the cosmic <a href=\"/firebird/29-3323/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firebird</a>. Iron Fist was defeated by Khan's enslaved warrior, the Silver Dragon, while Khan used his mystic <a href=\"../../wikid/soul-gem/18-55645/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Soulgem</a> to rob Jade of the Firebird, which he used to transform Earth. Iron Fist defeated the Silver Dragon and discovered she was the spirit of his mother, Heather Rand. Iron Fist then defeated Khan in battle, using the Soulgem to restore Earth and return his mother to a peaceful afterlife. Although he had fallen in love with Jade and wished she could remain mortal, he knew that humanity needed the Firebird, and he used the Soulgem to restore Jade.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"95330\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2195/95330-17378-iron-fist_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"95330\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2195/95330-17378-iron-fist_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Over the next few months, Iron Fist became a noted crime fighter and clashed with enemies such as Master Khan, <a href=\"/scimitar/29-3429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scimitar</a>, <a href=\"/chaka/29-35462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chaka</a>, the <a href=\"/wrecking-crew/65-18519/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wrecking Crew</a>, <a href=\"/drom-the-backwards-man/29-59248/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Drom, the Backwards Man</a> and <a href=\"/sabretooth/29-4563/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sabretooth</a>.

Also calling himself Steel Serpent, Davos briefly succeeded in usurping the power before losing it back to and being defeated by Iron Fist; his soul was imprisoned within the alien <a href=\"../../wikid/contemplator/29-13988/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contemplator</a>'s Anomaly Gem.</p><h2>Mayor Story Arcs</h2><h3>Heroes for Hire</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"344826\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire_super.jpg\" title=\"Heroes for Hire\"><img id=\"344826\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/344826-15038-heroes-for-hire_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes for Hire\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heroes for Hire</div></div></div></div><p>Iron Fist became Misty Knight's lover; he defended her from Luke Cage, a super-strong mercenary blackmailed into serving Knight's enemy, <a href=\"/bushmaster/29-30720/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bushmaster</a>. Iron Fist, Knight, and Colleen Wing helped Cage break Bushmaster's hold, and Iron Fist soon formed a partnership with Cage as <a href=\"/heroes-for-hire/65-23588/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heroes for Hire</a>, taking assignments as bodyguards and private investigators. While Iron Fist and the cynically down-to-earth Cage were very different, they shared a dedication to justice and became best friends. Soon, Iron Fist and Cage confronted Master Khan, whom they pursued to K'un-Lun. Reunited with Lei Kung, Iron Fist was appalled to learn that the population had been decimated by the H'ylthri, and he and Cage led K'un-Lun's remaining warriors against their foes; however, Iron Fist's time on Earth had changed him, and he became disillusioned by K'un-Lun's regimented culture. He was then captured by his adoptive uncle, Yu-Ti, who hoped to use him to appease Master Khan; however, even Khan feared the full power of the Iron Fist and was threatened into releasing his enemies. Iron Fist destroyed the mystic emerald that stabilized K'un-Lun's link to Earth, making future interfaces unpredictable, then returned to with Cage. Khan himself became trapped on Earth and was unable to prevent Chiantang from escaping and almost destroying K'un-Lun.</p><p>Khan later enlisted Ward Meachum, Cage's enemies <a href=\"../../wikid/shades/29-11015/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shades</a> and <a href=\"/comanche/29-34965/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Comanche</a>, and <a href=\"../../wikid/ferocia/29-42051/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fera</a> in a plot against Iron Fist; Fera was actually one of the wolves who had slain Heather Rand, granted human form via the magical power of Shirrair and enslaved by Master Khan. Khan used the Power Gem of Quon to steal Iron Fist's power and life force, nearly killing him; but with the aid of Cage, Misty, Colleen, the vigilante <a href=\"/el-aguila/29-32736/\">el Aguila</a>, and policeman <a href=\"/lt-rafael-scarfe/29-36086/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rafe Scarfe</a>, Iron Fist regained his power and banished Khan again. Many months later, Iron Fist and Cage befriended <a href=\"/captain-hero/29-10298/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bobby Wright</a>, a troubled boy who could transform into the superhuman Captain Hero; unknown to them, \"Wright\" was the <a href=\"/super-skrull/29-21332/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Super-Skrull</a>, a powerful alien whom Master Khan had mesmerized into befriending Iron Fist. Meanwhile, Khan himself usurped the form of police officer Tyrone King and began romancing Misty Knight to undermine his enemy.</p><p>Shortly afterward, Iron Fist was exposed to deadly radiation and, accompanied by Cage and Wing, he returned to K'un-Lun.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"344829\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire_super.jpg\" title=\"Iron Fist dead?\"><img id=\"344829\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/344829-89588-heroes-for-hire_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Iron Fist dead?\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Iron Fist dead?</div></div></div></div><p>Instructed in the use of his healing power by Lei Kung, Iron Fist learned that Chiantang's attack had been in response to Shou-Lao's death and became overwhelmed with guilt, but recovered with the help of his friends, who banished Chiantang. Preparing to return to Earth, Iron Fist was secretly ambushed by the H'ylthri, who sent a duplicate, believing itself to be Iron Fist, in his place. As for Chiantang, he too appeared on Earth, where Khan, as Tyrone King, slew him; however, even Khan was unaware of the H'ylthri's substitution. Shortly afterward, the Iron Fist duplicate attempted to heal \"Bobby Wright\", who was supposedly dying; the attempt seemed successful, but \"Wright\" suffered a relapse and, as Captain Hero, beat the duplicate to death in a rage. Khan, believing his enemy dead, then dismissed the Super-Skrull and eventually abandoned his King identity, leaving Cage to take the blame for the death of \"Iron Fist\".</p><h3>Resurrection</h3><p>For months the true Iron Fist remained the H'ylthri's captive. While in stasis manages to focus his chi, curing the cancer. But when the Super-Skrull impersonated Iron Fist himself, Knight and Wing learned that the \"Iron Fist\" they had buried had reverted to plant-like remains. Following the Super-Skrull's defeat by <a href=\"/namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor the Sub-Mariner</a>, Knight and Wing brought Namor to K'un-Lun, where they rescued Iron Fist. Soon afterward, Iron Fist helped Cage defeat Bushmaster again, but while Cage was pleased to see his friend alive, he was uninterested in re-forming Heroes for Hire. When Master Khan vengefully rendered Namor amnesiac, Iron Fist helped Knight and others find Namor, restore his memory and confront Khan, whom Namor apparently slew.</p><p>Iron Fist went on to aid other heroes against threats such as the mystic <a href=\"/legion-of-vengeance/65-56638/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Vengeance</a>, the feral mutant Sabretooth, and the forces of the mutated serial killer <a href=\"../../wikid/carnage/29-1490/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnage</a>. When he began to lose faith in himself, the Contemplator realized Iron Fist's inner turmoil was upsetting the cosmic balance through his link to Shou-Lao's power. He had Iron Fist reassemble the Anomaly Gem, shattered during the H'ylthri invasion; this resurrected the Steel Serpent, who stole 's power and tried to conquer K'un-Lun. Given new purpose per the Contemplator's plan, Iron Fist battled Steel Serpent and reclaimed his power, then renewed his relationship with Misty Knight. Months later, when 's most prominent super heroes were seemingly slain by the psychic entity <a href=\"/onslaught/29-13352/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Onslaught</a>, Iron Fist resolved to give the world hope and mystically bound himself to K'un-Lun, hoping to bring it to Earth and remake the world.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"405933\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/405933-181536-heroes-for-hire_super.jpg\" title=\"New team\"><img id=\"405933\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/405933-181536-heroes-for-hire_medium.jpg\" alt=\"New team\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">New team</div></div></div></div><p>After Namor the Sub-Mariner's Oracle, INC bought out Rand-Meachum, Iron Fist gained funding and formed an expanded version of Heroes for Hire, recruiting <a href=\"../../wikid/hercules/29-2503/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hercules</a>, the <a href=\"../../wikid/black-knight/29-3172/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Knight</a> and others to fight with him and Luke Cage, and to renew people's confidence in heroes. This team reunited him with Cage, though the group proved to be temporary; the members were less than pleased when Namor sold Oracle (and by extension Heroes for Hire) to Stark-Fujikawa. After their new employers fired Cage and <a href=\"/ant-man-lang/29-20577/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ant-Man</a> (Scott Lang) for their prison records, the remaining members disbanded. Weeks later, Iron Fist was manipulated into stealing the powerful <a href=\"/zodiac-key/18-51532/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zodiac Key</a> by Death Sting, actually Miranda Rand-K'ai, who, along with Conal, had been pressed into H'ylthri service. Iron Fist fought the pair and their H'ylthri masters, and both Death Sting and Conal were believed slain, although Death Sting survived.</p><p>Meanwhile, the heroes supposedly slain by Onslaught had returned, and Iron Fist, belatedly realizing that humanity would reject rule by K'un-Lun, sought to stop the process he had begun; but young Hand assassin <a href=\"/junzo-muto/29-21192/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Junzo Muto</a> stole his power in order to bring K'un-Lun to . Heather Rand's spirit told Iron Fist that Muto could not succeed without him, leaving K'un-Lun to move on to an unknown fate. Unwilling to risk K'un-Lun's destruction, Iron Fist teamed with <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wolverine</a>, Yu-Ti and others to defeat Muto, but not before K'un-Lun began to merge with the city of. Yu-Ti then stabbed Iron Fist, reasoning that his death would separate the cities. K'un-Lun indeed returned to its proper place, but Iron Fist was met in Feng-Tu by his proud parents, who restored him to life.</p><p>Back in New York , former Heroes for Hire foe Nightshade resurrected Chiantang to use him against her current enemy, the <a href=\"/black-panther/29-1477/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Panther</a>. Chiantang turned on her, re-empowered Iron Fist, and mentally enslaved him to fight the Panther, but Iron Fist regained his senses and helped defeat Chiantang. Returning to crime fighting, he found it unsatisfying and left to seek a new path. Yet all paths, it seemed, led back to K'un-Lun, for he soon faced Chi, a sorcerer exiled from K'un-Lun a millennium before, who hoped to use Iron Fist's unique bond to K'un-Lun for conquest. Iron Fist defeated Chi, accepting his heroic role anew.</p><h3>Civil War and Daredevil</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"190697\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist.jpg\" title=\"As Daredevil\"><img id=\"190697\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5922/190697-115721-iron-fist_medium.jpg\" alt=\"As Daredevil\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">As Daredevil</div></div></div></div><p>When Matt Murdock was exposed as <a href=\"../../daredevil/29-24694/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daredevil</a> and put in jail, Danny was hired to dress and act as Daredevil to create the illusion that he and Murdock were two separate people.

Rebelling against his rabbi father, Marc Spector started out as a heavyweight boxer before eventually joining the U.S. Marines. After this period in his life, Marc took the skills he acquired from the Marine Corps and went on to become a fierce mercenary. In Africa, he met a French mercenary, Jean-Paul \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/frenchie/29-27829/\">Frenchie</a>\" DuChamp, who would become one of Marc's closest friends. Frenchie later became Marc's pilot. While working for terrorist, Raoul <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bushman/33235/\">Bushman</a>, Marc began to question his choices. In Selima, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sudan/34-56030/\">Sudan,</a> they stumbled across archaeologist Dr. Peter Alraune's excavation of an Egyptian Pharaoh's tomb. There, Bushman killed the archaeologist. Marc, feeling guilty, attempted to help Alraune's daughter, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marlene-alraune/29-33191/\">Marlene Alraune</a>, escape. Annoyed with Marc's betrayal, Bushman beat Spector and left him in the desert to die. Barely conscious, Spector managed to return to the ancient tomb. Marlene was there with her father's men and brought Marc to rest near a statue of the moon god, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/khonshu/29-42387/\">Khonshu</a>. Weak from his fight with Bushman and the elements of the desert, Spector died. As Marlene cried over his body, Spector suddenly came back to life. It was his belief that Khonshu had brought him back from the dead in order to be the moon's Knight of Vengeance. Spector removed a cloak from the statue of Khonshu and confronted Bushman again, and this time, he came out of the encounter victorious, and thus Moon Knight was born. Returning to the United States with Marlene and Frenchie, the trio decided to fight a war against evil. Spector used his vast fortune that he had collected during his mercenary days to create some aliases to infiltrate different aspects of society. One persona was that of Steven Grant, a New York millionaire. In the guise of Grant, Spector was able to make high profile contacts. Spector also created the persona of Jake Lockley, a New York cab driver. Through Lockley, he was able to make several contacts \"on the streets.\" It appeared that the act of juggling the different persona's put a strain on Spector's mental health.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The Hero of the Night rises</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"236692\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11233/236692-54051_super.jpg\" title=\"Lunar Legionnaire\"><img id=\"236692\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11233/236692-54051_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lunar Legionnaire\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lunar Legionnaire</div></div></div></div><p>When Moon Knight was just beginning his acts of heroism in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-york-city/34-41183/\">New York City</a>, a group of aristocrats known as \"<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-committee/29-36050/\">The Committee</a>\", hired Marc to capture and retrieve Jack Russell, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/werewolf-by-night/29-4984/\">Werewolf By Night</a>. They intended to use Jack as a weapon to fulfill their desire to rule the city. Moon Knight, realizing what the far more righteous route would be, proceeded to release Jack and defeat \"The Committee\". He later joined the superhero team, the Defenders, to defeat the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/life-model-decoy/18-42286/\">Life Model Decoys</a> of a villain group, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/zodiac/65-41170/\">Zodiac</a>. Afterward, Moon Knight encountered villains that would become part of his own rogue gallery, such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/morpheus/29-13927/\">Morpheus</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-spectre/29-36456/\">Black Spectre</a>, just to name a few. And also at the same time team-up with other heroes such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> and Daredevil.</p><h3>The Fist of Khonshu</h3><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-west-coast/65-29075/\">Avengers West Coast</a> got trapped in ancient <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/egypt/34-55877/\">Egypt</a>, Khonshu warned Moon Knight about the danger the team faced and he was able return the Avengers to the present. Moon Knight then joined the Avengers West Coast. He also became possessed by Khonshu which gave the powers based on the ever-changing phases of the moon. These newfound supernatural powers alienated his longtime friends, Frenchie and Marlene. Moon Knight even had a relationship with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tigra/29-21188/\">Tigra</a> that lasted until he resigned. Moon Knight, Tigra and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mockingbird/29-2497/\">Mockingbird</a> formed a splinter group of Avengers when it was discovered that Mockingbird allowed the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phantom-rider/29-7239/\">Phantom Rider</a> to be killed. When the team sought help from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellstorm/29-14695/\">Hellstorm</a> for the Phantom Rider's haunting of Mockingbird, it was discovered that Khonshu was inside Moon Knight's mind. Hellstorm was able to convince the god to leave Moon Knight's mind. Things didn't go so well after his encounter with Hellstrom, when Marc launched a premeditated attack against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-doom/29-1468/\">Doctor Doom</a>. The Avengers were sorely disappointed and rightly scolded him for his actions. Eventually Marc found out that it was Khonshu, not him, who wanted to join the Avengers West Coast. With that in mind, Moon Knight resigned from the active roster and burned his Avenger Identicard.</p><h3>Infinity War and Crusade</h3><p>When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magus/29-14619/\">Magus</a>, the evil incarnation of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adam-warlock/29-6805/\">Adam Warlock</a> plan to gain absolute power, he created evil doppelgangers of both heroes and villains on earth. Moon Knight had to face his own evil self, manifested as Moonshade which he defeated. After the War, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goddess/29-9477/\">Goddess</a>, the good incarnation of Adam Warlock recruited many heroes who are very spiritual, religious have had near-death experiences. Because of Moon Knight's close affiliation with the moon god and his first resurrection to serve as the avatar of vengeance, the Goddess recruited Moon Knight to defend her as she purges the evil in the universe. Moon Knight was returned to normal when the Goddess was defeated by the combined efforts of Adam Warlock, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thanos/29-7607/\">Thanos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor X</a>.</p><h3>Resurrection War</h3><p>After Moon Knight unfortunately died again, Khonshu seemingly willed him back to life in order to thwart the plans of his three greatest villains: Black Spectre, Raoul Bushman and Morpheus, who were all under the worship of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/seth/29-12718/\">Set</a>, God of Darkness and Chaos. Marc, questioning if his death was real or not, started experiencing dreams of the future in which Marc concludes that it is either Morpheus or Khonshu speaking to him once again. With the knowledge that he is the \"white-light\" of Khonshu, he sets out to thwart their plans, receiving help from <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stained-glass-scarlet/29-14477/\">Stained Glass Scarlet</a> as well. The two are able to defeat the trio and stop their plans of attacking a U.N. building that was holding a meeting at the time. Afterwords, Moon Knight went back to his crime-fighting once again.</p><h3>Lunar Legionnaire's Return</h3><p>In a final battle with Bushman, Marc did something that was indescribably disturbing. He used one of his crescent darts to carve off Bushman's face, giving him a true death's head. Both of his legs were also broken in this confrontation. Unable to continue his career as Moon Knight, Marc began taking more and more painkillers and anti-psychotics. His manner had gotten to the point that he completely and irrevocably alienated those around him, especially Frenchie, who came to the conclusion that there was simply no course of action that he could take that could attempt to assist Marc in even the slightest way. After a heated argument with Marlene, Marc struck her with a great deal of strength. Appalled by this, Marlene left.</p><p>Knowing that he was both physically and psychologically weak, the Committee hired the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/taskmaster/29-4578/\">Taskmaster</a> to take out Moon Knight. Taskmaster tortured Marc but he was defended by his butler and one of his friends. This gave Marc the strength to defeat Taskmaster. Marc then began to rebuild himself and his life. He finally got himself out of his wheelchair and began physical therapy with the help of Frenchie's boyfriend. Frenchie stated that he will no longer will fly for Marc, but one of Gina's sons takes on the role of pilot. (Gina was one of Marc's contacts at the diner Jake would go to). Being a true agent for vengeance, Moon Knight takes back to the streets and attempts to be make up for lost time. His sanity is even more in question as he constantly \"sees\" and \"hears\" Khonshu talk to him and give him foul suggestions. During this dark chapter in Marc's life, Khonshu decided to use the guise of the deceased Bushman to torment Moon Knight.</p><h3>Civil War and the Initiative</h3><p>The Committee hired the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-profile/29-45550/\">The Profile</a> to fully utilize his unusual talents to take down Moon Knight. However, it was soon discovered that he was no match for Marc, and, ironically, became an informant for him instead. Moon Knight later investigated a string of murders which were perpetrated by his former sidekick, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/midnight/29-35695/\">Midnight</a>. Realizing that he had no choice, he was forced to kill Midnight. During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/civil-war/39-40615/\">Civil War</a>, Moon Knight chose neither side because, as he had said to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, \"The war is just like a game of capture the flag\". Captain America reiterated that he wanted Moon Knight not to join the fight because of his \"methods\" of bringing justice and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, seeing his history of psychotic tendencies, decided that arresting him will just make his condition even worse. When the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human Registration Act</a> became a law, Moon Knight felt that he didn't want the law to disrupt his work, so Marc made an attempt to legally register. But Tony outright refused Marc's attempt at registration because of his increasing psychological instability. So he assigned Marc psychiatrist to purposely flunk his psychological exam. The psychiatrist talked to Marc's other personalities but he begins to turn them all down, even threatening Marc for future imprisonment. Marc then demoralized the psychiatrist and was seemingly possessed by his God, Khonshu. Marc scolds the psychiatrist for his antisocial tendencies, as told by The Profile to him earlier. After this the psychiatrist approved Marc registration, but also did something quite peculiar- he bowed down before him and started worshiping him. After he left, Marc went to see The Profile and they discussed the psychiatrist's encounters with Marc's different personalities. At the end of this discussion, Marc stated it was just a rouse to get his registration approved.</p><p>Now that he is a legally registered hero, Moon Knight could continue to stalk the nights and bring justice to the thugs and gangs running around the city. Though not known to Marc, the Black Spectre was recently released from jail and sought revenge against Marc. Knowing that Iron Man is on his heels, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-spectre/29-36456/\">Carson Knowles</a> decided to turn to his life of crime again and frame Moon Knight for murder by killing his victims and carving a crescent moon on the victims head, which was Moon Knight's calling card at the time. Once Moon Knight was caught by SHIELD, Iron Man revoked his ID and told him he is no longer apart of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-initiative/65-42781/\">the Initiative</a>. Looking to still bring justice on Knowles, Marc finds out that he is going to release a stream of nanobots into a big parade in a plan to control the city. Moon Knight thwarts his plan and ends up throwing him off the roof of a building, seemingly killing Knowles. Outed by the government and with SHIELD searching for him, Spector moves underground.</p><p>With a warrant out for his arrest the, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/commission-on-superhuman-activities/65-42060/\">C.S.A</a>. call in for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a> to come and hunt down Moon Knight as a fugitive of the law. Iron Man strongly opposes the idea but is overruled on the matter. Moon Knight continues to lay low only to resurface in a black uniform and a with a few new bones to pick. SHIELD interrogates several of Marc's friends and contacts, although nothing comes out of them. Now is the time for the Thunderbolts to strike. Several weeks later after having a run-in with the Thunderbolts, Moon Knight pleads with Khonshu for forgiveness for losing his faith at him, but the Lunar god will not have it and says that he has worshipers that actually follow him. Marc returned into his costume to help Frenchie, who was attacked by a gang and left his boyfriend injured. But little did he knew that the attack was used to set-up Moon Knight to be captured by the Thunderbolts. Moon Knight was then ambushed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a>. He was captured by the reformed villain team, but he got away when SHIELD came. Frenchie agreed to help Moon Knight while the Thunderbolts release <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bullseye/29-4647/\">Bullseye</a> to kill him. Moon Knight and Bullseye fight all throughout New York and the battle leads them to a warehouse, which was secretly planted with many explosives. Moon Knight sets it off and the warehouse explodes with Bullseye almost getting killed and Moon Knight escaping in a secret passage. Later, in a press conference <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/norman-osborn/29-58812/\">Norman Osborn</a> tells reporters about the Thunderbolts' success in eliminating Moon Knight, while Iron Man condemns his team on the death of the vigilante. Moon Knight is later seen alive having faked his own death, and effectively killing the \"Marc Spector\" persona ,the Jake Lockley persona is in control. Moon Knight is hired by a millionaire to search for his daughter who has been kidnapped by corrupt cops. Little does Moon Knight know that the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> is also in the trail of the corrupt cops and is now out to bring them justice through a method he knows best, punishment.</p><p>Moon Knight then goes to fight off the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-zapata-brothers/65-57516/\">Zapata Brothers</a> (who were brought in by Alcantara after Jake killed his henchmen and took his condemned daughter) only to make a deal with them to take down Alcantara. Moon Knight then proceeds to launch a full-scale assault on Alcantara when he finds everyone is murdered except Alcantara himself until <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/toltec/29-72048/\">Toltec</a> finds them and Moon Knight walks away as Toltec kills Alcantara. Moon Knight (having taken Alcantara's money and bought himself a condo) has seen on TV what Norman Osborn has become and vows to go back to the U.S. and bring him down.</p><h3>Return with a Vengeance</h3><p>Moon Knight has returned to New York to exact his revenge on Norman Osborn and did so by stopping a bank heist in progress without killing a single bank robber, much to the surprise of the police. Khonshu is still convincing him to become the ruthless vigilante he was before, but Moon Knight continues to ignore the temptations of the deity and plans to redeem himself as well as reform into a new hero. News of Moon Knight's return circulated throughout the bustling city, with Norman Osborn denouncing him as a renegade and a menace while promising the public that Moon Knight will be dealt with for his acts of vigilance accordingly. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a> appeared before Moon Knight and reminded him that he can never run from his past and that he will be tested for to prove himself as a hero, to which he replied that he will also be tested as well. Moon Knight paid a visit to his criminal contact, the Profile and told him about the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/slug/29-3230/\">Slug</a> and some stolen diamonds that he has. Moon Knight confronted the Slug and his henchmen for the diamonds, while Khonshu urges him to kill the villain but he was squashed in the floor. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn has delegated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hood/29-41917/\">the Hood</a> on stopping Moon Knight. The Hood then had the Profile to track down and profile Moon Knight. The Profile thought of a plan to take down Moon Knight and it involves the grave of his late nemesis, Raoul Bushman. Jake goes home and sees the news coverage about the jailbreak in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ravencroft-sanitarium/34-56488/\">Ravencroft</a>. Jake suits up as Moon Knight and tells his butler to call his pilot for the Mooncopter, but he cannot reach him and Moon Knight decides to use his other vehicle, <a href=\"/moon-knights-angelwing/18-56914/\">Angelwing</a>. When the hanger doors were opening, Moon Knight was surprised to see his old partner, Frenchie, dressed in a aviator suit and walking on a cane. Reunited with his friend, Frenchie flies the Mooncopter and drops Moon Knight inside the melee of the escaped convicts. In the middle of the chaos, Khonshu is still persuading Moon Knight to kill for him, but to no avail. When Moon Knight called Frenchie to come back, he told him he can't because of an enormous flock of birds blanketing the sky, which was summoned by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarecrow/29-3239/\">Scarecrow</a>. Frenchie then shoots a large net from the Mooncopter to catch the flock, neutralizing it. Moon Knight then catches Scarecrow, but he then argues to him that Moon Knight should confront his old nemesis, Bushman. Moon Knight goes to his contact, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/crawley/29-34561/\">Crawley</a>, for any word from the street,but they were suddenly attacked by Bushman. After taunting him, Bushman fires a RPG to Moon Knight but it hits a corner of building, threatening it to collapse. Moon Knight rushed in to hold the building and Bushman left him to be beaten by his army of convicts from Ravencroft. After beating the convicts with only his underwear and mask on, Moon Knight carves his symbol on all that he defeated on their strait jacket. Spider-Man then swings by and he tried to convince Moon Knight to stop his heroics before he return back to his murderous ways, to which Moon Knight argued that his heroism doesn't fare better because Norman Osborn is still in power. Moon Knight got a tip from Crawley goes in search for Bushman in one of OsCorp's warehouses. Moon Knight then infiltrates the warehouse and begins searching for Bushman to no avail, until he surprises Marc. After a much drawn out, grueling fight between Marc has Raoul pinned down and mounts him with his crescent dart in his hand as if to cut off Bushman's face again. Though Bushman begs Marc not to take his face again, causing much hesitation for the hero before stopping his act. Marc left and let the authorities take care of him. Meanwhile, now that Marc has prevailed, The Profile left to the cavern of Khonshu, for reasons unknown.</p><p>Moon Knight finds that someone has forcibly enter a hospital. When he got there, he saw <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a> about to kill a bed-ridden patient. Moon Knight stops him and they go into a brief scuffle until Deadpool gets thrown through a window and escapes. Moon Knight then finds out that the person he just rescued was a Ukrainian crime boss dying from cancer, that made him question himself about being a hero. Deadpool then met up with his employer, a mother whose son was kidnapped by the crime boss' henchmen. Moon Knight goes to see Deadpool and after they talked, Moon Knight goes to a warehouse to rescue the employer's son. Moon Knight saves the boy and left the henchmen for the police, but soon Deadpool picked up where they left off in their previous encounter. They fought in a carnival's hall of mirrors where the duel turned into a sword fight, which left Moon Knight left as the winner. When Jake was having nightmares in his sleep, he suddenly woke up rushed to get into the hospital but he was too late to save the crime boss from Deadpool's employer who killed him with an injection of potassium chloride, stopping the patient's heart.</p><h3>Heroic Age</h3><p>After the events of Dark Reign and Siege, Norman Osborn was deposed as America's \"top cop\" and his organization H.A.M.M.E.R. was disbanded. Captain Steve Rogers then forms the Secret Avengers as a group of superheroes to operate under a veil of secrecy, in addition to the main Avengers team.Moon Knight was approached by Steve Rogers and he asked him to join the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a> to find his redemption. Moon Knight agrees to this and his first mission was to go after Captain Barracuda who was capturing Oil Tankers. Moon Knight proved himself to the team by saving them and the Tanker crew when Captain Barracuda used the Horn of Proteus to summon sea monsters and destroying the Oil Tanker. Next, Moon Knight infiltrated <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/roxxon/65-56010/\">Roxxon</a> headquarters with fellow Avenger, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/eric-ogrady/29-6774/\">Ant-Man</a>. They then had to travel to Mars to rescue another teammate, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova/29-2105/\">Nova</a> who was looking for the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/serpent-crown/18-15780/\">Serpent Crown</a>. The team split up and Moon Knight was accompanied by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valkyrie/29-6809/\">Valkyrie</a> to look for Nova. When they found him he is wearing the Serpent Crown and he also detected their presence. He and Black Widow were knocked unconscious when they confronted Nova. After the threat on Mars, the team went back to Earth and continues their objective of finding out who is trying to steal the Serpent Crown and why they want it.</p><h3>Shadowland</h3><p>Moon Knight goes to his mansion and sleeps with Marlene, he wakes up and is taunted by Khonshu on going back to his murderous ways and to kill in his name. The other night, Marlene asks Jake out and reveals that she is pregnant, which he is happy about. After days of being taunted by someone calling himself <a href=\"/randall-spector/29-27828/\">Shadow Knight</a>, Jake gets a mission from Steve Rogers to infiltrate <a href=\"/shadowland/34-57004/\">Shadowland</a> as a prisoner. As the heroes and <a href=\"/the-hand/65-1800/\">the Hand</a> ninjas fight each other, Jake takes a white cowl and joins to the melee. <a href=\"/daredevil/29-24694/\">Daredevil</a> then attacks Marc from behind, but when Moon Knight begins to fight him, his mind is subsequently infiltrated by an unknown entity that has been inside Daredevil. Khonshu then appears and tells Moon Knight that in order to kill the creature, he will need the Sapphire Crescent, an artifact that was a part of the original sculpture of Khonshu. Moon Knight asks for it, but Khonshu demands him to kill in his name, which Moon Knight declines to do. When he returns home to his mansion, he finds Marlene in a bloody pulp and is informed that Shadow Knight did this and that the baby she was carrying is now dead. Moon Knight then agrees to kill for Khonshu and he will start with Shadow Knight. When he begins to fight him, he reveals himself to be Randall Spector. The brothers fight it out but Randall escapes. Driven by revenge over what Randall had done to Marlene, Jake agrees to kill Randall in Khonshu's name. The deity then tells him that the Sapphire Crescent is found in New Orleans. Jake finds it in the possession of a fortune teller which he buys for a large sum. As Jake goes back to New York, Randall steals it and the brothers again begin a scuffle in the middle of a Mardi Gras festival. Shadow Knight begins to tell Moon Knight that he is doing this because he was sent by the acolyte of Khonshu, the Profile. Jake persuades him that he is being played for a fool by the Profile but he will not have it all. When collateral damage begins to mount, Moon Knight takes control of the fight and corners Shadow Knight on a dock, but he is prepared to commit suicide and kill them all. Moon Knight then throws the Sapphire Crescent into Shadow Knight, slicing his throat and causing him to fall in the water below. Moon Knight then flies off back to Shadowland to face Daredevil and the Hand. Jake declares he is dead and that he is now Marc Spector once again.</p><h3>Move to the West Coast</h3><p>Marc Spector is now a major movie actor and producer in L.A., and has a new batch of personalities in the form of other heroes, such as Spider-Man, Captain America, and <a href=\"/wolverine/29-1440/\">Wolverine</a>. He also has an assistant named Buck Lime who provides technological support. Marc honestly believes that he has been asked specifically by these three heroes to once again take up the mantle of Moon Knight, despite the undeniable fact that they are hallucinations. Marc then investigates a buy-off in the docks and discovers that the gangs are using high-end technology in the possession of <a href=\"/mr-hyde/29-3233/\">Mr. Hyde</a>. Moon Knight decides to engage Hyde in hand-to-hand combat, but Hyde escapes, leaving behind a shipment of <a href=\"/ultron/29-2242/\">Ultron</a> technology. Marc later continues on to uncover more details about this new gang by subconsciously dressing as Spider-Man while attacking the new gang lead by <a href=\"/snapdragon/29-44971/\">Snapdragon</a>. Moon Knight was overwhelmed by the Snapdragon's henchmen and was knocked out. He woke up and discovered that he was rescued by <a href=\"/echo/29-9038/\">Echo</a>, who was undercover at the time and had to blow her cover in order to save Moon Knight. Moon Knight sets up a meeting with Echo to discuss her knowledge on the gang she infiltrated, but they were disrupted by the Night Shift. After defeating them, the two heroes were captured and put under arrest by the police, but later make a daring escape. After their clever, daring escape, Marc and Maya decide it would be best to separate while the cops were actively looking for them. But just before they part ways, Marc softly kisses Maya, and she responds by nearly beating him to a pulp.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Moon Knight has been highly trained in hand-to-hand combat throughout his careers as a boxer, marine, and <a href=\"/cia/65-55745/\">CIA</a> agent. He is not the conventional hero, as he will use drastic means and violence to stop criminals.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"101120\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2195/101120-128636-moon-knight_super.jpg\" title=\"Fist of Khonshu\"><img id=\"101120\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2195/101120-128636-moon-knight_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Fist of Khonshu\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Fist of Khonshu</div></div></div></div><p>Due to his multiple personalities, Moon Knight has developed some protection against psychic assaults. When he became the <a href=\"/moon-knight-fist-of-khonshu/49-3492/\">Fist of Khonshu</a>, he adopted powers derived from the moon itself. Moon Knight had enhanced strength, stamina, and reflexes based on the phase of the moon. He is at his strongest during a full moon, as he could lift the weight of 2 tons and at normal strength when there is a no moon, where he could lift around 700 lbs. He can also see magical beings that normal humans cannot see and possesses night vision as well. Moon Knight can also become invisible in a shadowed area.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>His mode of transportation is the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moon-knights-helicopter/18-51739/\">Mooncopter</a> that is mainly piloted by Frenchie but has had different pilot's operate for him and Angelwing that is a smaller version of the Mooncopter but he can pilot it or by remote control. He is also an expert at throwing weapons especially his trademark crescent darts that he also uses to carve his crescent moon signature on his defeated foes and at one point to carve his nemesis' face off. While he was the Fist of Khonshu, he was given ancient Egyptian weapons by the followers of Khonshu, but later retires these items to be replaced to more updated weapons.</p><p>And he has also some kind of \"healing factor\", his wounds are quickly healed when shined in moonlight. This no longer seems to be the case as he had rejected Khonshu from his body and Hellstorm's exorcism of the moon god. After suffering a crippling incident, he has had to rebuild his body back to form.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1498857\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71627/1498857-moon_knight_03_super.jpg\" title=\"MK Suited Up\"><img id=\"1498857\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/71627/1498857-moon_knight_03_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MK Suited Up\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">MK Suited Up</div></div></div></div><p>Recently, Moon Knight rides a moon-themed motorcycle and has been wearing <a href=\"/moon-knights-carbonadium-armor/18-56913/\">body armor</a> made out of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/carbonadium/12-42386/\">carbonadium</a> that protects him from large caliber bullets and gives him superhuman strength that can hold a section of a building from collapsing. The <a href=\"/moon-knights-carbonadium-armor/18-56913/\">armor</a> can also be remotely reassemble back to Moon Knight's body. Moon Knight also has a black variant of his armor used in stealth missions and another costume without the cape that he had used on a mission to Mars. He also carries <a href=\"/moon-knights-tripwire-guns/18-56915/\">TripWire guns</a> that fire crescent darts that are connected with a cable to pin down criminals or use as a grappling hook and he can now fire multiple crescent darts from under his wrist and it can also fire a parachute to slow down his decent. Moon Knight now has a katana with a moon-theme hilt guard and bow. His costume can also deploy a miniature <a href=\"/angelwing/18-56587/\">Angelwing</a> aircraft that has a camera mounted on it to serve as a surveillance to scout a dangerous area. He also has mechanical bracelets that replicate Spider-Man's webshooters with built-in claws used to mimic those of Wolverine's.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3><b>Marvel 2099 (Earth-928)</b></h3><p>A female Moon Knight is featured fighting crime in the lunar city of <a href=\"../../attilan/34-44155/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Attilan</a>.

He later worked in Roxxon Industries under the name of Paladin until Roxxon fell apart, and later adopted the guise of Moon Knight. Moon Knight first fought Spider-Man as he thought that he caused a building to explode, and he later got involved in a gang war between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kingpin/29-1483/\">Kingpin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hammerhead/29-6817/\">Hammerhead</a>. In the middle of the fight with Spider-Man, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shang-chi/29-12716/\">Shang-Chi</a>, he was impaled by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/elektra/29-1802/\">Elektra</a>, but not before impaling a moon blade in her head when she was about to kill <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-cat/29-1479/\">Black Cat</a>. Once he had awoken from the coma, courtesy of Elektra, he fought Spider-Man, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> and Daredevil. He was later invited to join Daredevil's new group, known as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ultimate-knights/65-43062/\">Ultimate Knights</a>, whose primary goal was to bring down the Kingpin of crime. He created a new personality, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ronin/29-41928/\">Ronin</a>, in order to infiltrate Kingpin's organization and get closer to him. Among all the Ultimate Knights, Moon Knight was the first to volunteer to pose as Kingpin's bodyguard/assassin.</p><p>When the Kingpin decides to test Moon Knight's allegiance, he orders him to capture Spider-Man. He discovers that a majority of the criminals in Kingpin's organization believe that Spider-Man goes to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/midtown-high-school/34-55690/\">Midtown High School</a>. So, in order to lure Spider-Man out of his daily routine, he drives a bus through the school's wall. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kitty-pryde/29-3548/\">Kitty Pryde</a> arrives before Spider-Man, and ends up being knocked-out by Ronin's vicious attack with a fire extinguisher. Spider-Man arrives just in time to see it happen, then jumps into the fight himself. He ends up being shot with a tranquilizer dart in the neck, and then Ronin uses his web shooters to swing away from the school, bringing him to the Kingpin. When he arrives, he only says, \"What's next?\u201d</p><p>While Spider-Man was being tortured by Kingpin, Ronin stood in the back; however, it turns out Fisk knew he was Moon Knight all along. He attacked him and had his men take him to the river and executed in costume to send a message to the other \"costumes\". In Moon Knight's mind we see Moon Knight drowning and the other three personalities standing around him. Suddenly, Ronin comes in and pulls him out of the water. From there he went to the police and told them who he was and that Wilson Fisk sent him to be executed being the first hero ever to publicly unmask himself to enforce justice. Wilson Fisk was arrested and prosecuted thanks to Moon Knight, at the cost of his secret identity being revealed.</p><p>It is stated that he suffers from an incredibly complex case of dissociative identity disorder (commonly known as multiple personality disorder). It is so complex that the identities: Marc Spector, Steven Grant, Moon Knight, and a little red-haired girl actually speak to each other on what appears to be a playground. This condition may have been worsened by the creation of his Ronin personality, a ruthless and driven alter-ego willing to open fire on students at midtown high with a sub-machinegun in order to draw out Spiderman (the official marvel universe guide also states that the Ronin personality enjoyed increased strength and agility due to Dr. Strange's mystical enhancements). Moonknight is currently living with his girlfriend, Marlene, who complains frequently about Moon Knight's disorder.</p><h3><b>House of M (Earth-58163)</b></h3><p>In the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/house-of-m/39-40991/\">House of M</a> reality, he was a CIA operative before <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>'s reign of mutant supremacy.

They are sometimes referred to as the \"Daughters of the Dragon\" because of Colleen's background.&nbsp;<br /><h2>Creation&nbsp;</h2>Colleen Wing was created by <a href=\"/doug-moench/26-42016/\">    Doug Moench</a> and <a href=\"/larry-hama/26-12272/\">    Larry Hama</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/marvel-premiere/49-2575/\">    Marvel Premiere</a> #19 in November 1974.<br />\n<h2>Major Story Arcs <br /></h2>Her new role as a hero for hire would put her into conflict against her old friend Iron Fist when both Colleen and Misty were enslaved by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/angar-the-screamer/29-32260/\">    Angar the Screamer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/master-khan/29-12603/\">    Master Khan</a>, forcing them to fight against their will although they would later recover. After a similar altercation in which Colleen was captured by another foe she developed a heroin addiction. Misty Knight was able to help her friend once more, as the two had done for each other many times before, and Wing not only kicked the habit but got revenge on her captor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Colleen during this time had an on-again-off-again relationship with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bob-diamond/29-10318/\">    Bob Diamond</a>.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The heroes for hire, who went by the name Knightwing Restorations Ltd, would go on to aid many other heroes during their careers together - including the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">    X-Men</a> - during adventures that took them from Japan to Canada and back. <br />&nbsp;<br />Colleen, along with Misty Knight and Luke Cage continued to operate the Heroes for Hire even after the chaos caused by Onslaught, before the lost heroes of Marvel returned. <br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3>Heroes for Hire - Civil War <br /></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"181095\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181095-150625-heroes-for-hire_super.jpg\" title=\"Heroes for Hire \"><img id=\"181095\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/181095-150625-heroes-for-hire_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Heroes for Hire \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Heroes for Hire </div></div></div></div>\nAfter that relationship, Colleen once again started up the Daughters of the Dragon organization with Misty to make a name for themselves. Succeeding in that, she became part of the new <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/heroes-for-hire/65-23588/\"> <u>Heroes for Hire</u></a>, authorized by Tony Stark after the Superhero Registration act, again alongside Misty. Colleen was identified as one of the 142 registered superheroes who registered as part of the Initiative. In her group's most recent mission, Colleen Wing and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tarantula/29-1528/\"> <u>Tarantula</u></a> were offered to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/brood-queen/29-14746/\">    Brood Queen</a> by their possessed teammate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/humbug/29-30619/\"> <u>Humbug</u></a>. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shang-chi/29-12716/\">    Shang-Chi</a> and the other heroes come save them, Colleen is in traumatic shock; she is further agitated when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moon-boy/29-7224/\"> <u>Moon-Boy</u></a>, whom the group had been hired to apprehend for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/65-3775/\"> <u>S.H.I.E.L.D.</u></a> is taken into custody by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paladin/29-10584/\"> <u>Paladin</u></a>. Misty had made a deal with him in order to find both her and Tarantula after their capture. Colleen, deeply upset by this, left the group as a result. Heroes For Hire itself apparently disbanded permanently in the aftermath of this event.<br />When Iron Fist appeared on television acting out of character, Colleen confronted him, only to find out that he was in fact a <a>    Skrull</a> impostor.<br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3>Shadowland <br /></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1225336\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5344/1225336-colleen_super.jpg\" title=\"Shadowland: Daughters of the Shadow \"><img id=\"1225336\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/5344/1225336-colleen_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Shadowland: Daughters of the Shadow \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shadowland: Daughters of the Shadow </div></div></div></div>\nWhen Daredevil took charge of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-hand/65-1800/\">    the Hand</a> and seized control of Hell's Kitchen, \nColleen and several other heroes pleaded him to stop without violence, but their plans are spoiled.

To help support his family, Guthrie decided to work in his father's occupational field as a coal miner. The dangerous nature of the occupation caught up with him one day when Sam found himself trapped in a collapsing mine shaft. While trying to rescue his fellow worker, a friend of his father's who had introduced him to the job, Sam subconsciously activated his mutant ability to propel himself at superhuman speeds and used it to bring the pair to safety.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Cannonball was created by writer <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a> and artist <a href=\"/bob-mcleod/26-4322/\">Bob McLeod</a> and introduced in Marvel Graphic Novel #4.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>The New Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1103815\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1103815-710819_new_mutants_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The New Mutants\"><img id=\"1103815\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/1103815-710819_new_mutants_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The New Mutants\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The New Mutants</div></div></div></div><p>The coal incident brought Samuel to the attention <a href=\"/donald-pierce/29-3556/\">Donald Pierce</a>, who hired him as a mercenary for the Hellfire Club. Pierce intended to use him in a plot to attack the X-Men's junior team, the New Mutants. Sam's kind nature brought him to his senses and he eventually turned against Pierce. <a href=\"/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Charles Xavier</a> saw the good qualities inside Sam, citing Pierce's manipulation as the cause for his misdeeds, and asked him to join his New Mutants. Cannonball left his large farming family in Kentucky to join the team.</p><p>As part of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>, Sam formed close friendships with his fellow teammates <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">Sunspot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Wolfsbane</a>. Although initially a slow learner at using his mutant abilities, eventually Sam had an ongoing rivalry with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Danielle Moonstar</a> (then known as Psyche) as the two acted as the team co-leaders. He also supervised other teammates, including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/illyana-rasputin/29-8303/\">Magik</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Cypher</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>, among others. Early on in his career with the team, Cannonball visited <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nova-roma/34-54217/\">Nova Roma</a> and encountered his future teammate Magma. With the team, he soon met the New Mutant rivals, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a>, a team structured as the future of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> (the Hellions were also the anti-thesis of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>, with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jetstream/29-2143/\">Jetstream</a> his supposed equivalent ).</p><p>With the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a>, Cannonball also encountered the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gladiator/29-4653/\">Gladiator</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shadow-king/29-14889/\">Shadow King</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/loki/29-4324/\">Loki</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/enchantress/29-7225/\">Enchantress</a>, and other major villains. Sam also met a young intergalactic rock star named <a>Lila Cheney</a>, with whom he eventually shared a romance. Guthrie also teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a> and defeated the nefarious <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/incandescent-man/29-31493/\">Incandescent Man</a>.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-mutants/65-15971/\">New Mutants</a> eventually found themselves under the guidance of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a> at the behest of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/professor-x/29-1505/\">Professor Xavier</a>. Magneto's heavy handed leadership did not sit well with the team, and Cannonball began to display a measure of independence and rebellion against authority. These traits would grow stronger as he matured. In an encounter with the ancient entity, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beyonder/29-10300/\">Beyonder</a>, he killed them out of curiosity. They were resurrected by the Beyonder soon after, but this trauma left the team deeply shaken, and for a time they went with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, to her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/massachusetts-academy/34-47788/\">Massachusetts Academy</a> to join the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hellions/65-3199/\">Hellions</a>.</p><p>They eventually recover from the trauma, after a fight with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, in which they are forced to rescue <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warlock/29-7223/\">Warlock</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magneto/29-1441/\">Magneto</a>. Over time with the New Mutants, Sam develops a brotherly affection for <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wolfsbane/29-4557/\">Rahne</a> although he remained oblivious for some time that Rahne harbored much deeper feelings for him. They worked with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/power-pack/65-40498/\">Power Pack</a> when the latter group needed help dealing with a team of minor demons. Sam leads the group in chasing the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/impossible-man/29-7590/\">Impossible Man</a> around the world, who had gotten into a potentially deadly one-upmanship competition with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/warlock/29-7223/\">Warlock</a>.</p><p>Sam even meets (and fights) his older self when an alternate future version of the team travels to his time. This adventure was erased out of his mind by the future version of his friend <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>. Sam meets with Lila again. A jealous admirer of Lila drugs Sam, intending to kill him. The resulting fight leads to the accidental release of the creature <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bird-brain/29-30056/\">Bird-Brain</a> who would join the team for a while. Unfortunately for the team, taking Bird-Brain back to his island home ends with the shooting death of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cypher/29-14559/\">Douglas Ramsey</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ani-mator/29-30075/\">Ani-Mator</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bird-brain/29-30056/\">Bird Brain</a>'s creator. The team also battles Cameron Hodge and the Right. Defying Magneto, the team sneaks out to another <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lila-cheney/29-4556/\">Lila Cheney</a> concert. They are swept up in a kidnapping of Lila and dealings with the powerful entity known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gosamyr/29-29330/\">Gosamyr</a>. In preventing Gosamyr's relatives from endangering innocent lives, Lila seemingly dies.</p><p>Returning to Earth, the team got caught in the events of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/inferno/39-41408/\">Inferno</a>. They team up with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-terminators/65-40418/\">X-Terminators</a> who would eventually merge into their team.

Later, any rivalries were put aside, as Sam was instrumental in helping the other X-Men, particularly <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a> and Wolfsbane, defeat the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/phalanx/29-9651/\">Phalanx</a>.</p><h3>X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1209233\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1209233-43163_xforce_v1_090_04_rougher_122_108lo_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1209233\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11352/1209233-43163_xforce_v1_090_04_rougher_122_108lo_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>In the mid 1990s, X-Force reestablished ties with the X-Men. Sam later officially accepts an invitation to join the X-Men. Initially, Sam is excited, this having been his dream since first arriving at Xavier's school. During this time, he was also a supporting character in Wolverine's own comic. During this time, Sam becomes unsure of himself and his abilities. He privately expresses doubts about his abilities to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, causing the veteran X-Man much discomfort. Sam battles the head of the Shi'ar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-guard/65-6097/\">Imperial Guard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/gladiator/29-4653/\">Gladiator</a> to a standstill, despite being overpowered, thus facing his doubts about his abilities, only to be left behind as the rest of the X-Men were taken into space to save the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar-empire/34-23199/\">Shi'ar empire</a>. This led Sam to again question his place on the X-Men. During his time with X-Men, Cannonball found his relationship with Tabitha strained. It was so strained she turned to Sam's best friend, Sunspot, for \"support\". Sam returned to the X-Men, for a brief period until he left the team to help his ailing mother. During his time with the X-Men, he also infiltrated the presidential campaign of anti-mutant candidate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/graydon-creed/29-13351/\">Graydon Creed</a>, using the alias \"Samson Guthry\". Despite the rather transparent alias, Sam was able to remain undetected until Creed was assassinated on the eve of the election.</p><p>Sam was there when the mutant entity <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/onslaught/29-13352/\">Onslaught</a> erupted from Xavier's mind. The entity, before attacking, had enjoyed several minutes of tearing apart Sam psychologically. Cannonball rejoined X-Force, now independent of Cable and operating in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/san-francisco/34-55704/\">San Francisco</a>. Cannonball eventually became team leader again, after the injuries sustained by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/siryn/29-3181/\">Siryn</a>. The team eventually found a new mentor, by the name of Pete Wisdom, who introduced the team to the world of espionage. During this time, Sam and Tabitha had gotten back together. After Wisdom's alleged death, Sam led the team again and attempted to continue Wisdom's crusade. Eventually, Sam and other members of X-Force have to fake their deaths.</p><h3>X-Corporation</h3><p>After X-Force\u2019s dissolution, Cannonball joined several of his former teammates and former members of X-Force and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/generation-x/65-15083/\">Generation X,</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paris/34-56052/\">Paris</a>, France branch, of Professor X's international mutant task force <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-corporation/65-40425/\">X-Corporation</a>. His time with the X-Corporation wasn't a pleasant one. En route to a mission, later found to involve the Weapon Plus program, his teammate <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/darkstar/29-10990/\">Darkstar</a> poked fun at him for eating a sandwich that would have rather distasteful consequences for \"everybody who went out without an umbrella in downtown Beauvais.\" This moment of levity at Cannonball's expense did not last, as on that same mission, Darkstar died. At the funeral of Darkstar, Xavier gave Cannonball a note, with the whereabouts of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lila-cheney/29-4556/\">Lila Cheney</a>. Sam decided to take time away from the X-Corporation, as the strain of his life began to get to him. He worked for a time cleaning up damages to the France-England tunnel, AKA the Chunnel, which was partially destroyed in the very same mission which killed Darkstar.</p><h3>X-Treme X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"75765\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75765-95404-cannonball_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"75765\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/40/75765-95404-cannonball_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>While away, Sam rekindled his romantic relationship with Lila Cheney for a time. Sam couldn't find peace with his life so he was asked by Storm to join her X-Treme X-Men, a group of X-Men operating outside of Professor X's leadership. For a time, he even was partnered with his old friend Wolverine during an adventure where they pursued long time X-Man foe <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/william-stryker/29-40564/\">William Stryker</a>. Sam also found himself having a reunion of sorts with former teammates, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunspot/29-4644/\">Sunspot</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/magma/29-4558/\">Magma</a>. He and his teammates rejoined the central X-Men, after the events of Planet X. Sam is injured on a mission and once again decided to break for some peace. He uses the time to work on his own farm, which he had bought with his X-Corporation paychecks. While on the farm, Sam found himself teaming up again with Cable and reformed X-Force against the threat of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skornn/29-9638/\">Skornn</a>. Sam and former X-Force teammate, Siryn, went in search of Cable with the mercenary <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/deadpool/29-7606/\">Deadpool</a>, who could track the missing man via a unique teleportation bond the two shared. Deadpool derisively refers to Sam as \"Cannonballs\".</p><p>Sam has once more joined the active roster of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, whose team is co-led by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightcrawler/29-1461/\">Nightcrawler</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a>. For a while he literally and figuratively watches over the younger, more carefree students at the X-Mansion. He also functions as a member of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-treme-sanctions-executive/65-41159/\">XSE</a>. He has already participated in helping the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/198/65-40592/\">198</a> and fighting the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shiar-death-commandos/65-55991/\">Shi'ar Death Commandos</a>. He soon suffers the death of his brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Jay</a>, who is killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/william-stryker/29-40564/\">William Stryker</a>. In the first part of <i>The First Foursaken</i> story arc, Cannonball went with the X-Men to Central Park, where they fight the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-foursaken/65-56867/\">Foursaken</a>, who then capture the X-Men and sent them elsewhere. After escaping, Cannonball accompanies the X-Men to Africa to help <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> assist mutant refugees.</p><h3>Rogue's X-Men</h3><p>Cannonball later served on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a>'s team of X-Men. The team was formed as a rapid response unit, sent to sudden and emergent threats. The team's unorthodox lineup, which included ex-villains like <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-mastermind/29-12055/\">Lady Mastermind</a>, brought Samuel closer to fellow veteran X-Men Rogue and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, both of whom he had been teamed with previously. After defeating the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/children-of-the-vault/65-43765/\">Children of the Vault</a>, Rogue announced the departure of her team from the mansion. Sam explained his personal feelings about leaving to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a>, saying that he felt he needed to leave the mansion as his former home had become a grave site for his brother <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/icarus/29-9739/\">Jay</a> and the constant reminder became too much.</p><p>Following the defeat of a villain named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pandemic/29-42336/\">Pandemic</a>, the team then fought the alien mummudrai called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-datacondition-critical/39-54251/\">Hecatomb</a>. Coupled with injuries sustained against <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pandemic/29-42336/\">Pandemic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rogue/29-1446/\">Rogue</a> suffered a huge mental injury from Hetacomb, leading the team to rest in Rogue's childhood home in Mississippi. During this time, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/lady-mastermind/29-12055/\">Lady Mastermind</a> betray the X-Men and join the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">Marauders</a> in an attack and retrieval mission to acquire <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destinys-diaries/18-44250/\">Destiny</a> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/destinys-diaries/18-44250/\">'s Diaries</a>.</p><p>After the surprise blitz, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>, disabled by a neuro-toxin, uploaded everything she picked out of what was at the edges of the Marauders' psi-shielding into Sam's mind and takes limited possession over his body, causing him to unwillingly flee (along with Iceman) from the battle. Aboard the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/blackbird/18-41920/\">Blackbird</a>, the two are engaged in midair by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a>, who cripples the jet. Cannonball manages to escape and battle Shiro, who reveals that he killed Cable. Cannonball shakes it off, explaining that it \"wouldn't matter who told me that, ah'd still be sayin' 'show me the body.'\" Sam and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, telepathically prompted by Emma Frost, attempted to recover the Destiny Diaries which are hidden in a dilapidated brewery. The Marauder's master, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-sinister/29-3179/\">Mister Sinister</a>, used a reverse engineered version of Xavier's Cerebro to track the pair of X-Men to the brewery. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marauders/65-40480/\">The Marauders</a> attacked Sam and Iceman and overtook them. After the battle, Sinister attempted to telepathically erase Sam's mind so that the X-Men would find him as an empty shell. This would serve as a lesson to them and to the Marauders as well. However, Sinister was distracted by Iceman, allowing Sam to activate his power to rocket his way out of the brewery and escape. Iceman was also able to escape, but it was revealed that Sam, who crashed through one of the brewery's walls, was seriously injured. It was discovered that his blast field, which protects him from concussive impact when he uses his power, was not working properly. As a result, Sam received compound fractures of the upper and lower legs, a broken collar bone, and other injuries. Sam lies unconscious in the X-Mansion's infirmary. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/beast/29-1462/\">Dr. Henry McCoy</a> attends to his injuries and evaluates his condition. He notes that Sam's brain scan indicates sluggish and non-continuous activity. However, at the end of the issue, Sam is shown conscious, alert, and speaking clearly to Iceman. He quickly recovers and is capable of taking part in the final fight against the Marauders. It has yet to be seen if he has suffered any lingering mental effects from his ordeal at the hands of Mr. Sinister.</p><h3>Manifest Destiny</h3><p>After <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> disbands the X-Men, Cannonball goes home. His sister <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/husk/29-3426/\">Paige</a> picks him up at the airport, extremely happy to have him back with the family. Sam is moody and withdrawn following the tragic and traumatic events of Messiah Complex and the disbanding of the X-Men. As they drive, he asks Paige to stop at a local bar. As soon as he walks in, the local men begin to glare at him, and the bartender asks him not to start anything. Paige knows that Sam came to the bar for a fight, as it's filled with members of the Cabot family (rival family whose daughter had a <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i>-esque romance with Sam's brother Jay). Soon the Cabots confront Sam, and he pushes them to attack him, which they happily do. Paige refuses to participate, and Sam defeats all four men alone, trying to prove something to himself after he was helpless and hospitalized during the X-Men's last big battle. Paige demands to know what's wrong with him, and he angrily blasts off into the sky, saying he should have never come home.</p><p>Sam is soon called by Cyclops, informing him that the X-Men are reforming and establishing themselves now in San Francisco. Sam agrees to join this new team. He arrives in San Francisco just as Magneto is attacking the city with a group of antique Sentinels. Sam manages to plow into Magneto, disarming his artificial magnetism suit, and allowing the X-Men the upper hand in the battle. Unfortunately, Magneto still manages to escape.</p><h3>Young X-Men</h3><p>After Messiah Complex, the X-Men were disassembled, including the New X-Men. A new comic book, <i>Young X-Men</i> finds the newly formed <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-x-men/65-51146/\">Young X-Men</a> team faced with a new incarnation of the Brotherhood of Mutants. An ominous clue as to the identity of the new Brotherhood of Mutants suggests that the new Brotherhood may not be \"new\" and that they are led by the new Lord Imperial of the Hellfire Club. In the first issue of <i>Young X-Men,</i> the last page reveals Sunspot, Magma, Moonstar, and Cannonball as members. The hint alludes to the fact that the New Brotherhood were also once New Mutants. However this was only a ruse of Donald Pierce who had disguised himself as Cyclops and gathered the Young X-Men for his own ends.</p><h3>Secret Invasion</h3><p>Sam is seen working alongside <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/armor/29-4442/\">Armor</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colossus/29-1460/\">Colossus</a> when the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/skrulls/65-40668/\">Skrulls</a> invade San Francisco.</p><h3>A New Mutant Again</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1191938\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55549/1191938-1270528651.jpg\" title=\"Reunited\"><img id=\"1191938\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55549/1191938-1270528651_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Reunited\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Reunited</div></div></div></div><p>Recently Cannonball brought back the New Mutants to save Karma and later Moonstar, who had both found <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/legion/29-13349/\">Legion</a>.

The team was able to save both of their former teammates and took Legion to Utopia under <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/danger/29-40862/\">Danger</a>'s care. Though <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/moonstar/29-1463/\">Moonstar</a> and Cannonball had a fight about leadership of the team, everything turn out for the better and the team was formed.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"371048\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11768/371048-140193-cannonball.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"371048\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/11768/371048-140193-cannonball_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Cannonball is a <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant/12-40656/\">mutant</a> with abilities that allow him to become like a human rocket. He is able to discharge thermo-kinetic energy from his body, thus thrusting himself forward in high-speed flight. When he flies, a very durable force field surrounds his body and any passengers he may be carrying, making him and/or them virtually invulnerable to harm. Originally, Sam was unable to stop himself once he had begun flying. He would have to have to either find an object strong enough to force him to stop, or keep flying until his powers ran out of energy. But, with practice, Cannonball has learned to stop himself without having to resort to either of those options. It should be noted that, even when flying at top speed, Cannonball still has rather impressive maneuverability. He has also started to learn to project his thermo-kinetic energy into powerful concussive blasts. Sam is also a capable hand to hand combatant, having been trained by Cable.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p><b>Earth-1601: Ultimate</b></p><p>Cannonball is a member of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma Frost</a>'s Academy of Tomorrow.

As the news about Sam became the talk of the town, some difficulties sooner came as he was mistaken to be dating with someone's girlfriend. They confronted Sam and bullied her. For being insulted, Sam taught them a lesson using his powers. The townsfolk believed that Sam was bad.

Her parents had a tight and tense relationship because her father was a strict law student, where as her mother was a free-spirited entertainer. Their relationship ultimately came to an end, when Katherine walked out on Carter while Alison was still a child, leaving Carter to raise her alone. Katherine's departure had a strong effect on Carter, who decided to keep her leaving a secret from Alison for the rest her life.</p><p>As Alison entered adolescence, and developed an ambition of becoming a talented singer, her father became extremely intolerant of the idea. He forced her to choose a life similar to his own and follow an education in law. However, despite her father's actions, Alison became a singer as well as continuing her path to law school. Alison's grandmother, Bella Blaire, was more sympathetic toward Alison and encouraged her to explore her real talents.</p><p>However, while Alison was performing at a high school dance show, her mutant powers manifested, and she was forced to blind all in attendance to save herself from persecution. After this event, Alison hid her mutation for years, afraid of what she was capable of. This only caused further alienation between her and her father. By the time she had reached university, Alison began to explore her mutation and continued excelling in her musical career. She created her own unique performing suit, with mirrored clothes, make-up, and a pair of roller-skates. She also gave herself the nickname, 'Dazzler.' At her graduation ceremony, she informed her father that she was not going to be attending the law school he'd selected. Instead she opted to pursue her career as a singer, with or without Carter's blessing and financial support.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The creation of Dazzler was the result of a cross-promotion between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel/57-31/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marvel</a> and a musical record label called Casablanca Records. Sometime around 1980, Casablanca approached Marvel with the idea of creating a new comic hero, while at the same time in the real world a new artist (working for Casablanca) would take on the same persona as this character. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/john-romita-jr/26-13709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Romita Jr.</a> designed her first costume, but the remainder of Dazzler's character traits came together from the input of many people. Conflicts between the ideas developed by Marvel and the record company arose. Dazzler made her first appearance in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Uncanny X-Men</a> #130 before the development had finished, and the cross promotion eventually collapsed, with Dazzler's solo series beginning in 1981.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1898175\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33603/1898175-x_men131_09b.jpg\" title=\"Dazzler meets the X-Men\"><img id=\"1898175\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33603/1898175-x_men131_09b_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dazzler meets the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dazzler meets the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>In one of her first major appearances, she managed to beat out the <a href=\"/enchantress/29-7225/\">Enchantress</a> during an audition for a local talent agency, despite the fact that the goddess used her magicks to enhance her singing ability. Enraged, the Enchantress attacked Dazzler at her show, where a number of prominent heroes were in attendance. Dazzler ended up defeating the Enchantress herself, and began the roller coaster of being a reluctant superhero.</p><p>In the beginning stages of her singing career, Alison had huge obstacles pop up in front of her: she was detected by both the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a> and the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> as a mutant, and both groups wished to recruit her, the <a href=\"/hellfire-club/65-13357/\">Hellfire Club</a> by force. They appeared at a club where Dazzler was performing and attacked with armored troops. With the X-Men's aid she escaped.</p><p>At her first stadium show, she was forced to battle the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, who had been working (in his alter-ego form, Bruce Banner) as a roadie. After defeating the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, she was noticed by the secret government organization <a href=\"/project-pegasus/34-44379/\">Project Pegasus</a>, who wanted to study her abilities.</p><p>While with the project, Alison's powers were tested exhaustively, and the scientists discovered that there was no limit to the amount of sound that she could transduce into light. Dazzler also had made her own discovery, she'd developed a mutual attraction to <a href=\"/quasar/29-3319/\">Quasar</a>, who was head of security at Project Pegasus. The dalliance was short lived, however, when one of Dazzler's fellow subjects, <a href=\"/klaw/29-3171/\">Klaw</a>, (who was composed of solid sound) attempted to escape. She aided Quasar in the battle, absorbing the would-be escapee completely. As an act of contrition, she succeeded where Klaw had failed and escaped the evil compound once and for all.</p><p>Soon after her escape, she was captured by <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a>. Galactus needed Dazzler's abilities, in that she was the only being that could safely exist in a black hole. His former herald <a href=\"/terrax/29-2106/\">Terrax</a>, betrayed Galactus and fled from his wrath to hide in a black hole. Galactus super-charged Dazzler with sound, and sent her in after Terrax. Dazzler battled Terrax defeating and dragging him back to <a href=\"/galactus/29-2149/\">Galactus</a> for punishment. Since she finished her assignment, she was returned to Earth.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2528494\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2528494-dazz13_vspoundcakes.jpg\" title=\"Trading punches with Poundcakes - Dazzler #13\"><img id=\"2528494\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2528494-dazz13_vspoundcakes_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Trading punches with Poundcakes - Dazzler #13\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Trading punches with Poundcakes - Dazzler #13</div></div></div></div><p>One of the more exciting stories was in Dazzler #13 when Alison fought the Grapplers in Ryker's Island Prison. The women prisoners group consisted of Letha, Poundcakes, Screaming Mini/Songbird and Titania. At first the women have their way with the lovely girl and they cannot believe that she defeated Klaw. They consider her a creampuff. However, Alison eventually uses her mutant powers to defeat all four of the women.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"76993\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76993-32857-dazzler_super.jpg\" title=\"Stardom\"><img id=\"76993\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/76993-32857-dazzler_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Stardom\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Stardom</div></div></div></div><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2528427\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2528427-2227346_1730720_oc_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Seized by Doctor Octopus - Dazzler 17\"><img id=\"2528427\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2528427-2227346_1730720_oc_super_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Seized by Doctor Octopus - Dazzler 17\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Seized by Doctor Octopus - Dazzler 17</div></div></div></div><p>Although Alison had many men vying for her affections, it was at this point that <a href=\"/archangel/29-2112/\">Archangel</a> began courting her in earnest, seeing Alison as a preferable alternative to the string of bimbos he'd dated. Although things never worked out between them, he helped reunite her with her estranged father and mother. He also teamed up with Alison to battle Doctor Octopus.</p><p>Dazzler eventually traveled to the west coast, where she tried her hand at acting. She met and became romantically involved with movie producer <a>Roman Nekoboh</a>, who convinced her to film a movie telling her story. He also convinced her to come out as a mutant to her fans. Alison agreed, but the backlash from her non-mutant fans prevented them from releasing \"Dazzler: The Movie.\"</p><p>Her career was in shambles. The only work she could procure was as a backing musician for interstellar rock star, <a>Lila Cheney</a>. This did not last long, since the <a>Beyonder</a> summoned a number of Earth's heroes (including Dazzler) to battle a number of villains. He also took a special romantic interest in Dazzler, declaring her the most beautiful and powerful being he had ever met. After several failed attempts to win her over, the Beyonder returned her to Earth.</p><h3>X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"186697\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7086/186697-169294-dazzler_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men Costume\"><img id=\"186697\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7086/186697-169294-dazzler_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men Costume\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men Costume</div></div></div></div><p>Dazzler was yet again forced into the life of a super-heroine, having been possessed by the entity known as <a href=\"/malice/29-11877/\">Malice</a> . She summoned the X-Men for help. They managed to defeat Malice and liberate Dazzler, at which point she realized that joining them was her best option. Unfortunately, in doing this she had to come to terms with the former villain <a>Rogue</a>, who had been one of Dazzler's worst enemies. During this period the X-Men left New York and stayed in <a href=\"/australia/34-55838/\">Australia</a>. This move was the result of a battle with the <a href=\"/adversary/29-26995/\">Adversary</a> where the X-Men sacrificed their lives to power one of <a href=\"/forge/29-4279/\">Forge</a>'s spells. <a href=\"/roma/29-14810/\">Roma</a> then resurrected the team and transported them to Australia. <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> led the team and they battled many devious villains including the <a href=\"/reavers/65-9726/\">Reavers</a>, <a href=\"/master-mold/29-10254/\">Master Mold</a>, and <a href=\"/freedom-force/65-24132/\">Freedom Force</a>(among others). They also defended New York against the demon hordes of Limbo during Inferno. While with the X-Men, Dazzler fell hard for fellow teammate, <a>Longshot</a>. Her training and skills grew as she stayed with them. However, when she looked within the magic gem known as the <a>Siege Perilous</a>, she saw all the other possibilities of her life (including a possible life as a bag-lady) shaking her new-found confidence. It became necessary for her to push Rogue through this gem, in order to defeat <a>Master Mold</a>. <a>Psylocke</a> was forced to send the surviving members through as well, to save their lives from the <a>Reavers</a>, who had taken over their town . After defeating Master Mold and fleeing the Reavers, an amnesia-suffering Dazzler washed up on a beach in <a href=\"/california/34-55716/\">Malibu, California</a>. Luckily, she was found by fellow Cat's Laughing crew member, <a>Strong Guy</a>. She agreed to rejoin the band, but not even watching the public debut of her movie could return her memory.</p><p>Eventually, she was found by former lover Longshot, who convinced her to accompany him to his home dimension of Mojoworld. He had to return to the rebellion that he had begun. Slowly, her memories began to return and after their victory on Mojoworld, Alison married <a>Longshot</a> and became pregnant. Sadly, she lost the child due to a miscarriage.</p><p>Dazzler returned to Earth without Longshot and traveled to <a href=\"/england/34-55794/\">England</a>, where her music was featured in a retro resurgence. She began singing in her original stage outfit. After the events of <a href=\"/decimation/39-43626/\">Decimation</a>, the prejudice against mutants worsened, and Dazzler was as unpopular as ever. She fell on hard times resorting to low-level (if any) performances. With a horrible past, no friends, and no foreseen future, she turned to drugs.</p><p>Dazzler was next seen aiding <a>Jean Grey</a> (and the surviving mutants of <a href=\"/genosha/34-40967/\">Genosha</a>) in battle against a re-powered <a>Magneto</a>, who had captured <a>Professor X</a>. Dazzler informed Jean that she believed Longshot had been killed. Jean also, could not help sensing that she had lost the baby. What actually happened has not yet been revealed, although it has been speculated that <a>Shatterstar</a> may actually be Dazzler's (and Longshot's) son as an adult.</p><h3>New Excalibur</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"91018\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1953/91018-124756-dazzler_super.png\" title=\"Excalibur\"><img id=\"91018\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1953/91018-124756-dazzler_medium.png\" alt=\"Excalibur\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Excalibur</div></div></div></div><p>Dazzler resurfaced sometime later, joining <a>Excalibur</a> and giving her singing career another go. During her adventures with the team, Dazzler was \"killed,\" multiple times, only to recover soon after. The first incident occurred after a gig in an English night club where she was killed by an evil Jean Grey. She later miraculously wake up in the hospital, having been given a clean bill of health. Her second death occurred during battle with <a>Black Tom</a>. One of his henchmen shot her in the back, but after a few moments she got up from her death and was essential in his defeat. So far, there has been no explanation as to her bizarre reincarnations. During her stint with New Excalibur; Dazzler, <a>Nocturne</a>, and <a>Juggernaut</a> entered into a rather obscure love triangle. Juggernaut's spurned affections lead to his descension back to villainy. In addition, the team allied itself with the <a>Exiles</a> and Dazzler was reunited Longshot, though he was now suffering from amnesia and did not remember her. Eventually, he regained his feelings for and memories of her and some of his memories during team-up. Together they left their teams to re-establish their relationship, but what transpired between them remains unknown. Dazzler rejoined the X-Men on <a href=\"/utopiaasteroid-m/34-41752/\">Utopia</a> and Longshot joined <a>X-Factor</a> in <a>Detroit</a>.</p><h3>Rejoining the X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"672881\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3347/672881-111_super.jpg\" title=\"On her way to San Fran!\"><img id=\"672881\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3347/672881-111_medium.jpg\" alt=\"On her way to San Fran!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">On her way to San Fran!</div></div></div></div><p>Times again became tough and Dazzler had to put her microphone down. She spent almost all of her left-over money paying for the shows she'd canceled. With the last bit of money she had she bought her plane ticket to <a href=\"../../san-francisco/34-55704/\" rel=\"nofollow\">San Francisco</a>. While on the plane, a man caused a bit of a ruckus going so far as to take a flight attendant hostage. Dazzler tricked the man into singing a duet to distract him. As the song ended, Dazzler blinded him with a light show and blasted him into unconsciousness. Another passenger was so impressed with her performance that he approached her about singing (once a week for a month) at a nightclub he owned. Dazzler accepted and now resides on Utopia with the other powered mutants.</p><p>As she adjusted to life in Cali, her career finally became somewhat steady. Even some of the X-Men attended her concerts. One night, as <a href=\"../../pixie/29-40673/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pixie</a> was leaving Dazzler's venue, she was badly beaten by the <a href=\"../../the-hellfire-cult/65-55783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hellfire Cult</a>. She was rushed to the hospital and <a href=\"../../beast/29-1462/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beast</a> sat by her side, informing her that he had a special guest to see her. Dazzler makes her entrance with little flickers of light dancing around her head. She stays with Pixie to raise her morale. As she left, Dazzler invited Pixie to join her on stage in future shows, due to Pixie's mutant abilities. Pixie politely declined the offer, explaining that she felt as though being an X-Man wasn't exactly for her. Dazzler understood completely, (having felt this way many times before) but informed Pixie that the offer still stood, no matter how long she waited.</p><p>Dazzler received her big break and her fame skyrocketed, but she never forgot about the deal she made with Pixie. Pixie soon took her up on the offer decline and began aiding her in many performances. After a night out on the town, Dazzler, Pixie, and <a href=\"/northstar/29-3190/\">Northstar</a> returned to <a href=\"/graymalkin-industries/34-55967/\">Graymalkin Industries</a>. They discovered <a href=\"/cyclops/29-1459/\">Cyclops</a> sleeping on the couch in the recreation room. In the dark of the room, Northstar asked him if he &amp; <a href=\"/emma-frost/29-1457/\">Emma</a> had had a fight, but Cyclops doesn't answer. Dazzler used her abilities to shed some light on the subject and the trio gets a good peep show, since Cyke is buck naked. He quickly covers up, and as he storms out of the room, he catches a whiff of alcohol on Pixie's breath. She realized what had happened and teleports away. As Cyke reprimanded the two adults, he was suddenly hit with a psychic message from Emma.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"921739\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/921739-718653_dazzler_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Back Home\"><img id=\"921739\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7884/921739-718653_dazzler_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Back Home\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Back Home</div></div></div></div><p>She attempted to alert them to an attack from the <a href=\"../../sisterhood-of-mutants/65-26989/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sisterhood of Mutants</a>, but was subdued by <a href=\"../../lady-mastermind/29-12055/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Mastermind</a>.

The three X-Men took the duo out, and Dazzler was able to join Emma, <a href=\"/karma/29-9849/\">Karma</a>, and <a href=\"/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a> in their efforts to subdue the other Sisterhood members. <a href=\"/psylocke/29-3176/\">Psylocke</a> meanwhile had been returned to her British body, and was under <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a>'s control. Psylocke and Dazzler duked it out, and Psylocke quickly gained the upper hand. Just in time, Dazzler absorbed all of the sound from nearby San Francisco and blasted the beam of light right into Psylocke's face, releasing her from Pryor's telepathic clutches and restoring her to her Asian body.</p><p>Dazzler was also shown as part of the team that took on the <a href=\"/dark-x-men/65-56445/\">Dark X-Men</a>.

Dazzler also discovered that her half-sister, <a href=\"../../mortis/29-43175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lois London</a> (A.K.A. Mortis) was one of Selene's top generals. Lois' fragile mind was being manipulated by Selene who combined her talents with Lois' already existing inferiority complex, resulted in her unbridled hatred toward her half-sister. Dazzler tried to convince her to stop fighting for Selene, but to no avail. When Selene was finally defeated Lois teleported to an unknown destination with <a href=\"../../blink/29-12548/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blink</a>.</p><p>Soon though, Lois contacted Dazzler and set up several meetings to discuss a variety of topics. Dazzler was hesitant, and rightly so, Lois missed all but one of them. The one meeting she did attend resulted in Dazzler being drugged and having quite the rude awakening in <a href=\"../../murderworld/34-41963/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Murderworld</a>. Lois concocted a scheme with <a href=\"../../arcade/29-8429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcade</a> to use his maniacal machinations to end Dazzler's life. While in Arcade's \"fun,\" house, Dazzler fought against artificially synthesized versions of some of her worst former nemeses. (including her one time boss, Galactus) Dazzler was able to defeat every single one, pushing her powers to extents she'd never reached before. Her victory, however complete, did not last long. Klaw appeared (despite being \"killed,\" by Dazzler years ago) and explained how he'd heard Lois' cries of hatred against Dazzler and opted to join forces with Lois in her attempt to destroy her half-sister. Dazzler learned that Klaw reconstituted himself independent of her power, and was now able to resist it. The ensuing battle (though quite exhaustive for Dazzler) resulted in Klaw fleeing for his life. Subsequently she defeats Lois and brings her to Utopia to be treated for the damage Selene had done. Cyclops initially denied Lois residence on the island, but with some harsh words from Dazzler concerning other reformed villains (particularly Emma), he decided to let Lois stay.

She ended up alone and seemed poised to lose the fight, but is saved by Northstar in the nick of time. He and Dazzler meet Gambit, who had unfortunately (and indeed, untimely) reverted to his Death persona. He then attacked Northstar, who was able to evade his cards. As he avoided the attack, it donned on him that he wasn't the intended target, and Dazzler is hit. The blow transformed her into a state similar to Gambit's. Dazzler, (having been completely consumed by the concept of survival of the fittest) joined Gambit's ranks to go after the other X-Men in <a href=\"/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> and infect them as well.Northstar soon found himself under the Death spell and the trio set off to battle Cannonball and Anole and recapture Illyana. As they approached Illyana, they encountered Pixie and <a href=\"../../nastirh/29-42869/\" rel=\"nofollow\">N'Astirh</a>, whose attempt to convince Pixie to kill Illyana had gone unheeded.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1259365\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56503/1259365-daz4_super.jpg\" title=\"Manipulated by Death\"><img id=\"1259365\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56503/1259365-daz4_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Manipulated by Death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Manipulated by Death</div></div></div></div><p>The three infected X-Men began fighting N'Astirh, and Dazzler burned a hole through one of his wings. Realizing N'astirh was less of a threat than the twisted trio, Pixie join forces with him to defeat them. She and N'Astirh are soon at their wits end and loss seemed imminent. Just then, Cannonball arrived with Anole and they took out Northstar without breaking a sweat. Gambit then sent Dazzler after Pixie. As Dazzler approached her, Pixie tried to reach the true Dazzler, reminding her that they'd been friends. Dazzler ignored this and prepared to attack. Luckily, Anole took her out with a strong deck to the face. Pixie was then able to release Illyana and together they stab Gambit with their <a href=\"/soulsword/18-42991/\">Soulswords</a>. The interference this magic created allows Gambit's real personality to defeat the demons controlling him. As Gambit was released from Death's harsh persona, Dazzler and Northstar returned to normal. With Illyana saved and Limbo back under her control the team safely teleported (with Pixie's help) back to Utopia.</p><h3>Curse of the Mutants</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1373812\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56503/1373812-daz2_super.jpg\" title=\"Taking down the Vamps with ease\"><img id=\"1373812\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/56503/1373812-daz2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Taking down the Vamps with ease\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Taking down the Vamps with ease</div></div></div></div><p>Soon, Dazzler found herself part of an away team sent to a vampire populated island to retrieve <a href=\"../../dracula/29-7206/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dracula</a>'s corpse in order to resurrect it. The mission was ultimately a failure, since her UV light producing powers prove ineffective against the vampires. Turns out they were equipped with special light bending medallions. She only makes it out alive with the help of her good friend, Northstar. Emma (who was also part of the team) scolded Dazzler saying she was completely useless in the fight, apart from giving her tan lines. They attacked a second time, again Northstar came to her aid removing the medallions so Dazzler was able to defeat a large group of vampires with relative ease.</p><p>After this, Dazzler investigated a series of vampire murders near the nightclub scene. After visiting a certain club, Alison's search for vampires yielded no results. The only thing she did find was a man who hit on her. In order to avoid any further come-ons, Dazzler left, but the man wouldn't take a hint. Dazzler turned on him, screaming at him to leave her alone. All of a sudden, he was attacked by a vampire. Dazzler fried him, but the vampire escaped. She followed the vampire on her motorbike, to his hideout. She staked out the joint, learning he was part of a gang of vampires that didn't feed on human blood. The vampire was trying to get the guy who'd hit on her, to leave her alone. This saddened Dazzler and made her reconsider her attitude to vampires.</p><p>Her career in Utopia went on. Fellow residents, <a href=\"../../frenzy/29-2163/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frenzy</a> and <a href=\"../../nekra/29-13896/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nekra Sinclair</a>, decided to take a different tack and turn to villainy. They formed an alliance and committed all sorts of crimes unbeknownst to Cyke and Emma. They went to San Francisco to burn down a museum and endanger civilians. Dazzler and Northstar teamed up again to stop them. They told the two renegades that they can't just do whatever they want and that they knew the two women were better than this. These admonitions fell on deaf ears and a two-on-two fight broke out. At first, Frenzy had the upper hand on Dazzler, but she took Frenzy down using a powerful energy blast. The two defeat the would-be villainesses right in front of a crowd of cheering civilians. Which only further boosted the popularity of the two X-Men.</p><h3>Quarantine</h3><p>Shortly after the event known as the <a href=\"/second-coming/39-55971/\">Second Coming</a>, the inhabitants on Utopia came down with a nasty disease. During this time the mutants that weren't on the island were charged with carrying out the duties of the X-Men, while all the mutants on Utopia battled the virus. The uninfected mutants were only Storm and Archangel , with Pixie, Dazzler, and Northstar having been at one of Dazz's concerts when the virus hit the island. The disease turned out to be a mutant-only flu that robbed them of their powers, in addition to making them extremely sick. The un-quarantined X-Men are left to defend San Francisco as well as finding whomever had created the virus. The team first encountered a biologically engineered version of the original 5 X-Men (Cyclops, Beast, <a href=\"/iceman/29-1464/\">Iceman</a>, Archangel, and Jean Grey) that <a href=\"/lobe/29-66244/\">Lobe</a> had engineered from a serum of the mutant genome with the <a href=\"/sublimecorp/65-57964/\">Sublime Corporation</a>'s assistance. Lobe had also been outed as the creator of the mutant flu, and thus revealed plans to patent all known mutations and market them to the public.</p><p>He had success with the more wealthy inhabitants of San Francisco during a party at the Triumph Hill Ballroom. The five untainted mutants battled his minions, including: <a href=\"/bouncing-betty/29-66242/\">Bouncing Betty</a>, <a href=\"/verre/29-66246/\">Verre</a>, <a href=\"/burst/29-66243/\">Burst</a>, and <a href=\"/thug/29-66245/\">Thug</a>. The battle ended well for the small team, until Lobe released the serum to the entire crowd of people, granting the guests the varied powers of all the mutants on Earth. Again the battle starts in their favor, until the sheer number of mutates created overwhelmed them. A deathly ill and depowered team of X-Men from Utopia alights on the mainland to assist Storm's team. As the battle raged on, most of the transformed humans believed themselves superior, seeing that the X-Men were powerless. However, Lobe and the other mutates from the party became infected. Cyclops then forced Lobe to release the antidote leaving the humans with the message that being a mutant means being persecuted, hunted, and manipulated.</p><h3>Fear Itself</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1992406\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/101444/1992406-dazzlerbanshee_super.jpg\" title=\"Siryn &amp; Dazzler Combine Powers\"><img id=\"1992406\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/101444/1992406-dazzlerbanshee_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Siryn &amp; Dazzler Combine Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Siryn & Dazzler Combine Powers</div></div></div></div><p>In her latest adventure, she is thrown into a battle with the Unstoppable <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a>\nwho had been granted even more tremendous power by the <a href=\"/midgard-serpent/29-14471/\">Midgard Serpent</a>.

The X-Men approached her suggesting she join them, but she refused since the X-Men could not give her a recording contract that she required. Emma Frost was then the one to persuade her, and promised her a recording contract which led to her joining the Academy of Tomorrow. After proving herself against the <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>, Dazzler was sent to join the X-Men. Unlike the other students, she was not aware of the Institute's rules and regulations. To focus on her X-Men membership, Professor X mentally suggested to her to shut down the Dazzler band. When half of the team was sent on a mission regarding Longshot, she created a cabal without the knowledge of Xavier. Angel was abducted but was able to be saved, though Longshot was proven guilty of murder and escaped. Back at the Institute, they were confronted by Professor X. Fearing that Dazzler would be expelled, Angel said that he was the one who'd formed the secret team. He was expelled, but in return for his selflessness, Dazzler rewarded him with a kiss and the two became romantically involved with each other.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2529229\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2529229-424381_ultimate_x_men_64_2.jpg\" title=\"impaled by Lady Deathstrike - Ultimate X-Men #64\"><img id=\"2529229\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108672/2529229-424381_ultimate_x_men_64_2_medium.jpg\" alt=\"impaled by Lady Deathstrike - Ultimate X-Men #64\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">impaled by Lady Deathstrike - Ultimate X-Men #64</div></div></div></div><p>When <a href=\"../../lady-deathstrike/29-8470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lady Deathstrike</a> put her into a coma, <a href=\"../../nightcrawler/29-1461/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nightcrawler</a> often visited her and developed a bit of an obsession with the singer.

It's about Gambit making right by <a href=\"/spat/29-24063/\">Spat</a>, stopping her de-aging condition and saving her life.</p><p>They encounter Gambit's fellow adventurer, <a href=\"/sekmeht-conoway/29-14179/\">Sekmeht Conoway</a>, who gets the Tomorrow Stone and intends to save her mother from her suspended animation state with them, but she finally chooses to save Spat and seek help for her mother elsewhere.</p><h3>The Sunset Dawn</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"147580\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/147580-114921-gambit_super.jpg\" title=\"Gambit sailing in the 19th Century\"><img id=\"147580\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/2532/147580-114921-gambit_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Gambit sailing in the 19th Century\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gambit sailing in the 19th Century</div></div></div></div><p>Soon after, Gambit became trapped over 100 years in the past. In order to return home, he was forced to have his surgery undone by Sinister. It was with his full potential being realized that Gambit was able to return to the present under his own power, now having the ability to traverse time and space by changing himself into a entity consisting of pure energy and merging with the kinetic flow of the time-stream.</p><p>Soon after, Gambit was made the patriarch of the Thieves Guild in his father's stead. Gambit also unified the two Guilds into one, the Unified Guild, for which he served as patriarch. Around this time the New Son had organized an <a href=\"/assassination-game/39-56635/\">Assassination Game</a>, utilizing super-powered mercenaries, such as Bullseye, Deadpool, and Crossbones to kill Gambit.</p><p>Gambit found out that the <b>New Sun</b>, not \"New Son\" as he had previously thought, was an alternate version of himself from whose powers had reached their full potential, and had destroyed his own world by burning it as though he were a star. The New Sun traveled to several different realities to kill each version of himself before they made the same mistake he had. Gambit burned out the majority of his natural potential to defeat the New Sun, returning Gambit to his normal level of power.</p><h3>X-Treme X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"315244\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/315244-59808-gambit_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Treme X-Men\"><img id=\"315244\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/315244-59808-gambit_medium.jpg\" alt=\"X-Treme X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Treme X-Men</div></div></div></div><p>Gambit was later framed by Sebastian Shaw for the murder of Australian crime lord, Viceroy. Along with former Triad member <a href=\"../../red-lotus/29-12052/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Red Lotus</a>, Rogue, and her X-Treme X-Men, Gambit was able to clear his name. An alien race tried to invade Earth lead by the inter-dimensional warlord Khan, and used Gambit as a power source to open a portal to allow their entire fleet to pass through to Earth. Khan wanted to assemble the Madripoor set, a group of seven gems. <a href=\"/vargas/29-4643/\">Vargas</a> decided to use this particular opportunity to kill Rogue and Gambit but when Vargas tried to kill Gambit, they were both impaled on his broadsword. Remy and Rogue both found themselves de-powered and decided to live a normal life outside of the X-Men. It didn't last for too long, as the two were pulled back into the world of the X-Men, to battle <a href=\"/elias-bogan/29-45217/\">Elias Bogan</a>. Remy's powers were jump started by the mutant <a href=\"/sage/29-4559/\">Sage</a>.</p><p>70 years from now in Bishop's future, Gambit goes by the name Witness, because he is supposed to be the only one to know the identity of the person who betrayed the X-Men, leading to a world where mutants are hunted down and killed. When Bishop traveled to the present time-line, he tried to kill Gambit, but he realized that he was the same old man from his time line, henceforth, he had to be the traitor. During the <a href=\"/onslaught/39-43814/\">Onslaught</a> story arc it was revealed that it was actually Xavier who was the traitor.</p><p>Unused to dealing with his mutant power after having lost it, Gambit was accidentally blinded by one of his own cards shortly afterward. Rogue then began to distance herself from Gambit when he started lashing out at her. Even though he was blind, he gained the ability to read his playing cards like they were tarot cards, predicting an attack by the Brotherhood. Rogue later asked Sage to heal Remy's vision, which he did.</p><p>Mystique was never around for her foster daughter's decision towards a lover. So she infiltrated the school and joined Gambit's squad in an attempt to separate Gambit and Rogue. Mystique even offered Remy the chance to sleep with her after transforming into Rogue. It is still unknown as to what exactly happened.</p><h3>Horsemen of The Apocalypse</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"118687\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/118687-79925-gambit_super.jpg\" title=\"Remy becomes Death\"><img id=\"118687\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3848/118687-79925-gambit_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Remy becomes Death\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Remy becomes Death</div></div></div></div><p>In Apocalypse's recent plan for mutant survival, Remy joined his side as a double-agent and became one of the Horsemen. After Apocalypse's defeat, Gambit was left insane by the brainwashing, and after a failed attempt to abduct Polaris - in which Gambit attacked Rogue - <a href=\"/sunfire/29-3175/\">Sunfire</a> took Gambit with him to a temple in Japan where Mr. Sinister surprised them.</p><h3>Blinded By The Light</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"961746\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/961746-770542_mauraders_00_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Re-joining the Marauders\"><img id=\"961746\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/961746-770542_mauraders_00_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Re-joining the Marauders\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Re-joining the Marauders</div></div></div></div><p>Gambit had reemerged with the Marauders after being confronted by Sinister, who assigned Gambit to work with Sunfire and attack the Island of Providence where they encountered Cable. After having a short conversation filled with insults and threats, Gambit and Sunfire attacked Cable. Nathan then was forced to use a self-destruct weapon which caused the entire Island of Providence to be destroyed. After the encounter, Gambit returned to Sinister's headquarters where they conversed about their next step for their plan. Gambit reprimanded Mystique for shooting Rogue, since Remy still believed that Rogue needs to survive for the betterment of their plans. Though, it was given controversy that he said that for his love for Rogue. Despite his loyalty to Sinister's orders, his heart still remains with the X-Men. When Scalphunter is about to slay Cannonball, Gambit surfaced to stop his attempt. He saved his former teammate from death. Thus, Gambit's decisions seem to be difficult to understand, and his loyalty with Sinister and the Marauders seems to be more unsure as he destroyed <a href=\"/destinys-diaries/18-44250/\">Destiny's Diaries</a> which the Marauders have attempted to obtain to further their plans. But with the diaries destroyed, their plans were difficult to view in possibility.</p><h3>Messiah Complex</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"961751\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/961751-215807_57171_marauders_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Messiah Complex\"><img id=\"961751\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/6754/961751-215807_57171_marauders_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Messiah Complex\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Messiah Complex</div></div></div></div><p>As the X-Men then assaulted Sinister's Antarctic Base, Wolverine saw Gambit and personally targeted him. Wolverine then tortured Gambit for information about the Mutant Baby. Gambit then revealed that Cable had the baby before Sinister. Thus, Sinister's plans for the baby have not been brought possible. Bishop then attempted to kill the baby, which was later revealed because of the future that he wants to avoid. Gambit then stopped Lucas, and exerted effort on bringing down the ceiling for Bishop to be harmed. Gambit still wonders about Bishop's real reasons for his attempt. Realizing that the X-Men would soon appear, Gambit together with his team mates in the Marauders have stepped out of the scene with the Messiah Baby. The X-Men then made their next step to retrieve the baby mutant as they locate Gambit using the Cerebro. Unknowingly, it was all part of Gambit's plan for the X-Men to locate him.</p><p>The X-Men discovered that the Marauder's headquarters was on <a href=\"/muir-island/34-43505/\">Muir Island</a> where Gambit delivers the baby mutant to Sinister who was actually Mystique in disguise. Meanwhile, the real Sinister was murdered. Mystique and Gambit were revealed to have their own plans for the baby which opposed Sinister's. Sinister was killed by Rogue's powers that have intensified too much being enough to kill him. It was revealed that Mystique is only doing the plan because of Irene Adler's precognition about the event where she must let Rogue touch the baby to save her. Gambit realized that Rogue was not the kind of mutant who would dare to use an innocent life to save her own. The baby was however not harmed by Rogue's powers and instead cured her for a while from those personalities that she absorbed before and still consumed her entire being. Gambit then delivered the baby to Professor X and stated that he would rather be with Rogue than with the baby. Meanwhile, Rogue was still shocked by the encounter and told Gambit not to follow her as she pondered her new future.</p><h3>Divided We Stand</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"710816\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/24294/710816-gambit_and_rogue._super.jpg\" title=\"Together again\"><img id=\"710816\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/24294/710816-gambit_and_rogue._medium.jpg\" alt=\"Together again\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Together again</div></div></div></div><p>Gambit discovers that the Assassins Guild of New Orleans have targeted Professor X.

With Professor X's help, he tried to stop the Guild's plans by informing Cain and Ryking. He tried to also contact Shaw, but it was disrupted.</p><p>Gambit and Xavier then went to a mental institution which held Ryking, only to discover that he had been killed by a brain hemorrhage. Gambit and the Professor then went to the Nuclear Research Facility in Alamogordo. Due to several headaches experienced by Xavier, they have decided to wait, but the Assassins Guild then attacked them. Professor X was then abducted and had discovered that the one responsible for the attacks was Sinister's former lover. Meanwhile, Gambit together with the conjunction of Sebastian Shaw's efforts defeated the remaining assassins. Together, they formed a team to destroy the Cronus machine, which led to Xavier's rescue. Gambit made a very dangerous attempt as he used his powers on Shaw and charged him with enough energy to destroy the machine. After the mission against the Assassins, Gambit together with Xavier went to Australia to look for Rogue who was still affected by the events of the Messiah Complex.</p><p>Later though, Remy refuses to continue looking for Rogue since she had requested him not to follow her and leave her alone. Professor X understands the situation and does not attempt to continue the mission. Remy and Charles then went to the plains and came in contact with Rogue's past experiences, which were projecting all around them. Seeing that his love experience so much pain, Gambit became emotional. Professor X then told Remy not to be emotional, because what they were seeing wasn't real. Then, they met Shi'Ar hunters in Genoshan prison cells and discovered that Danger was the one responsible for the projections, who was using Rogue to seek revenge against the X-Men. Gambit and the Professor then confronted Rogue and found out that her powers were uncontrollable because of the mental walls that stopped her powers from developing well as she absorbed the psyches of others. Professor X was able to heal Rogue. Rogue and Gambit then kissed, and discovered that she can now touch anyone without absorbing their powers.</p><h3>Utopia</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"771771\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/771771-158_x_men__legacy_226_super.jpg\" title=\"Gambit, Rogue, and Danger\"><img id=\"771771\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33806/771771-158_x_men__legacy_226_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Gambit, Rogue, and Danger\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gambit, Rogue, and Danger</div></div></div></div><p>Along with Rogue and Danger, Gambit decides to go to San Francisco to re-group with the other members of the X-Men.

When Gambit thus charges an object and throws it at a target, the object releases this energy explosively on contact. Gambit is able to charge living beings now, shown when he charged Sebastian Shaw, Daken's arm and even a small lizard to use as a bomb. His favorite object to use are common playing cards, although other things will do in a pinch. He once charged a wad of gum, and spat it in the face of <a href=\"../../x-cutioner/29-9654/\" rel=\"nofollow\">X-Cutioner</a> while he was restrained. At his full power, Gambit is able to charge any organic or non-organic matter within his line of sight through thought. The failure to control his abilities in his youth forced him to turn to <a href=\"../../mr-sinister/29-3179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mister Sinister</a>, who excised the portion of his brain stem responsible for his full abilities. Later, while he is trapped in Victorian England, he returns to Sinister to have his grey matter re-implanted, restoring his abilities to their full potential. He uses his powers to return to present-day by transforming himself into living energy, which joins with the kinetic flow of the time stream. After the surgery performed by <a href=\"../../mr-sinister/29-3179/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mister Sinister</a>, Gambit's powers were restored to their natural potential. He was able to use his power simply by looking at an object that he wished to charge, including living objects. Gambit could also manipulate the potency of the energy release and could even exercise a measure of control over time. With access to his full power, Gambit is able to manipulate the potency of his bio-kinetic energy to burn, cause molecular discomfort, incinerate and create timed detonations. However, he burns out all of his power after fighting <a href=\"../../new-son/29-14150/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Son</a>, and it is left back at it's normal level.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"811590\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39442/811590-g__super.jpg\" title=\"Gambit's mutation gives him red and black eyes\"><img id=\"811590\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/39442/811590-g__thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Gambit's mutation gives him red and black eyes\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gambit's mutation gives him red and black eyes</div></div></div></div><p>Gambit is also able to heal himself by stimulating his cellular activity, although this ability has only been demonstrated once.</p><p>After having a card explode in his face and being blinded, Gambit showed the ability to see the future in his cards. A tarot reading ability that was only shown while he was blind.</p><p>Gambit's ability to tap into energy also grants him superhuman agility and dexterity, as well as creating a static interference that shields his mind from detection and intrusion by even the most powerful telepaths.</p><p>Gambit also possesses a hypnotic charm that allows him to exert a subtle influence over any sentient mind. This power allows Gambit to compel others to believe what he says and agree with anything he suggests. However, powerful minds have proven immune to Gambit's charm.</p><p>As the <a href=\"../../horsemen-of-apocalypse/65-40423/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horseman Death</a>, Gambit demonstrates the ability to convert inert materials into toxic substances (such as transforming breathable air into poisonous gases) and has the potential to ingest diseases and plagues. He could control deadly gases as well. Gambit seems to be somehow suppressing the Horsemen in his mind. If the Horsemen is psychically tempered with, it seems that Gambit can again transform into him causing his appearance to once again change. While in this form again he has been able to sense a telepath that was erasing his presence. He has also shown to still be able to charge his cards, though when hitting someone the person's skin turns black (seemingly associated with severe pain), and they disintegrate or possibly get sucked into the card (seeing as the card is still present, still charged, and smoking with energy). Gambit has shown to be able to transform back into his regular form. Remy can also corrupt other individuals through direct skin contact or use of his cards. Those corrupted take on the same black skin, white hair and red eyes as his Death Persona.</p><h3>Other Abilities</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"183360\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4552/183360-72737-gambit.jpg\" title=\"Ragin' Cajun\"><img id=\"183360\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4552/183360-72737-gambit_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ragin' Cajun\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ragin' Cajun</div></div></div></div><p>Remy is an expert weapon fighter. He specializes in the Savate style of fighting with a Bo staff, while he is also trained in traditional dueling and fencing. He can throw small objects with extraordinary accuracy.

He is also a skilled duelist and fencer. Gambit is bilingual (fluent in both English and Cajun French). He can also change his accent to reflect his role.

He was hired by Sybil Zane and Bolivar Trask to go and steal a collar invented by Forge which allowed mutants to lose energy for their powers, thus leaving them helpless. He was able to steal the the collar, but not without being caught through scent by Wolverine. Wolverine then hires Gambit to go and retrieve the collar from Zane for double the price. They eventually get the collar back, but then Gambit double crosses him and takes the collar container for another bidder who'd pay more triple. Lat er, it is revealed that Wolverine expected the double cross and took the collar out of the container leaving Gambit with only the empty case and no money.</p><p>Gambit later is hired by Senator Kelly to steal Magneto's helmet as a symbol of declaring war, which would eventually in Prof. X's future would lead to the release of the Sentinels on the human side. There, he reveals the truth about Kelly's intentions, and in the mean time, woos Polaris, much to Scarlet Witch's disappointment. Polaris and Gambit share an unexpected kiss, planted by Polaris, and Wanda throws Gambit in prison. However, that was not a problem for long, because Polaris released him within hours probably, and then they agreed to run away together. In between wooing Polaris, angering Wanda, and annoying Magneto, Gambit still manages to pull off stealing the helmet. In the end, it is revealed, that Gambit's true intention was never to really steal the helmet, but to destroy Genosha from the inside. However, he still does manage to pull off stealing the helmet, but is in return is stopped by Polaris, whom he betrayed minutes before. He leaved with a broken boat, no dice, and without the girl.</p><p>Unlike other animated versions of X-Men, Remy Lebeau did not have any interaction or assume flirting with the character of Rogue during the entire season, when usually, the essences of flirtation and sexual attraction is usually associated with his character when she is introduced. The character of Bella Dona has not been introduced into the show either, and relatively little is known about Remy's past, only that he's an accomplished thief. It is shown in the show that Remy had some lingering feelings for Polaris, but was forced to do the needful, and betrayed her in the end, but not without teaching her a lesson she'd use in the finale only five episodes away. However, that didn't stop her from stumping him and retrieving her father's helmet, and that didn't stop her from still holding on to her feelings for him either.</p><p>Gambit has also made a small cameo appearance in the ninth episode of the first season titled \"Future X\", his face is shown side by side on a screen with other known mutants.</p><h3>Film</h3><h4>X2: X-Men United</h4><p>Gambit's name is in a list of mutant files on Stryker's computer.</p><h4>X-Men: The Last Stand</h4><p>Gambit was supposed to appear in the moving prison sequence, however his character was cut.</p><h4>X-Men Origin<b>s: Wolverine</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"767726\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33762/767726-gambitwolverine1_super.jpg\" title=\"Origins\"><img id=\"767726\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/33762/767726-gambitwolverine1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Origins\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Origins</div></div></div></div><p>Gambit finally made his full cinematic appearance in the Wolverine spin-off movie, portrayed by Taylor Kitsch. His full origin story was unexplained by a brief explanation provided by Blob reveals that Gambit was a hustler from New Orleans who was captured by Victor Creed and imprisoned by William Stryker in a mutant prison on Three Mile Island. He earned the nickname Gambit because he constantly won money from the guards in card games and after two years, he escaped to New Orleans where he became a popular presence in back alley casinos and bars. Logan tracks him down so that Gambit can lead him to Stryker but during their conversation, Gambit notices Logan's dog tags and assuming that Logan was there to recapture him, he attacked and used his powers to throw Logan through a brick wall.</p><p>Gambit unintentionally intervened in a fight between Logan and Creed, allowing Creed to get away and then resumed his fight with Logan, who quickly defeated him. Logan finally convinces Gambit to take him to the Island so he can take revenge on Creed &amp; Stryker and Gambit obliges, flying him there in a light aircraft that he won in a poker game. Gambit is absent for Logan's battle on Three Mile Island, appearing only to save Logan from being crushed by a large piece of debris before being sent to find the now liberated mutant prisoners. Gambit finds them boarding a helicopter operated by Professor Xavier and returns to inform Logan, who had just been shot in the head repeatedly with adamantium bullets and subsequently lost his entire memory.</p><p>Not knowing who Gambit was, Logan angrily demanded answers from Gambit, who informed him that his name was Logan and that they had to leave the island before the authorities arrived. As they made their way to Gambit's plane, they came across the body of Logan's girlfriend Kayla and Gambit asked Logan who she was, but the feral mutant didn't remember, though he obviously still had an attachment to her. Gambit offers to take Logan off the island but Logan replies that he can find his own way, and the two went their separate ways at the end of the film, leaving Gambit's ultimate fate unknown.</p><p>Gambit was portrayed slightly differently to the comic version, as he spoke with a New Orleans accent instead of his distinctive Cajun speech and his eyes appear human until he uses his powers, at which point they glow red. His powers were also notably different as when he uses his signature attack of throwing charged playing cards, the cards do not explode on impact but merely hit with much greater force, demonstrated when he knocks Wolverine through a brick wall. He is shown to be extremely agile and durable, as he takes a direct blow from Wolverine's adamantium enhanced fist to the face, only to resume fighting moments later with no ill effect, and is skilled in the use of a Bo staff.</p><h3>Video Games</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1977443\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/101009/1977443-spiderman_x_men_screen01b_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man and the X-Men\"><img id=\"1977443\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/101009/1977443-spiderman_x_men_screen01b_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man and the X-Men\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man and the X-Men</div></div></div></div><p><b>Spider-Man/X-Men: Arcade's Revenge</b></p><p>This is the first video game that features Gambit, originally released for the SNES system in 1992.

Although never printed, her origin was intended to be that Rita DeMara was a dead friend of hers whose identity she\u2019d swiped while running from the mob.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Rita DeMara was created by <a href=\"/roger-stern/26-41502/\">Roger Stern</a> and <a href=\"/john-buscema/26-3800/\">John Buscema</a> and first appeared in <a href=\"/the-avengers/49-2128/\">The Avengers</a> #264 in 1986. Unaware of her status at the time, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurt-busiek/26-41741/\">Kurt Busiek</a> initially planned to include her in the original <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a> team which never came to pass.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Introduced as a villain to the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, but mostly as an opponent for the <a href=\"/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a>, Rita DeMara endured an uneven and inconsistent history of sometimes being a villain and sometimes a hero. After her first appearance, she joined the Masters of Evil but then a few months later she joined the Avengers during the <a href=\"/evolutionary-war/39-42181/\">Evolutionary War</a>. Again, this direction was short-lived as she then joined the <a href=\"/femizons/65-40960/\">Femizons</a> and later the next incarnation of the Masters of Evil. Following a conflict with the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a>, she then joined with them for an extended period of time before returning to Earth and allying with the Avengers again during <a href=\"/the-crossing/39-48424/\">The Crossing</a>.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Under Siege</h3><p>As Yellowjacket, Rita participates in a takeover of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers-mansion/34-41036/\">Avengers Mansion</a>, assisting one of the more powerful versions of the Masters of Evil. Defeated, Yellowjacket is sent to prison but is freed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/fixer/29-3282/\">Fixer</a>, who has amorous intentions. She flees and tries to gain revenge on the Wasp, by way of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-knight/29-3172/\">Black Knight</a>. Furious at being rejected, the Fixer tries to kill her.

Accepting her aid in a time of need, Yellowjacket and the Avengers battle the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/high-evolutionary/29-13346/\">High Evolutionary</a> who wished to jump start humanity's evolution through worldwide catastrophe.</p><p>Yellowjacket helps battle through the Evolutionary's underground submarine base, fighting against dozens of his soldiers. Eventually the Evolutionary is defeated by Hercules, the two evolving out of reality. Although offered a chance to stay with the team following the battle, Yellowjacket parts ways with the Avengers and instead joins with <a href=\"/superia/29-25690/\">Superia</a>'s Femizons.</p><h3>Guardians of the Galaxy</h3><p>Yellowjacket rejoins the Masters of Evil during when <a href=\"/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Doctor Octopus</a> forms a new team believing that while the Avengers are busy with the <a href=\"/infinity-war/39-42234/\">Infinity War</a> it would be the opportune moment to attack Avengers Mansion. The Masters of Evil are confronted by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy/65-25956/\">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> and the <a href=\"/avengers-crew/65-59098/\">Avengers Crew</a> inside the Mansion. Yellowjacket was soon betrayed by her side.</p><p>Moments later, both teams were overwhelmed by waves of evil alien doppelg\u00e4ngers. Each member of each team had a double and when one was destroyed, yet another would appear. To survive, they had to work together. They fought until the aliens stopped coming, stopped at the source by other super-teams in other dimensions. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Doctor Octopus</a>, desires to continue the fight, his men turn on him, not wanting to hurt those who had helped them. Yellowjacket was left behind and joined the Guardians.</p><p>She went to the 31st century with them and further proved her worth when she saved the life of <a href=\"/charlie-27/29-2169/\">Charlie-27</a> by shrinking, flying inside his throat, and performing \"surgery\" on a massive blood clot with her stings. She formed a close friendship with <a href=\"/nikki/29-13897/\">Nikki</a>. She later used 31st century technology to redesign her costume, making it look less like Pym's design (she even found a way to fly without installing wings on her costume).</p><h3>The Crossing</h3><p>Homesick, she attempted to return to the 20th century. On the way, she stopped in the near future and learned that a disaster was about to happen to the Avengers in her target time. When she returned to the present to warn them, she was killed by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, who was being mind controlled by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/immortus/29-7215/\">Immortus</a> in the guise of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kang/29-2264/\">Kang the Conqueror</a>.</p><h3>Chaos War</h3><p>Rita was returned to life during the events of <a href=\"/chaos-war/39-56257/\">Chaos War</a>. Along with <a href=\"/deathcry/29-7231/\">Deathcry</a>, <a href=\"/doctor-druid/29-10302/\">Doctor Druid</a>, <a href=\"/captain-marvel/29-1472/\">Captain Marvel</a>, <a href=\"/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>, and <a href=\"/swordsman-duquesne/29-3795/\">Swordsman</a> they formed a team of <a href=\"/dead-avengers/65-57910/\">Avengers</a> to battle the forces of the <a href=\"/mikaboshi/29-44368/\">Chaos King</a> as well as <a href=\"/nekra/29-13896/\">Nekra</a> and <a href=\"/grim-reaper/29-7227/\">Grim Reaper</a>. Rita and Swordsman were the ones to retain their lives after the dust settled, although due to confusing storytelling, it is unclear whether or not they truly returned to life.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Similar to her predecessor, Rita had the ability to shrink to the size of an insect. She could fly at high speeds, and fire bio-electric \"stinger\" blasts. She also demonstrated growing powers on occasion. However, due to the strain this placed on her heart, she rarely used them. Rita also improved upon the Pym Particles, being able to use them on others to change their size.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><h3>Earth-691</h3><p>An alternate reality briefly seen where Yellowjacket returns from her tenure with the Guardians of the Galaxy and marries Hank Pym.</p><h3>Earth-1298 (Mutant X)</h3><p><b>For more details see:</b> <a href=\"/mutant-x/49-6217/\">Mutant X</a></p><p>Yellowjacket is one of the few surviving members of the Avengers following a purging of the team by <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>.
