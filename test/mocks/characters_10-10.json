Saturn Girl was elected his replacement. He served with the Legion for years, dedicated and being a figurehead as a founding member and the first leader even when just another active member. During his early years with the team, a romance blossomed between he and <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> member <a href=\"../../night-girl/29-12875/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Night Girl</a> and Cosmic Boy made enough money to move his family to Earth.</p><p>Years later, a firebomb went off in the neighborhood where Rokk's parents lived. His whole family was hospitalized and his mother later died. This led Cosmic Boy to almost violate the Legion code of killing when he found the bombers, but he spared them. This event also encouraged his younger brother, <a href=\"../../magnetic-kid/29-31005/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pol</a>, to join the <a href=\"../../legion-academy/65-47210/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Academy</a> as Magnetic Kid. When he agreed with his fellow founders that they were getting old and it was time they resigned so the Legion got new blood, Cosmic Boy was pushing for his brother to be elected to the team in his place. <a href=\"/magnetic-kid/29-31005/\">Magnetic Kid</a> became his replacement and Cosmic Boy enjoyed life as a reservist with Night Girl, traveling to the 20th century for a vacation. He would go on to found a second Legion of Substitute-Heroes with Night Girl and the Legion Academy instructors and mourned his brother when he sacrificed himself during the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>.</p><h3>Five Years Later</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"788573\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/788573-rokk_trapper_super.jpg\" title=\"Time Trapper/Polestar (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"788573\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/788573-rokk_trapper_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Time Trapper/Polestar (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Time Trapper/Polestar (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>During the Five Years Later after the Magic Wars, Cosmic Boy married Night Girl. His homeworld of Braal went to war with Imsk and he enlisted, alongside several childhood friends and former Legionnaires. At the battle of Venado Bay, Cosmic Boy was caught in an explosion that cost him his magnetic powers and left him disoriented. He stumbled into an Imsk camp thinking it was a Braalian one and would have been killed if not for <a href=\"../../shrinking-violet/29-12835/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrinking Violet</a> stopping her troops. The disoriented Rokk, realizing now where he was, lashed out at Vi and left her scarred over one eye. He was never aware that it was Vi he had done that too until years later. Once the war was over, Cosmic Boy returned to the battered world of Braal. Lydda became pregnant and he found a chance to take his young family off-world when <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reep Daggle</a> implored him to help him re-found the Legion. The Krinns traveled to the Winath Plantation to make this happen.</p><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"198289\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/198289-74558-cosmic-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"198289\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/198289-74558-cosmic-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>A younger version of Rokk was found with several other young Legionnaires, called Batch SW6. Originally believing themselves just to be clones. It was later revealed that Val was time-paradox duplicates of his older counterpart self. The younger Cosmic Boy had the same magnetic powers and superb leadership abilities. He was named to lead the New Earth team of Legionnaires just as he had the original team. He was badly injured by a stray bolt from Live Wire, and was still recuperating, leaving vice-chairperson <a href=\"/computo/29-27114/\">Computo</a> in charge. The SW6 Cosmic Boy was one of few Legionnaires to notice when the \"crisis in time\" took hold. He, Saturn Girl and Live Wire traveled into the past to investigate their origins and wound up fighting alongside the 20th century's heroes during that \"Zero Hour.\" They returned to the 30th century believing they had stopped the menace, but soon learned that they must reemerge with their older counterparts in order to repair the time stream. In true heroic fashion, Rokk joined hands with his older counterpart, and his best friends (both versions) and bid their reality farewell.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"81254\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81254-108853-cosmic-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"81254\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81254-108853-cosmic-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Rokk Krinn's magnetic skills were discovered early and he became Braal's greatest and youngest professional Magno Ball player. This enabled him to support his poor family. Rokk's fans gave him the nickname \"Cosmic Boy.\" While on a promotional tour, Rokk, along with Imra Ardeen and Garth Ranzz , prevented the assassination of interplanetary entrepreneur <a>R.J. Brande</a>. Impressed by the teens' bravery, R.J. convinced them to form the Legion of Super-Heroes. Rokk used Cosmic Boy as his codename and was unofficially the team's first leader. The government eventually tried to replace him with <a href=\"../../colossal-boy/29-1271/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviathan</a>, but Leviathan saw Cos was the better man for the job and stepped down. He served as team leader the Legion's first year and was instrumental in revealing <a href=\"../../president-chu/29-21136/\" rel=\"nofollow\">President Chu</a> to be a traitor to the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets</a>. He called for a leadership election soon after and <a href=\"../../shrinking-violet/29-12835/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrinking Violet</a> was his replacement.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"199574\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/199574-172711-cosmic-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"199574\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/199574-172711-cosmic-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Cosmic Boy was once again a founder of the Legion of Super-Heroes though this time the movement was more about youth rights and rebellion. His past was unknown, though his family still existed on Braal and seemed complacent with Rokk's involvement with the Legion. As the team's first leader, Cosmic Boy often had to appease the United Planets while also spreading their movement to gather more Legionnaire fans and supporters. Several Legionnaires became loyal to Cos' hardwork while others began to be persuaded by <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a>, who thought he could do a better job. Eventually, the two sides came to blows until the leaders came to an agreement. Cos' homeworld of Braal was about to undergo quarantine and ordered all natives to return within 24 hours. Cos begrudgingly left the team, but ultimately returned at the last moment to save the day. Brainiac 5 relented leadership.</p><h3>Retroboot / New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1093600\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093600-cosmicboy_bycinar_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1093600\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093600-cosmicboy_bycinar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity, from before the Five Years Later. Cosmic Boy had rejoined the team following the Magic Wars and during the crisis of Earth-Man's Justice League taking over Earth became the leader again. He was captured at the <a href=\"/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> with the other founders but ultimately released. At some point, Cos ended his relationship with Night Girl so that he could concentrate solely on the Legion and take care of the team so others, like the married Ranzzes, wouldn't have to worry. Cos, as leader, continued to deal with politics following Earth's bout of xenophobia and the Titanian refugees after Titan was destroyed. The pressure reminded Cos how much he disliked the politics of being Legion leader and he posted a call for a new leader election.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / Earth 0</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2187669\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/99507/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\"><img id=\"2187669\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/99507/2187669-ac_18_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Man (Earth 0)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the conclusion of <a href=\"../../flashpoint/39-56280/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint</a>, the various timelines were united and rebooted once again. The Legion's timeline changed slightly where they still reached out to a young Clark Kent long before he became Superman, but they Legion grew up along with Clark and have changed their names to reflect their age. Imra changed her name to Saturn Woman and her along with Lighting Lad (Now Lightning Man) and Saturn Girl (Now Saturn Woman) reunited with an adult Clark Kent in an effort to stop the <a href=\"../../anti-superman-army/65-58873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Superman army</a> from destroying the original rocket that took Clark to Earth. They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Silver Age:</h3><h4><b>The Great Darkness Saga</b></h4><p>Cosmic Boy leads a squad of Legionnaires consisting of <a href=\"/wildfire/29-3621/\">Wildfire</a>, <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superboy</a>, <a href=\"/phantom-girl/29-1257/\">Phantom Girl</a> and the newest <a href=\"/jacques-foccart/29-26646/\">Invisible Kid</a>. Once they arrive their attacked by their shadowy foes who continues talking about the coming darkness while casually battling the assembled squad before retreating with the wand. Cosmic Boy then gathers his squad and races to London to prevent the ancient sword Excalibur from being stolen but Cosic Boy alongside Phantom Girl and Superboy are sent flying as Invisible Kid and Wildfire fail to prevent the newest shadow minion's escape with the sword. The squad then scrambles to prevent the theft of an ancient orb, but they fail but manage to capture one of \"The Masters\" shadow servants. Following several missions by three teams of Legionnaires Cosmic Boy calls to the worried Saturn Girl, but is attacked mid-call causing Saturn Girl to rush to his aid to find the captured servant to be the attacker.After a short battle however the two are defeated and only saved by Lightning Lad's arrival knocking out the monster.</p><p>Cosmic Boy alongside Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad are the Legionnaires to discover the identities of three of the shadow servants being <a href=\"/darkstar/29-47236/\">Lydea Mallor</a>, Superman and a Guardian of the Universe. Learning this prompts Cosmic Boy to send out a general alert to all Legionnaires. Cosmic Boy then takes part in the battle against the <a href=\"/daxamites/65-42480/\">Daxamites</a> under the control of <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>, being part of the team to distract him as <a href=\"/element-lad/29-1263/\">Element Lad</a> added lead into the atmosphere to activate their vulnerability. He later joins his teammates in an effort to capture the weakened Darkseid, but they fail as he flees. However following Darkseid's defeat he suffers another loss as a terrorist detonates a bomb in the city doing much damage, including to Cosmic Boy's home forcing his entire family to be hospitalized and leading to the death of his mother.</p><h4>Legionnaires 3</h4><p>Cosmic Boy was visiting the now newly retired Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl and his god son Graym. It just happened to be the weekend in which the Legion's greatest foe attacked kidnapping <a href=\"/graym-ranzz/29-52820/\">Graym</a> and delivering the challenge that only the three Legionnaires can battle him this time or he the child dies. Cosmic Boy then prepares to aid in the rescue of his godson visiting Metropolis University to request a leave of absence from coaching the Mangaball team. The three then head to Legion ally, <a href=\"/rond-vidar/29-12860/\">Rond Vidar</a> explaining the situation in confidence to gain a time machine but refuses prompting Saturn Girl to incapacitate him. Cosmic Boy then uses a distorter to assume the appearance of Rond leading them to a time cube as an officer attempts to stop them forcing Cosmic Boy to use his powers on him as he alongside his two friends activate the time cube.</p><p>The three then arrive at the the end of time, with the Time Trapper personally allowing a gap in the time barrier so the three can enter. The three then begin to battle the Trapper's minions in their efforts to kill the Legionnaires,but are captured by the surprise his minions are human bombs which releases nerve gas knocking them out and bringing them to his stronghold.Lightning Lad is then separated as Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy escape battling Trapper's minions through out the citadel and gaining his aide Otok as a guide. He leads the two to Graym as they realize that he is well taken care of that Lightning Lad has been the true target. However the hour glass runs out before the Time Trapper can break Lightning Lad's sanity, as a result he sends all of them home to a point just shortly after they left.</p><h3>Five Years Later:</h3><h4>The New Time Trapper</h4><p>Cosmic Boy was the easy choice when the team reformed to lead again. Even though he was powerless, the other Legionnaires looked to him. Cosmic Boy and the Legion helped free Earth from the Dominators and saved Earth's populace when the planet exploded. A younger counterpart of Cosmic Boy, as well as the Legion from their early years, were discovered and went on to become the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> of <a href=\"../../new-earth/34-57126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth</a>. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> eventually created gauntlets for Cosmic Boy that would replicate his powers; however they slowly modified his personality and drove him mad. Shrinking Violet stepped in as leader. Going by Polestar now, he left the team to single-handedly rebuild Earth. He was subdued, but then captured by <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> during the Legion's last hours before <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>. The whole Legion, past and present, rallied to save Rokk. and he managed to escape, but was lost in a library where time past differently. For hundreds of years, he lived in this library and studied the art of time manipulation. He ended up becoming the Legion's oldest foe, the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a>. The Time Trapper freed his past self just as reality was coming to an end. Cosmic Boy merged with his SW6 counterpart, alongside the other Legion founders, as the last beings in the universe in order to reset time.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247:</h3><h4>Trapped In The 20th Century</h4><p>While Legionnaires like <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XS</a> harbored a crush on Cosmic Boy, his eyes were set on Saturn Girl despite her fondness for Live Wire. She was his heart's desire and after an explosion left he and Imra stranded in the 20th century, the two began a romance much to the ire of Garth's sister, <a href=\"../../lightning-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spark</a>. he enjoyed spending time with the heroes of legend he had grown up with during the team's exile. Cosmic Boy was left mentally comatose after Imra's mind was attacked by Dr. Psycho while he was linked, though he was ultimately revived by Saturn Girl's heightened powers. Unfortunately, she had just been subconsciously manipulating his body. Once she realized this, he was revived properly and in shame Imra ended their relationship and admitted she still had feelings for Garth. He hid his hurt and resolved to reunite Garth and Imra, which he did when their team returned to the 30th century.</p><h4>The New Wanderers</h4><p>Following the <a href=\"../../blight/29-51354/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blight</a> invasion of Earth and half the team being thought for dead, the Legion was disbanded. Cosmic Boy secretly served R.J. Brande as a mercenary Legionnaire while Brande prepared Legion World and the reformation of a new Legion. When the Legionnaires thought lost returned and the team reformed, Cos became defacto leader. He helped end <a href=\"../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s reign as secret president of the United Planets before calling for a new leader. Impressed by <a href=\"../../kid-quantum/29-1520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kid Quantum II</a> during the Ra's battle, he nominated her as his replacement and the Legion voted her in. After the incident, the two began a flirtation that became a romance. When <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy</a> was a member of the team, Cos rode him hard because he felt Kon wasn't living up to the legacy of Superman. Eventually, Earth-247 was destroyed and Cos and his Legionnaires were spared because they were lost in the timestream. After assisting two other Legions in defeating <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a>, he and Kid Quantum led their Legion into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> to become the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime:</h3><h4>Cosmic Boy Leaves The Team</h4><p>When <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a> joined the team, he was instrumental in helping her realize she wasn't dreaming and the two had a brief romance. Cosmic Boy was captured and tortured by <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>, but it was all part of a plan to trick them into going to a wrong location. Cosmic Boy's last and most controversial move as leader was ordering the dying Mon-El to take a bomb to the heart of the Dominator planet and destroy it. In actuality, the bomb was a phantom zone projector that locked the Dominators away from Earth. Cos kept this a secret from even his close friends to prevent anyone freeing them. Sending a noble hero to his \"death\" as well as exterminating an entire race was poorly received by the Legionnaires and the public alike. A public leader election for the Legion was called and Supergirl replaced him. A trio of heroes from the Knights Tempus of the 41st century then appeared to Cosmic Boy. They told him that he was regarded in history as one of the greatest heroes ever and they invited him to join their team. Cos accepted and left the Legion. He never returned, though his war crimes were eventually pinned on <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lord</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Magnetism</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2005970\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/2005970-cos15.jpg\" title=\"Magnetic Powers\"><img id=\"2005970\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/2005970-cos15_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Magnetic Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Magnetic Powers</div></div></div></div><p>Cosmic Boy's superpower is super-magnetism.

He can also magnetize metal objects so that they become magnets themselves and stick make them stick to other metal objects. His power cannot affect non-magnetic metals, such as aluminum and gold, or organic substances like wood or flesh. His control is such that he <em>can</em> manipulate electronic records or the iron in blood.

He used to run with a gang called the Emerald Dragons. Jo was traveling in his space-speedster when he was swallowed by an energy-beast. Fortunately, a Galactic Patrol Cruiser saw this and rescued him by slicing the creature open with a ray. Jo escaped, but his body was charged by the radiation of the monster. He discovered that he could see through anything, even lead. Later, he found that the energy could be used for many different powers, but he could only use it for one super-power at a time. He decided to use these abilities to help law enforcement, earning him the name UItra Boy and a recommendation to join the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. As part of his initiation, Jo traveled with <a href=\"/marla-latham/29-28579/\">Marla Latham</a> to the 20th century to learn <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superboy</a>'s secret identity.

He purposefully planted a criminal record for himself to be expelled by the Legion, so that he could gain the trust of space thieves and then turn around and bring them into custody. Legionnaire <a href=\"../../phantom-girl/29-1257/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phantom Girl</a> was his biggest defender. The two began a long-term romance shortly thereafter. Ultra Boy often worked alongside <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El</a> and Superboy as the Legion's \"big three\" for their power levels and Jo was once possessed by the spirit of Nero because of it. Years later, Ultra Boy served two terms as Legion leader. Following his stint as leader, Ultra Boy was on the run a second time when he was framed in the murder of his ex-girlfriend, <a href=\"../../an-ryd/29-52718/\" rel=\"nofollow\">An Ryd</a>. Jo managed to find the real killer, <a href=\"../../pulsar-stargrave/29-52496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pulsar Stargrave</a>, but was defeated and believed dead at the hands of the villain. In actuality, Jo had been blown through time. He made his way to the 20th century and attempted to contact Superboy, but the merged the heroes' minds together. They became <a href=\"../../reflecto/29-52841/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reflecto</a> and returned to the 30th century, where the Legion learned of this revelation and returned to the past to save Ultra Boy and Superboy. He campaigned for a third term as Legion leader but became the deputy to <a href=\"../../dream-girl/29-1254/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dream Girl</a>. Their leadership styles were incompatible and he resigned from the position.</p><h3>Five Years Later</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1858207\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1858207-ultraboy_whoswho_5_1990_super.jpg\" title=\"Jo Nah (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1858207\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1858207-ultraboy_whoswho_5_1990_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Jo Nah (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Jo Nah (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/39-56080/\">Magic Wars</a>, Ultra Boy proposed to Phantom Girl.

In mourning, Jo quit the Legion and returned to his homeworld of Rimbor where he founded a smuggling ring. This got the attention of the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>, who sent assassins to kill him. They destroyed his home and ring, but Ultra Boy survived and defeated them. He rejoined his former comrades and helped form a new Legion of Super-Heroes on <a href=\"../../winath/34-56915/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Winath</a>. During a battle with Roxxas, Ultra Boy was struck with a bomb that hurled him once more through time. Stranded centuries in the past, Jo used his wits to build a shuttle that took him to Earth, specifically ancient <a href=\"../../egypt/34-55877/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Egypt</a>. There he was seduced by a Lord of Chaos and ultimately saved and returned home by the Lord of Order <a href=\"../../nabu-the-wise/29-3291/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nabu</a>. Jo rejoined the Legion, helping liberate Earth from the Dominators and meeting a younger version of himself among the time-displaced Batch SW6 <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a>. The sight of seeing a young Ultra Boy and Phantom Girl together upset the elder Jo. The younger version kept the codename Ultra Boy and helped form a new Legion on <a href=\"../../new-earth/34-57126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth</a> upon Earth's destruction.</p><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"196809\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196809-76622-ultra-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultra Boy (Bath SW6)\"><img id=\"196809\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196809-76622-ultra-boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ultra Boy (Bath SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultra Boy (Bath SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>When Earth fell under the covert control of the <a href=\"/dominators/65-56539/\">Dominators</a>, and withdrew from the <a href=\"/united-planets/65-56731/\">United Planets</a>.

Later, they were revealed to be time-paradox duplicates, every bit as legitimate as their older counterparts. After Earth was destroyed in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of <a href=\"/krypton/34-30670/\">Krypton</a> over a millennium earlier, few dozen surviving cities and their inhabitants reconstituted their world as New Earth.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"214546\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/214546-122856-ultra-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultra Boy (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"214546\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/214546-122856-ultra-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Ultra Boy (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultra Boy (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-247, Jo Nah was once again from seedy Rimbor and a member of the Emerald Dragon street gang. When he flew his space cruiser into a space whale, he was trapped for weeks. The only way for Jo to survive was to eat the meat of the beast, which gave Jo super-powers and allowed him to escape. Once free, Jo decided to try to become a hero. He was enlisted by an Earthman by the name of <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/29-12846/\">Leland McCauley</a> to become a member of his <a href=\"/workforce/65-47189/\">Workforce</a>, rivals to the Legion. Despite this status, Ultra Boy became fascinated with Legion member <a href=\"/phantom-girl/29-1257/\">Apparition</a>. After recruiting <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Live Wire</a> for the Workforce, Jo and Tinya began to date to the disdain of her mother, <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/29-12817/\">Winema</a>. During a battle against the White Triangle, Apparition was incinerated in Ultra Boy's invulnerable arms. In mourning, Jo quit the Workforce and aided the Legion covertly before becoming a Legionnaire himself. Days into his Legion membership, Ultra Boy became ill and began having hallucinations. He discovered that Apparition's spirit had survived, tethered to Ultra Boy. She was only visible to Jo and Winema Wazzo, causing other Legionnaires to think Ultra Boy strange and speaking to himself.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"169232\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Ultra Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"169232\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7667/169232-189062-ultra-boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ultra Boy (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ultra Boy (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Ultra Boy was once more a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes which was now a youth rights movement. While his past was unknown, Ultra Boy's mantras were well spoken. He liked to have fun, be a super-hero, and didn't see the harm in things unless they would pose a danger to others. He formerly had a relationship with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Light Lass</a> and tried to sleep with <a href=\"/duplicate-girl/29-1262/\">Triplicate Girl</a> until he found out he was being strung along for information.

While on the run, the Legion also travel to Rimbor, where they are captured by Jo in his new guise as the Emerald Dragon and freed by him to help defeat several gangs. A reunion with Mon-el has the Daxamite recall that he worked in the 20th century with a hero named <a href=\"../../phase/29-12983/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phase</a> who reminded him of Phantom Girl. Jo took a time bubble to the past to save his girlfriend, only to discover instead that Phase was actually Tinya's cousin, Ella. Defeated, Jo returned to the future just in time for <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> to wipe his reality away. Before it did, Jo merged with his younger counterpart alongside other Legionnaires to reset their timeline.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247</h3><h4>Ultra Boy kissed Saturn Girl</h4><p>When Ultra Boy and several Legionnaires were stranded in the 20th century, a team up with <a href=\"../../deadman/29-5690/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman</a> left Apparition visible for all to see. Though her intangibility put a strain on their relationship at times, Ultra Boy still loved her and to cement this fact the two were married in a secret ceremony in the past. After merging with Phase, Apparition was restored to physicality and the Ultra lovebirds returned to the 30th century. They were separated twice thereafter, once when Apparition was off-world and Ultra Boy was possessed during the Blight Invasion and again when Ultra Boy is lost in another galaxy with a team of Legionnaires. Ultra Boy initially believed Apparition was lost with him, but he and the Legion soon learned that Tinya was merely a telepathic illusion made by <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> to keep the powerful Ultra Boy in-line. During a confrontation on the matter, the despondent Ultra Boy kissed Saturn Girl as he felt a familiar connection after weeks of her roleplaying Jo's wife.</p><h4>Ultra Boy's meets his baby son Cub</h4><p>Upon his return to his own galaxy after a year lost in space, Ultra Boy assisted the Legionnaires in reforming the team and taking down the corrupt government of <a href=\"../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's Al Ghul</a>. He was reunited weeks later with Apparition, finding that she now had an infant - Ultra Boy's son, named Cub. During their time apart, Tinya had been watched over by <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf</a> and Wolf's closeness to Jo's family left the two at odds with each other. Jo's son was also rapidly aging, though this matter was never resolved before Infinite Crisis wiped Earth-247 away. While his son didn't survive, the Legion did as they were lost in the timestream. Ultra Boy joined his teammates on pushing into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiverse</a> to become the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime</h3><h4>Jo makes a connection with Saturn Girl</h4><p>While on Rimbor with a team of Legionnaires, Ultra Boy's presence attracted the attention of the <a href=\"../../science-police/65-23409/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Science Police</a> and he revealed that they were after him for vehicular manslaughter. During this adventure, a connection was made between Jo and Saturn Girl, whose boyfriend was neglecting her at the time.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Lemnos was born at some point in the 30th century, somewhere in the <a href=\"/united-planets/65-56731/\"> United Planets</a>. A psionic handicap he had would make his brain emit a quantum frequency that changes other individuals' chemicals and electrons related to memory. Hence, he could be in a crowd and be recorded by any electronic device, and after leaving, any memory or trace of him ever being there (or even existing for that matter) would disappear just within a few minutes. He claimed to <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\"> Brainiac 5</a> the at he had to stay within his parents' line of sight so they wouldn't forget to feed him.<br /> <br /> As it is next to impossible to remain completely undetected from everything in the 30th/31st centuries, the <a href=\"/science-police/65-23409/\"> Science Police</a> found enough traces of to track him down and capture him. They were desperate to find out how he had been able to stay hidden for so long, but unluckily enough for them, had already gained control over his ability. Such control that what used to be a handicap was now what could be called a superpower. With this, could easily manipulate the memories of anyone or anything, meaning he could trick an interrogator to believe he was alone in the interrogation room, for instance.<br /> <br /> Rather than allowing himself to become some sort of lab rat for the Science Police, used his ability to spy on them, gathering as much valuable information as possible. Below their [the Science Police] noses, he was able to work behind the scenes to build his own technoempire. He figured that a man with his ability could anything without taking the responsibility or consequences for it...and hence become incredibly rich (stated by Brainiac 5 as being rumored to be the wealthiest individual in the known universe) and also shape every governmental decision to match his agenda.<br /> <br /> Lemnos has one thing in common with the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\"> Legion of Super-Heroes</a> - they both believe that the United Planets is a too slow and dull society for its own good. Which is why he supports the Legion in secret and has manipulated the outcome of numerous government decisions to help their cause. But for Lemnos, the peaceful \"rebellion\" of the Legion wasn't enough. He would take stronger actions to \"help\" the United Planets...even if it meant shocking them out of dormancy by declaring war. War was something could start by manipulating the outcast of the galaxy...the children of exiled criminals, leaved for dead by the UP. They became his army, and they were lead by some of the most powerful beings among them, called <a href=\"/terra-firma/65-47457/\"> Terra Firma</a>.</p> <p> Lemnos's plan would have worked perfectly if it had not been for <a href=\"/dream-girl/29-1254/\"> Dream Girl</a>, who, during a precognitive vision, predicted that Lemnos (although his name was not known at the time) would have a connection to upcoming wars. Brainiac 5 was able to extract the image from her mind and upload it to his computer systems, although on a search, he couldn\u2019t find any information whatsoever about him.</p> <p> Praetor Lemnos\u2019s first target in the United Planets was planet  Orando, the economic centre. Lemnos\u2019s armies were successful in destroying the planet and its inhabitants, leaving only <a href=\"/projectra/29-6797/\"> Princess Projectra</a>, who was on Earth at the time. Not long after, when Brainaic 5 was still trying to figure out who the mysterious warstarter was, Lemnos himself walked into Brainiac\u2019s lab and introduced himself, and told about his origins and agenda. Including telling him that the next target was planet Colu, Brainiac\u2019s homeworld. Brainiac refused to cooperate with him, leading Lemnos to walk out and erase Brainiac\u2019s memories about their meeting. Brainiac though, had already sent a digital message to himself saying \u201cCOLU IS NEXT\u201d, that he received a while later (leading him, <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\"> Chameleon</a>, <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\"> Saturn Girl</a> and <a href=\"/light-lass/29-30997/\"> Light Lass</a> to go to  Colu).</p> <p> On planet Colu, Lemnos had already devastated the planet \u2013 but not the same way as Orando, by military force. On Colu, he had instead forced complete amnesia upon the population, rendering the scientific centre of the United Planet useless. Even though it was too late for the Legion to save Colu, Light Lass noticed that Chameleon\u2019s antennae (which only appears when he is scanning a new lifeform) appeared for no apparent reason. She figured someone not visible was around them, and she destroyed the area by creating a massive anti-gravity field, forcing Lemnos to reveal his existence if he was to survive. escaped, but not before Brainiac 5 regained his memories and Saturn Girl seeing him (hence being able to shield every Legionnaire from memory manipulation).</p> <p> <a href=\"/elysion/29-1274/\"> Elysion</a>, one of the members of Terra Firma, was captured by the Legion after a battle on planet Helegyn. Thanks to him, Saturn Girl could find out where Lemnos\u2019s base world was, and hence the Legion set an investigation team to go there.</p> <p> After a long battle (with reinforcements from the rest of the Legion), Lemnos\u2019s armies along with Terra Firma were defeated. would have escaped if it hadn\u2019t been for Brainiac 5, who opened a portal and stunned him with a seemingly powerful weapon. Lemnos is currently held in stasis by Brainiac 5.</p>",

Retiring from his superhero career, he became known as The Sensei. Residing in the 31st century in the Japanese sector of a united Earth, The Sensei trained Val Armorr in all Martial Arts techniques as well as peaceful creative practices such as meditation, sculpting, and painting. Val became a master of all martial arts forms taught to him, many having their origins on different worlds. He left his Sensei in search of new forms of fighting to master. In his travels he developed his own style known as Super-Karate. When Val returned to Earth, he found that the Legion of Super-Heroes was in need of new recruits to help fight a creature of great power known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sun-eater/29-47363/\">Sun Eater</a>. He applied for the Legion and although he had no superhuman powers, he was accepted when he challenged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> to single combat.

He also possesses the ability to sense the weakest spot in an object. His skill in hand-to-hand combat is seemingly superhuman, allowing him to simulate super-strength blows. His prowess was so high that he was able to take on Superboy when he auditioned for the Legion of Superheroes. Val Armorr is the youngest warrior ever to earn the title Samurai.

While on vacation on <a href=\"/mars/34-55781/\">Mars</a> with fellow cadet and childhood friend <a href=\"/gigi-cusimano/29-51899/\">Gigi Cusimano</a>, a strange meteor crashed into the soil near him.

He joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> as an early recruit, alongside fellow applicant <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, whom Gim gave his codename as the other boy reminded him of a chameleon that Gim had as a boy for a pet.

At one point, his mother was turned to glass and Gim was blackmailed into flubbing a mission, which earned him additional training in the <a href=\"/legion-academy/65-47210/\">Legion Academy</a> for a time until his mother was saved. Marte, Gim's mother, was eventually elected President of Earth and during her tenure she was notorious for supporting the Legion and allowing the <a href=\"/united-planets/65-56731/\">United Planets</a> to assist them where they could. Gim had a crush on fellow member <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/29-12835/\">Shrinking Violet</a> that was not reciprocated, then one day the two began to find a new-found connection and enjoyed a romance. Caught in a whirlwind relationship and delighted to have Vi finally reciprocate, the two Legionnaires soon eloped and were married.</p><p>Outside of fearing his mother's wraith for not having a traditional marriage, Gim was the happiest he could recall. Shortly thereafter though, it was revealed that Shrinking Violet had actually been replaced by a Durlan actress named <a href=\"/chameleon-girl/29-50657/\">Yera</a>. Yera had been hired to infiltrate the Legion and it was she, not Shrinking Violet, who had fallen in love with Colossal Boy. Despite the deception, Yera had been duped into the infiltration and Gim quickly accepted the fact that it was Yera he had come to love so quickly, not Shrinking Violet. She offered Gim divorce, but he refused.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759062\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759062-colossalboy_super.jpg\" title=\"Leviathan (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"759062\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759062-colossalboy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Leviathan (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Leviathan (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Gim Allon's origin during the new, rebooted universe was similar to before with one exception: he was now a denizen of Mars. He was still raised by Jewish parents and was childhood friends with Gigi. She was still present when he received his powers, this time from a meteor that crashed on Mars while Gim and Gigi were in pursuit of a criminal. Becoming a full fledged officer of the Science Police on Mars, Gim was actually reluctant unlike his previous counterpart to get pulled from S.P. duty to become Mars' official draftee into the new Legion of Super-Heroes as Leviathan. Due to his Science Police training, he was named Legion leader on his first day over founder Cosmic Boy. A \"yes man,\" Gim didn't argue even when he could sense the disdain the founding Legionnaires had for him.</p><p>On his first mission as both Legionnaire and leader, fellow draftee <a href=\"/james-cullen/29-47877/\">Kid Quantum</a> was killed by the villain Tangleweb. This caused Gim to resign as both leader and Legionnaire in shame, though <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a> insisted he stay on the Legion, as well as hold a grudge against Tangleweb. He eventually apprehended the villain and served as Legion deputy leader for the team's first year. He had a crush on teammate <a href=\"/kinetix/29-12808/\">Kinetix</a>, much to the dismay of Shrinking Violet who in this reality had an unrequited crush on Gim. He was hard on fellow Legionnaire <a href=\"/star-boy/29-1260/\">Star Boy</a>, likely because he was <a href=\"/xanthu/34-56504/\">Xanthu</a>'s replacement for the deceased Kid Quantum who died on Gim's watch. During a battle with <a href=\"/dr-regulus/29-31020/\">Dr. Regulus</a> early in the Legion's second year, Leviathan uprooted a dangerous gas main and blasted it point blank at the villain to stop him. The ensuing radiation poisoning killed the villain, but Gim as well. He died telling Shrinking Violet that dying in the line of duty had always been his heart's desire. He was buried on Mars at a traditional Jewish service.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296685\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"296685\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, Gim Allon was from Earth but has different ancestry. He was born to a race of giants and had a genetic mutation which allowed him to shrink to a 6' height. This ability allowed Gim to interact with the average height Earthlings, whom he fell in love with, and where he learned of and eventually joined the Legionnaire movement. Gim took the codename Micro Lad due to his shrinking ability, though most Legionnaires called him Colossal Boy due to the fact it seemed to them that growing to his 'normal height' was actually the super power. Sometimes considered to be a little on the dim side, Colossal Boy was still a great friend and regarded highly by many Legionnaires.</p><p>He even allowed the Legion to stay at his giant-sized house for a time. He was romantically interested in Atom Girl, aka Shrinking Violet. His fondness for calling the Legionnaires \"little people\" was a cause of turmoil for his friendship with the size-conscious girl.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1407491\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58055/1407491-colossal_boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Colossal Boy (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1407491\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58055/1407491-colossal_boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Colossal Boy (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Colossal Boy (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>A close analogue to the pre-boot Legion of Super-Heroes was restored to continuity following <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a>. All events of Gim Allon's life are the same as before the \"Five Years Later\" storyline. Gim has remained one of the Legion's longest serving members and is still married to Yera, now going by the codename Chameleon Girl and heroing herself. He was one of the few Legionnaires left on Earth during Earth Man's takeover due to his Earthling heritage and was instrumental in defeating Earth Man and saving Superman. Due to Earth Man's imprisoning of best friend Sun Boy and attacking his wife, Gim had reservations about Earth Man joining the Legion but eventually warmed up to him.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"325135\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/325135-40109-colossal-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Gim (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"325135\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/325135-40109-colossal-boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Gim (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gim (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Gim's tenure with the Legion continued until the team was disbanded years later after <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>. Afterwards, Gim rejoined the Science Police and would eventually be promoted to Chief. He stayed with the Science Police even after the Legion reformed, though assisted them when needed.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Size Manipulation</h3><p>Gim Allon has the ability to enlarge his body proportionately, effectively growing to sizes from his normal height to heights of ten or twenty five feet, for example. The precise limitations on this power have not been established, nor the exact extent to which his strength increases with size, an apparent side effect of the growth. When Gim loses consciousness, he is returned to his normal size. In the threeboot continuity, Gim was actually from a race of giants and his ability was that he could <i>shrink</i> to a 6' height rather than the other way around.

Her younger sister, Jancel, would resent Imra for this and viewed it as special treatment despite the fact Imra initially hated it. Imra became very disciplined and excelled at all she did, earning the rank of a tenth level telepath and being so strong that her mentor, Aven, installed mental blocks to dampen Imra's power. She was fast-tracked to become a Science Police officer and was assigned to Earth despite the stigma against telepaths there. En route, she and two bystanders saved the life of R.J. Brande. Brande wanted Imra and the boys to help him form a new symbol for unity: the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"794642\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/794642-saturngirl_cv49.jpg\" title=\"Saturn Girl (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"794642\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/794642-saturngirl_cv49_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Saturn Girl (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Saturn Girl (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>In the 31st century of Earth Prime, Titanians only communicated telepathically and have lost their vocal cords to evolution. In any situation where telepathy is useless and Imra was rendered mute. Like other counterparts, she founded the Legion of Super-Heroes alongside Rokk Krinn and Garth Ranzz. Her mother was now a councilwoman in the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets</a> and one of the few Legion supporters. When the Legion was dealing with the phantom <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El</a>, Imra was able to hear his cries for help via telepathy, making her instrumental in locating him. Her relationship with Lightning Lad was greatly strained when Garth became the leader of the Legion. After heading several missions where he wouldn't respond to her calls for help and due to a strain in their personal lives, Saturn Girl found comfort mentally with Ultra Boy.</p><p>Though nothing physical ever happened between the two, they came very close psychically and Imra felt guilty. She confessed what had transpired between her and Ultra Boy to Garth and he ended their relationship.

The Legion founders were sneaking inside the historic <a href=\"/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> to try and find proof of Superman's existence when they were captured by Earth-Man. They were eventually freed and restored order on Earth so outsiders could return to the rapidly xenophobic world.

Upon consulting with her mentors back on Titan, Imra realized she was foolish and she really did love Garth more than anything in the universe. They were married and resigned by their own laws from the team. For several months, Garth and the newly minted Imra Ardeen-Ranzz were simple civilians. During an event called the Earth War, reserve members like Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were called into duty. Following the success of their efforts, the Legion voted to repeal the rule against married members and Saturn Girl and her husband reported back for active duty.</p><h4>Imra Is Pregnant</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"850971\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/850971-graym1.jpg\" title=\"Imra with her son Graym\"><img id=\"850971\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/850971-graym1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Imra with her son Graym\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Imra with her son Graym</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly thereafter, Imra discovered that she was pregnant. Since Winathians like her husband are known for their twin births, Imra was expecting twins herself.

Saturn Girl delivered a healthy baby boy on Medicus One. The boy was named <a href=\"../../graym-ranzz/29-52820/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graym</a>, and Imra curiously noted that she thought she had heard two babies thoughts inside her at some point, but she must have been mistaken. Eventually, the Legion founders accepted that the team could stand on its own two feet and they resigned to enter civilian life. Saturn Girl had an unconventional replacement in mind: <a href=\"../../sensor-girl/29-6797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Queen Projectra</a> disguised as the new heroine, Sensor Girl.</p><p>Soon, the villainous <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> attempted to steal Imra's son Graym.

She freed several Legionnaires who in turn went on to free the entire planet Earth from the hypnotic control of the villainous <a href=\"../../universo/29-22717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Universo</a>. Saturn Girl had saved the world once again, deciding that the only reward that she wanted was the chance to rejoin the Legion.

When Superboy died, she plotted a conspiracy with those that were close to him to kill the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> for it.

There, they established the Ranzz plantation and a lucrative shipping and farming business to outside worlds. This continued for several years, Imra eventually becoming pregnant a second time with twins as the business boomed. Even when the Legion reformed, the pregnant Saturn Girl was able to resist and remained with her family. She and her husband assisted their old teammates when they could, even allowing the Plantation to serve as the newly reformed team's first unofficial base of operations.</p><p>Eventually, the Legion moved out and Imra gave birth to Dacey and Dorritt Ranzz. The expanded Ranzz family was short lived. The <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> event came scant months later, wiping out Saturn Girl's reality.

She was the only Legionnaire fully able to resist the <a href=\"../../emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerald Eye of Ekron</a> and was among the Legionnaires trapped in the 20th century. There, she began to fall in love with co-founder Cosmic Boy, especially after he was mentally crippled by being linked with her during an attack by <a>Dr. Psycho</a>. This same incident freed Imra's mental blocks and gave her full access to her telepathy. With Cosmic Boy down, Saturn Girl became acting leader. Eventually, Cos awoke due to Saturn Girl subconsciously animating his mind with her increased powers, going so far as to have him propose.</p><p>Once she recognized that it was all a projection, Cos returned to his vegetative state but was properly revived. Feeling ashamed and recognizing that she loved other co-founder Live Wire, Saturn Girl ended things with Cos. Imra and Live Wire were properly reunited in the 30th century and began to date. During this time, Saturn Girl was promoted to Legion leader. Live Wire proposed to her right before the <a href=\"../../blight/29-51354/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blight</a> invasion of Earth and she accepted.</p><h4>Legion Lost</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296755\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296755-60707-saturn-girl.jpg\" title=\"Legionnaires distrust Imra\"><img id=\"296755\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296755-60707-saturn-girl_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Legionnaires distrust Imra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Legionnaires distrust Imra</div></div></div></div><p>Following the Blight invasion, Saturn Girl and several other Legionnaires were lost in a strange galaxy. On their own, Saturn Girl did her best to rally the team and went too far in her attempts. To calm the raging <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>, she created a telepathic illusion that his wife <a href=\"../../phantom-girl/29-1257/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apparition</a> was with the team. When she was knocked out in battle, her subconscious projections returned and she tricked the other lost Legionnaires into thinking rescue had come. When she was properly put under for medical attention, the illusions faded. The Legionnaires felt betrayed by Saturn Girl's deceptions, even Live Wire pulling away from her. Though initially mad with Saturn Girl, Ultra Boy recognized his last few months with his wife were actually with Saturn Girl and in melancholy kissed Imra. They attempted to keep this a secret and shortly thereafter the team was in a deadly confrontation with the time-tossed <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>.

It should have been a happy day when Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy discovered that Live Wire was actually still alive in the lost universe, however he was trapped in the body of the deranged Element Lad and the change was hard for Saturn Girl to accept. It took time, but eventually she and Live Wire properly reconciled, just in time for the whole Legion to be whisked into the timestream once again as their reality of Earth-247 was destroyed. Alongside her fellow Legionnaires, Saturn Girl assisted the two Legions of other worlds in stopping <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> and went on to form a new group of Wanderers to aid those lost in the Multiverse like they were.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint: Earth 0</h3><h4>Imra Search For Her Sons</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1408373\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1408373-saturngirl_lightninglass_lsh04_battle.jpg\" title=\"The fight for her sons\"><img id=\"1408373\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1408373-saturngirl_lightninglass_lsh04_battle_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The fight for her sons\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The fight for her sons</div></div></div></div><p>Short time after were she paid a visit to her homeworld of Titan and her mentor Aven to help gather her private thoughts. During the visit, a blast of chronal energy from the new Time Institute began to tear Titan apart. Imra searched for her sons whom she had brought with her, locating them only to see them spirited away in a flash of light. She commandeered a Time Bubble to travel back to the moment they vanished and try to read their minds to figure where they had gone. Her homeworld was destroyed shortly thereafter. Imra eventually found her kids, rescuing them with Lightning Lad and Lightning Lass from a zealot of Darkseid.

Most of the population, including Elysion, were superpowered, and this fit <a href=\"/lemnos/29-1268/\">Praetor Lemnos</a>'s agenda perfectly. Lemnos united the people and used them as an invasion army to direct at the United Planets, with a small group of the most powerful individuals, as the leaders and terraformers, the <a href=\"/terra-firma/65-47457/\">Terra Firma</a>. Elysion became the Terra Firma's psychotic field leader.<br /><br />Elysion, with his ability to telekinetically manipulate rocks and planetary matter, easily became one of the Lemnos's mosts dangerous soldiers. Going from planet to planet to terraform them, i.e. preparing them for invasion, the Terra Firma encountered <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Lightning Lad</a> and <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a> of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>, along with <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Brin Londo</a>, on Rimworld 19. After an inevitable battle, where it looked like the Legionnaires had lost, Lightning Lad used an electrical attack on Elysion and his rock pillars to surprise them and win. Defeated, Elysion along with the rest of Terra Firma, returned to their homeworld.<br /><br />Next time Terra Firma ran into the Legion, it was on planet Helegyn. Even though most Terra Firma members could escape, Elysion was tricked by <a href=\"/shadow-lass/29-1261/\">Shadow Lass</a> and <a href=\"/element-lad/29-1263/\">Element Lad</a> to go to the dark and cold side of the planet, where he easily could be taken down. Brought to the Legion Headquarters, Elysion had powerdampers placed on him, and he was interrogated by Saturn Girl to find out where their base world was. Later, he was escorted by <a href=\"/invisible-kid/29-1256/\">Invisible Kid</a> to one of the towers in the Legion HQ to be contained for the time being. However, when Lemnos awoke several sleeper agents, suicide attackers, on the Legion Plaza, one of them found his way into the tower and could free Elysion, leading Elysion to go on a destructive rampage through Metropolis. Only through the combined efforts of Invisible Kid, <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/29-12835/\">Atom Girl</a>, could he be stopped and imprisoned again.
