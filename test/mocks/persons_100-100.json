        "description":" Greg Land was born in 1956 in America.He is a comic book penciler and he's best known for X-Men:Phoenix-Endsong,Ultimate Fantastic Four and for&nbsp;various comic cover.He entered the comic industry in the 90s.After he completed StormQuest, he went to Chicago and got his first big comic, the Birds of Prey from DC Comics.Later he began working at&nbsp; CrossGen in Sojourn.<br /><br />Greg Land was able to move on to Marvel Comics, along with his inker and colorist from Sojourn, after the fall of CrossGen. Originally at Marvel, Land did covers to various series. This led to a collaboration with Greg Pak as the main artist of  X-Men: Phoenix - Endsong.Next he penciled Ultimate Fantastic Four(21-32) written by Mark Millar.He was the one who drawn Ultimate Power written by various writers such as Brian Michael Bendis,J. Michael Straczynski and Jeph Loeb.He scheduled to draw Marvel Zombies 3 covers.<br /><br /> <p>Land is currently serving as the artist for Uncanny X-Men, a position he shares with artist  Terry Dodson. Land and Dodson will be changing places on the title's regular art duties with Land drawing the first arc and Dodson doing the next one and so on. His first official stint as regular artist began with issue #501.<br /><br /> <b>Controversy</b></p><p> Controversy has come up regarding Greg Land's work. Using a form known as photo-realism, he uses reference from real life in his artwork. But some have said that Greg traces when doing his artwork, stealing from other artists, and using facial expression and body poses over again.&nbsp; <br /><br />Brian Cronin of  Comic Book Resources remarked that Land's art in <i><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wiki/Uncanny_X-Men\"> </a></i><i><u> </u></i><i>Uncanny X-Men</i> #510 is \"possibly has the most harmful art to a story that I\u2019ve seen in a comic,\" saying that the Land's limited supply of poses and use of the same models for multiple characters \"results in terrible art and particularly terrible storytelling.\"<br /><br />Not only this, but Greg Land has made the term \"pornface\" very popular. Many female and male characters throughout his artwork have been seen with porn facial expressions and in porn positions. Although Land says that he does Google searches for reference material, he denies the accusations that he does digital manipulations.</p>",

        "description":"Honing his acting talent in Julliard's drama division,&nbsp; Kevin Conroy allied himself with future greats such as his roommate, Robin Williams. Ironically, Conroy was first set to share a dorm with future star of the Superman movies, Christopher Reeve. <br />&nbsp;<br />After he graduated, Conroy soon found, like many others, that finding work as an actor was hard. He took roles in plays and bit parts in television&nbsp; shows. He later went down to San Diego, California to star in Hamlet and A Midsummer Nights Dream. From there, he nearly landed a part on NBC's sitcom Wings, which he lost to Tim Daly who would go on to voice Superman in the animated series. <br />&nbsp;<br />Most notably in his career, Kevin Conroy became the tenure voice actor for Batman in the DC Animated Universe. He provided the voice for Batman in all of the subsequent DC animated shows including Batman The Animated Series, Batman Beyond and many others. He also voiced the Dark Knight in most DC Animated Movies: Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: Sub Zero, Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker, Superman, Batman: Public Eniemies and many more. <br />&nbsp;<br />Over the years, Conroy developed a sort of familiarity and camaraderie with Batman co-star Mark Hammil, most famous in DC as the quintessential voice of the Joker. After the shows ran their course, the two reunited once again to reprise their roles as the Dark Knight and the Clown Prince of Crime in the popular game Batman Arkham Asylum. ",

        "description":"<b><br /><br /></b>\n<h2><b>Early life</b></h2>Mark Bagley was born to a military family in Frankfurt, Germany. He had always wanted to break into the comic book business. At age 18, he joined the military so that he could qualify for the G.I. Bill and go to art school.<br /><br />After his work in the military and art school, he continued trying to break into the comic industry but ended up working for Lockheed Martin making technical drawings.<br /><br />Later in life, he fathered a child, a daughter named Angela, who is a teacher.<b><br /><br /></b>\n<h2><b>Marvel Tryout Contest</b></h2>In 1983, Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter created the Marvel Try-out Book to draw new talent into the comic book industry. The contest involved a deconstructed comic book in which contestants could complete the comic and submit it to Marvel. The winner would be awarded a professional assignment with Marvel.<br />At 27 years old, Mark Bagley entered the contest and won first place for penciling. This led to a series of low profile penciling jobs including jobs for Marvel's New Universe line and backup stories in Captain America. A majority of his work during this time was for the first series of Marvel Universe Trading cards.<br /><br />\n<h2><b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The New Warriors</i></b></h2>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"728233\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15302/728233-bagley_newwarriors_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"728233\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15302/728233-bagley_newwarriors_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><br />In 1990, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz created a team of teenage superheroes called the New Warriors. Given the positive fan reaction, Marvel created a new series based on these heroes and assigned Bagley and Fabian Nicieza to the title.<br />Though not an instant success, the title rose in fame to become one of Marvel\u2019s more successful titles in the 1990s.<br /><br />\n<h2><b><i><br /><br /><br /><br />The Amazing Spider-Man</i></b></h2>A couple of years into the New Warriors run, New Warriors editor Danny Fingeroth became responsible for the Spider-Man line of titles. At the same time, Erik Larsen vacated his spot as penciler on Spider-Man\u2019s flagship title \n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1163738\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51464/1163738-spider_man_super.jpg\" title=\"Spider-Man illustrated by Mark Bagley\"><img id=\"1163738\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51464/1163738-spider_man_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Spider-Man illustrated by Mark Bagley\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Spider-Man illustrated by Mark Bagley</div></div></div></div>The Amazing Spider-Man.<br /><br />Fingeroth decided to take a chance on Bagley, who was a relatively inexperienced artist to be assigned what is arguably Marvel\u2019s flagship title. After a rough start, Bagley hit his stride on The Amazing Spider-Man and eventually grew to be considered the definitive \n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1046379\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51464/1046379-venom_00_super.jpg\" title=\"Venom illustrated by Mark Bagley\"><img id=\"1046379\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/51464/1046379-venom_00_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Venom illustrated by Mark Bagley\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Venom illustrated by Mark Bagley</div></div></div></div>Spider-Man artist of the mid-1990s. His artwork was used extensively for licensed material, appearing on everything from plates and cups to credit cards.<br /><br />Bagley also holds the distinction of being the artist on Marvel\u2019s first web-based comic book, featuring Spider-Man, which appeared on Marvel\u2019s official website.<br /><br />\n<h2><b><i>Thunderbolts</i></b></h2>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"728232\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15302/728232-bagley_thunderbolts_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"728232\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15302/728232-bagley_thunderbolts_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><br />After working on Spider-Man for several years, Bagley began to feel burnt out on Spider-Man. Needing a change, he next collaborated with writer Kurt Busiek on a new team of superheroes, the Thunderbolts. The concept behind the Thunderbolts was that of a team of super villains who posed as superheroes in order to gain the public\u2019s trust. As the title progressed, some of the villains began to realize they enjoyed the role of a hero and no longer wanted to be villains.<br /><br />The title enjoyed modest success and though its sales did decline over time, the decline was so slow and the fan base was so dedicated that the title continued to be published even after Bagley left the title in 2001 (at issue #50).<br /><br />\n<h2><b><i><br /><br />Ultimate Spider-Man</i></b></h2>Bill Jemas, publisher at Marvel in the year 2000, was looking to relaunch Marvel\u2019s primary franchises in a way that would make them accessible to younger readers. Designed as a six-issue mini series, Ultimate Spider-Man would be a title that began the Spider-Man mythos from the beginning set in modern times. Marvel wanted Bagley on the title from the beginning, but, still being burnt out from his earlier run, he resisted.<br /><br />Eventually though, he (reluctantly) agreed and was assigned Ultimate Spider-Man with writer Brian Michael Bendis. The title was an instant hit and soon turned from a limited series to an ongoing series by Bendis and Bagley.<br /><br />They went on to enjoy the longest continuous run of any creative team on a mainstream Marvel superhero comic beating the record set by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby with Ultimate Spider-Man #103 (published in December 2006). He eventually left the title after #111 was published in July 2007.<br /><br />Bagley collaborated again with Bendis on the latter's second story arc of Mighty Avengers. That was his last work for Marvel before he becomes exclusive to DC Comics. <br />&nbsp;<br />It was reported in January 2011, that starting with issue 156 of Ultimate Spider-Man, Bagley will reunite with long time collaborator and writer Brian Michael Bendis for an eight issue story arc entitled 'Death of Spider-Man' which will prelude in February and kicks in with the actual storyline in March and will conclude in July 2011.<br /><br />\n<h2><b>DC Comics</b></h2>In 2008. Bagley signed to an exclusive contract with DC Comics and worked on such titles as Trinity, Batman and JLA.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />\n<h3>Return to Marvel&nbsp;<br /></h3>Bagley is returning to Ultimate Spider-Man starting on issue #156.<br /><br /><br /><b><br /></b>\n<h2>Comic Vine Interviews Mark Bagley</h2>\n<p><i>May 2008</i></p>\n<p>http://image.comicvine.com/uploads/user/4000/606555cf42a6719782a952aa33cfa2cb/963_400.jpg</p>\n<p>Mark Bagley is signed on to do DC Comics weekly Trinity written by Kurt Busiek (with back-up stories by Fabian Nicieza.</p>\n<p><b>Comic Vine:</b> When I spoke to you at Wonder-Con (February 2008) I asked if you were tired of drawing Spider-Man since you decided to go exclusive with DC and you said, no, you wanted to play in DC's sandbox. Who are you most excited to draw?</p>\n<p><b>Mark Bagley:</b> Really, all of the big three ('specially Superman). It's taken me a few issues, but I really think I've sorta nailed my versions of these icons...maybe.</p><br />\n<p><b>Comic Vine:</b> If there was a character you wanted to draw that wasn't part of the Trinity story, would you try to sneak them in or push Kurt into including them somehow?</p>\n<p><b>Mark Bagley:</b> It really looks like I'm gettin' to draw almost everybody I'd like to draw...this has almost turned into a team book for a while...damn that Busiek. I am going to miss being able to draw the New Gods...guess they are dead or dying. I was a huge fan of Kirby's fourth world stuff.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> When the first issue hits, how many will you have completed?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> I should have 13 to 14 done...knock on wood.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> You probably get asked this a lot, what's your rate? How many pages a day? (You cranked out the Ult. Spidey issues!)</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> About $2000 dollars a page...just kidding. I'm trying to average a page and a half a day...I really hate the term \"crank\". I get as much done as I do 'cause I work hard. and have my ass at my desk about 10 hours a day.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Sorry. That's not what I meant.</p>\n<p>Besides the schedule, what would you say will be (or is) your biggest challenge on Trinity?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> The schedule. Sorry, but really that IS the biggest challenge...everything else is cake.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> How familiar are you with the DC characters? (You've been drawing Marvel for as long as I can remember.) Are there costumes you need to check or will you possibly be tweaking any?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> It took me 2 months to be able to draw Superman's emblem without looking at reference. Aside from that, it's just taken me awhile to find my comfort zone with the big three. The rest of the characters I've had to draw so far have come pretty easily (I'm told that I do a wonderful Flash)...</p>\n<p>I'll let y'all be the judge. Marvel has always been my first love in comics, but the DC Universe is really a great place to play. Also I'm working with some really terrific people, which counts for a lot.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> How much input will you have in the story? I'm sure Kurt will be writing to your strengths.</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Kurt is killing me....slowly. Really, I'm at his beck and call. My job is to visually portray his story...there is not a lot of time to hash things back and forth. I do have the freedom to tweak things visually, or pace wise, but much of this is Kurt's (and Fabian's) baby.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> How long do you plan on being exclusive at DC?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> I have a three year commitment, after that, who knows? It is more important than I can express, that I enjoy what I'm working on, and who I'm working with...and so far all the guys (and gals) at DC have been great. </p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> After the year of Trinity, would you rather do long term projects or shorter story arcs?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> I'm definitely more suited for long term projects. I'm not the kind of fan favorite wnderkind who can put out just a few things a year. My strength is really the ability to do really quality monthly work that the readers can enjoy and look forward to.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Do you have a favorite moment or image that you've drawn already (without giving anything away)?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> There have been some really great images I've been fortunate to be able to draw...the neat thing about this project is the scope of it. I'm drawing everything from Nightwing whuppin' ass on a roof top to Superman dealing with a solar system popping up in the middle of Metropolis.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> If you had to estimate, about how many times do you think you've drawn Spider-Man?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Uh...a bazillion.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Is it weird seeing Stuart's art in Ultimate Spider-Man now? (It still is for me).</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Yes and no (I'm such a weasel). He is so freaking good that it is scary...but I still kinda feel a possessiveness towards those characters.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Do you have a favorite story arc that you drew in Ultimate?</p>\n<p><b>Balgey:</b>I thing the Clone Saga that we did was aces...it really was cathartic to do that. </p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Any comments on the retconning of Peter and MJ's marriage in \"Brand New Day\"?<br /></p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> I wish Marvel luck on that...I hope for the best.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> We also talked (at Wonder-Con) about the Marvel credit card with your art, out of curiousity, do the companies give you extra compensation if your art is used for other products (posters, t-shirts, etc)?<br /></p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> No. If I made any money off the art they've used over the years for merchandising I'd be a bazillionaire.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Too bad. You'd deserve it.</p>\n<p>Will there be any variant covers for Trinity? Any thoughts on them? Good? Bad?<br /></p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Not that I know off. Not a huge fan of variant covers...brings back awful memories of the ninties.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> So good to hear. I get flashbacks to that time also.</p>\n<p>What's your favorite condiment?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Trojan...uh no, wait...Salsa</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Last good movie you saw?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Iron Man...wow!</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> Is Bendis a Skrull?</p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Technically, he is a gnome.</p><br />\n<p><b>CV:</b> With the summer movies already starting, who do you think would win in a fight in the boardroom, Tony Stark or Bruce Wayne?<br /></p>\n<p><b>Bagley:</b> Donald Trump.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Alan Davis is an award-winning British artist and writer who is best known for his original works such as * <a href=\"/clandestine/65-42262/\">ClanDestine</a> and the revival of <a href=\"/captain-britain/29-7477/\">Captain Britain</a> (1985). The revival of Captain Britain led directly into the creation of <a href=\"/excalibur/65-14864/\">Excalibur</a>*.</p><p>Davis has also drawn and/or written for * <a href=\"/aquaman/49-9517/\">Aquaman</a>, Avengers, <a href=\"/batman-and-the-outsiders/49-3194/\">Batman and the Outsiders</a> (later called <a href=\"/adventures-of-the-outsiders-the/49-3587/\">Adventures of the Outsiders, The</a>), <a href=\"/jsa/49-6331/\">JSA</a>, <a href=\"/killraven/49-19754/\">Killraven</a>, <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/49-4201/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>, and <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">The Uncanny X-Men</a>*.</p><p>Alan Davis was an early collaboratory with Alan Moore, most notably including the first several issues of Miracleman and the Captain Britain revival. They also produced a madcap humor series (in 2000AD) called D.R. and Quinch. Sometime after this work, Moore and Davis had a falling out.</p><p>He has received recent notice for the [[Fantastic Four: The End:vol:18175]] and [[JLA: The Nail:vol:6167]] and [[Justice League of America: Another Nail:vol:10776]] series.</p><p>-Alan Davis enjoys coffee in the morning...probably.</p><h2>Alan Davis Interviewed by G-Man</h2><p><i>February 2008</i></p><p>Not only is Alan Davis an incredible artist and writer, he is also an incredibly nice guy. He was very patient and accommodating with all my questions. He even provided several black and white pencil images of the upcoming <b>ClanDestine</b> series coming out.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> ClanDestine hasn't been seen since the mid 90s, I read that this will pick up since their last \"adventure\" the X-Men. Does that mean this story is not taking place in the current Marvel Universe? Is this pre-Civil War, etc.</p><p><b>Alan Davis:</b> The Clan are in the current mainstream Marvel Universe BUT I haven'\u0092t seen any of the Civil War comics and hadn\u0092't considered how the Civil War might affect the Clan.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> I've also seen it mentioned both that this is a mini-series and an on-going. If it's a mini-series, could it evolve into an ongoing title?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> That will depend entirely on sales.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Hear that everyone? Make sure you pick up this series!</p><p>The solicits for issue #1 just list you as the writer and artist. Are you also inking? Will you be working with Mark Farmer?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Mark Farmer is inking the series\u0097 And I think its some of his best work yet..</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> The characters Rory and Pandora were inspired by Spider-Man's heroics, can we assume that hasn't been erased by the \"adjustment\" of Spider-Man's life after the events of \"One More Day\"?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Again. I haven'\u0092t seen the events of \u0093One more day\u0094.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Is there a reason you don't read many comics anymore? Time? Direction of today's comics?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Years ago when I used to receive \u0091comps\u0092 from Marvel and DC I would keep an eye on everything and read what time allowed-- but the comps became intermittent so I missed key issues of long story arcs. Even though I don\u0092't have local comic store (the nearest is a few hours away) I would make a trip to fill the holes in continuity only to find it impossible to do so because the comps were delivered a few months after the comics hit the stores and there were no back issues in stock. As the comps grew more infrequent and eventually dried up I wasn\u0092't really bothered because, somewhere along the way, I had begun to read more novels and books. When I do read comics they\u0092're usually a collection of old books in the archives, Essentials or Showcase format.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> That makes sense. Will the Clan venture out of England?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Yes.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Any travel plans to New York City?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Not in this story arc.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Can we look forward to any major action scenes?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Definitely.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Have you ever thought about writing another Killraven story? At the end of the 2003 mini they had defeated a faction of the Martian invaders and seem to have some peace, are they that lucky?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I had no definite plans to continue Killraven but I left it open for a sequel. Sadly, it didn'\u0092t do well enough in the US market to even justify a TPB when it first debuted.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Justice League: The Nail and Another Nail were great. Are there any more nails in the box? Would you want to do another one?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I did have an idea for a third Nail book and, when Peter Tomasi, the editor, said he hated the title \u0091Another Nail\u0092 I partly sold it to him by saying the third series would be called \u0091The Final Nail\u0092</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> When you're in work mode, what's your rate of drawing? How many pages per day?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> It has dropped significantly over the past few years because of a problem I have with my wrist-- but I had drawn as many as three pages of pencils and inks a day when I first got into comics but settled on one to two pages of pencils a day during most of my career in the US.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Sorry to hear that. Do you have a certain time of day you like to draw? A certain place?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> No. I\u0092m very unprofessional. I draw when I\u0092m in the mood or if a deadline is looming. I often have too many other things in my life I\u0092'd rather be doing.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> I can relate to the \"too many other things.\" When you're the writer and artist, do you plot out the issue first or do you change things on the fly as you draw the pages?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I write what I think is a thorough plot, virtually a full script without detailed panel descriptions, but I will inevitably fiddle, tweak and, on occasion, completely rework sequences or redraw pages. Plotting is like having a birds-eye view of events-- Seeing vast tracts of continuity in a moment-- but penciling forces you to analyze the minutia and focus on the cracks.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Did it seem weird to you when Marvel re-launched Excalibur and it had nothing to do with Captain Britain and company (set instead in Genosha)? {It bothered me}</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I haven\u0092't seen the new Excalibur.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Lucky for you. If ClanDestine is just set as a mini-series, would you like to do an on-going series or do you prefer the mini-series?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I have other ClanDestine stories I\u0092d like to tell but Marvel needs to see if it is worth producing more.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Living in England, are you a Doctor Who fan? If so, what do you think of the current series?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I was a Doctor Who fan from when it started in the sixties but this new incarnation leaves a lot to be desired. The original series was ground breaking and innovative but the modern stuff seems like a camp soap opera recycling horror and sci-fi movies cliches.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Ooh, I don't think some people will like to hear that, but I think I'd have to agree. Too many emotions involved.</p><p>Is there any piece of work you've done that you were most proud of?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Killraven is the work that closely matches my original conception which has to be a creator's yard-stick.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> What's your opinion on all the \"event\" driven comics these days? I know you said you don't read them but do you feel today's market demands them? ie \"Death of Captain America,\" \"Civil War,\" DC's \"Identity Crisis,\" 52, and \"Countdown.\" I'm not sure what happened to the days of fun adventures. Everything is so dark and has to have huge repercussions.</p><p><b>Davis:</b> I disagree that there are \u0091huge repercussions\u0092 because the big events are often sound-bite driven plotting that demands an image to help promote a book-- but whatever changes do occur will be dumped with a reboot as soon as the sales dip.</p><p>I can understand the commercial necessity behind the crossovers but while they may appeal to the hardcore comic fans they discourage new readers because of their inaccessibility.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> You've written the X-Men a lot. If you could create your ultimate team roster (maybe 5 to 7 members) who would they be (alive or dead)?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Excalibur.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Ha ha.</p><p>Fantastic Four: The End has just come out in TPB. How did you feel about the outcome of The End?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Space was the real problem. There were many subplots and related stories that could have been explored and developed but the main story would have been diluted or fragmented so I had to be pretty ruthless in maintaining the pace and focus.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Did it come out the way you planned?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Pretty much. I think the only thing I didn\u0092't like about the TPB was that the covers had been inserted between issues when I had written and drawn the series to be read as a single book, \u0097like the Nail books, Killraven and the ClanDestine TPB. I find it an odd practice to break up the continuity in a TPB by inserting covers. It turns what should be a Graphic Novel into a collection of comics. I cut all the covers out of my TPB.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> What goes into writing a The End story?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> With the FF there was a sense of responsibility to handle justly iconic characters with respect.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Do you like the freedom of taking the characters wherever you'd like?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Yes and no. I was given the freedom to do whatever I wanted, within reason obviously, but extending all of the themes established in the original FF stories into the future seemed to have only one logical outcome that was true to that heritage.</p><p><b>G-Man:</b> Any other The End's you'd like to do?</p><p><b>Davis:</b> Infinity: The End.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Biography</h2><p>Jim Lee was born in Seoul, South Korea. His family moved to America when he was young and he grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. Jim began drawing at an early age. His high school classmates predicted that he would pursue a career in the comic book industry, however, Jim instead enrolled at Princeton University where he majored in psychology. His original idea was to become a medical doctor like his father. During his time at Princeton, he decided to take an art class as one of his electives. Taking this class made him realize how much he loved to draw. Jim eventually graduated in 1986 with a degree in psychology, but passed on a medical career to pursue a career as a comic book artist. Jim received his first gig drawing the cover of <a href=\"/samurai-santa/49-20104/\">Samurai Santa</a> #1 from independent publisher <a href=\"/solson-publications/57-384/\">Solson Publications</a>.</p><h2>Career</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"83398\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1332/83398-12021-jim-lee_super.jpg\" title=\"X-Men #1\"><img id=\"83398\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1332/83398-12021-jim-lee_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"X-Men #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">X-Men #1</div></div></div></div><p>Jim Lee began his mainstream comics career working for <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> on several projects including <a href=\"/punisher-war-journal/49-18152/\">Punisher: War Journal</a> and <a href=\"/alpha-flight/49-3217/\">Alpha Flight</a>. Lee eventually went on to revamp the X-Men under a new title after ascending to popularity drawing and writing <a href=\"/the-uncanny-x-men/49-3092/\">Uncanny X-Men</a>. During his work on Uncanny X-Men, he met inker <a href=\"/scott-williams/26-2400/\">Scott Williams</a>. Scott would eventually become his inker of choice for many future projects. In 1991 Jim Lee and <a href=\"/chris-claremont/26-40468/\">Chris Claremont</a> launched a second series of X-Men comics, simply titled \u201c <a href=\"/x-men/49-4605/\">X-Men</a>.\u201d The scripts were co-written by Chris Claremont and Jim Lee, with Lee also doing the art. During his run on the X-Men, Lee helped co-create <a href=\"/gambit/29-1499/\">Gambit</a> with Chris Claremont, and <a href=\"/omega-red/29-9729/\">Omega Red</a> with <a href=\"/john-byrne/26-1770/\">John Byrne</a>. When X-Men #1 released, it came out with multiple variants that connected together to form a complete poster drawn by Lee. X-Men #1 sold over 8 million copies and still holds the record for best-selling comic of all-time. During their run on X-Men, Lee and Claremont had different ideas for the future direction of the title. This caused a power struggle that resulted in then X-Men editor <a href=\"/bob-harras/26-40985/\">Bob Harras</a> stepping in. Harras sided with Jim Lee because of his popularity with the fans, and Claremont ended up leaving the book. Their rivalry didn't last though, and the two would team up again on different projects.</p><p>In 1992, Jim Lee left Marvel Comics along with <a href=\"/todd-mcfarlane/26-3380/\">Todd McFarlane</a>, <a href=\"/jim-valentino/26-18536/\">Jim Valentino</a>, <a href=\"/marc-silvestri/26-15688/\">Marc Silvestri</a> and <a href=\"/rob-liefeld/26-5181/\">Rob Liefeld</a> to form <a href=\"/image/57-513/\">Image Comics</a>. He founded <a href=\"/wildstorm/57-708/\">Wildstorm</a> Productions and launched a number of successful titles, among them <a href=\"/wildcats/65-25113/\">WildC.A.T.S.</a> and <a href=\"/gen-13/49-5667/\">Gen13</a>. Lee would eventually expand the Wildstorm universe with more titles and characters. Most of the Image books were criticized for their high use of violence, sexuality, and their preference for art over story. Despite these criticisms, Jim Lee\u2019s Wildstorm titles maintained high sales.</p><p>Lee later returned to Marvel in 1996 along with Rob Liefeld, to take part in the <a href=\"/heroes-reborn/39-55955/\">Heroes Reborn</a> event. He wrote and illustrated <a href=\"/fantastic-four/49-9462/\">Fantastic Four</a> and <a href=\"/iron-man/49-18800/\">Iron Man</a> for a time, while Liefeld took on <a href=\"/avengers/49-6742/\">The Avengers</a> and <a href=\"/captain-america/49-5776/\">Captain America</a>. With his run on both Iron Man and Fantastic Four, Jim Lee helped these two titles go to the top on the sales charts. After only six issues, Marvel attempted to renegotiate the terms of their deal with Lee and Liefeld, offering them a smaller amount of money for the projects. While Lee accepted the revised contract and continued his work on Fantastic Four and Iron Man, Liefeld rejected the new terms and his two titles were given to Lee. After that period he returned to Wildstorm and also became a comics author for the first time writing and penciling a 12 issue mini-series called Divine Right:The adventures of Max Faraday. This series lasted from 1997 to 1999, the eight first issues were published by Image, the remaining four were published by DC after Lee's Wildstorm productions joined them.</p><p>In 1998, Jim Lee left Image Comics and sold his Wildstorm Productions company to DC Comics. Lee decided to retire from producing and writing to concentrate on his art. In 2003 he began a run on Batman with writer <a href=\"/jeph-loeb/26-40472/\">Jeph Loeb</a>. The series was titled <a href=\"/batman-hush/49-27384/\">Batman Hush</a> and it became a big success for DC. The following year, he started a run on Superman alongside writer <a href=\"/brian-azzarello/26-41586/\">Brian Azzarello</a> titled <a href=\"/for-tomorrow/39-56217/\">For Tomorrow</a>. In 2005 Lee began drawing a new series for Batman, attempting to retell the character's origin. It was written by <a href=\"/frank-miller/26-7082/\">Frank Miller</a> and the series was called <a href=\"/all-star-batman-robin-the-boy-wonder/49-18164/\">All Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder</a>. Lee has stated that he will not leave this Batman title until Frank Miller finishes his run on it, which is to date incomplete. Lee would eventually return to draw his first Wildstorm series, WildC.A.T.s in 2006 with writer <a href=\"/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> which is also to date, incomplete. He has sated that he plans on finishing both All Star Batman and Robin, The Boy Wonder and WildC.A.T.S. as soon as the writers get the chance to complete the scripts. Further cementing his growing relationship with DC, Lee drew the covers for the <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/49-17983/\">Infinite Crisis</a> series, and he also accepted the art director position for the <i>DC Universe Online</i> computer game.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1879973\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82383/1879973-1837236_tumblr_lm33wgou9f1qbujox_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Justice League #1\"><img id=\"1879973\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82383/1879973-1837236_tumblr_lm33wgou9f1qbujox_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Justice League #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Justice League #1</div></div></div></div><p>In 2010, Jim Lee was named Co-Publisher of <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> alongside <a href=\"/dan-didio/26-51584/\">Dan Didio</a> (a post previously held by <a href=\"/paul-levitz/26-41154/\">Paul Levitz</a>) where, along with Geoff Johns, he spearheaded the 2011 DC Comics Relaunch in which 52+ books were launched with new first issues.

This depiction of female characters pretty much defines the contemporary idea of <a href=\"/good-girl-art/12-45911/\">Good Girl Art</a>.</p><p>As proof of his undeniable appeal, Hughes' personal sketchbook (from 2000-2001) sold for $11,200 on eBay during October 2007. The book contained 61 pages of concept art and high-quality drawings .</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>In August 2010, <a href=\"/allison-sohn/26-60649/\">Allison Sohn</a> (Adam Hughes' longtime companion, convention booth wrangler, and artist in her own right) announced that she and Hughes would be getting married. On September 1, 2010, the couple made it official by exchanging a replica of the <a href=\"/the-one-ring/18-56491/\">One Ring</a> from the Lord of the Rings novels in the state of Georgia.</p><h2>Hardcover Books</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1316293\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/65966/1316293-coverrun_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"1316293\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/65966/1316293-coverrun_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>On June 29, 2010, <a href=\"/cover-run-the-dc-comics-art-of-adam-hughes/49-40472/\"><i>Cover Run</i>: <i>The DC Comics Art of Adam Hughes</i></a> was released. It features the cover art from Adam's many years of work for DC Comics. On July 8, 2010, the book reached a coveted #2 position on the New York Times Best Seller List for Hardcover Graphic Books.

He also worked on <a href=\"/finn/29-38183/\">Finn</a> and the <a href=\"/abc-warriors/65-50569/\">ABC Warriors</a> (both with <a href=\"/pat-mills/26-18117/\">Pat Mills</a>).</p><p>Liam's audience increased markedly when he moved to <a href=\"/marvel-uk/57-2812/\">Marvel UK</a>, for which he drew the best-selling Marvel UK title ever, the mini-series <a href=\"/deaths-head-ii/29-41723/\">Death's Head II</a>. Thereafter he began working mainly in the United States on books as diverse as the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>, the <a href=\"/hulk/29-2267/\">Hulk</a>, <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"/venom/29-1486/\">Venom</a>, <a href=\"/man-thing/29-4988/\">Man-Thing</a> (for <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> Comics) - <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>, <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>, and The Possessed (for <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC</a> Comics and <a href=\"/wildstorm/57-708/\">Wildstorm</a>) - <a href=\"/spawn-the-dark-ages/49-20618/\">Spawn: The Dark Ages</a> (for <a href=\"/todd-mcfarlane/26-3380/\">Todd McFarlane</a>) and <a href=\"/red-sonja/29-2439/\">Red Sonja</a> for <a href=\"/dynamite/57-2759/\">Dynamite</a> comics.</p><p>Sharp has also worked on more mature themed books for <a href=\"/verotik/57-600/\">Verotik</a>, drawing <a href=\"/goth/49-20390/\">GOTH</a>, <a href=\"/jaguar-god/29-18379/\">Jaguar God</a> and <a href=\"/frank-frazettas-death-dealer/49-18815/\">Frank Frazetta's Death Dealer</a>.

He has also scripted and illustrated a strip for <a href=\"/heavy-metal-magazine/49-19498/\">Heavy Metal magazine</a>, entitled 'A-crazy-A' featuring Playboy model Tiffany Taylor as the title character.</p><p>In 2004 Sharp set up his own publishing company, MamTor\u2122 Publishing, with wife Christina McCormack, to publish the art-book 'Sharpenings: the Art of Liam Sharp'. Following the success of this book, and together with designer Tom Muller and friend and comic art collector John Bamber, Sharp set out to expand the company and start publishing more work. This saw the launch of the critically acclaimed and award-winning anthology 'Event Horizon', and Matt Coyle's ground-breaking graphic novel 'Worry Doll'.</p><p>Sharp is currently working on the controversial <a href=\"/vertigo/57-521/\">DC Vertigo</a> title Testament with best-selling novelist and media commentator <a href=\"/douglas-rushkoff/26-44382/\">Douglas Rushkoff</a>, and DC\u2019s Countdown related mini-series <a href=\"/lord-havok/29-48734/\">Lord Havok</a>.</p><p>Sharp has also worked on the movies Small Soldiers, Lost in Space, and the animated TV series Batman Beyond.</p>",

        "description":"<p>George P\u00e9rez (born June 9, 1954) is an illustrator and writer of comic books born of Latin-American (Puerto-Rican) descent. Along with <a href=\"/john-byrne/26-1770/\">John Byrne</a>, he was arguably the most popular and influential artist in American comic books in the 1980s. He primarily illustrates superhero comics, mainly published by <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a> and <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel Comics</a>, and is known for his clean, dynamic, yet ornate style, with a strong emphasis on group superhero action scenes, and distictive rubble.</p><p>During his run on Wonder Woman in the 1980s, in addition to the regular action of the series, he also chose to explore topics as background to the main series. These included the growing pains of a teenager, the bonds between women and the cost of celebrity.</p><p>He can be seen as <a href=\"/george-perez/29-11433/\">a character</a> in occasional comics (new Teen Titans #s 20 &amp; 50 for example).</p><p>This life-long Fantastic Four fan considers George Perez to be one of the top three FF artists of all time, along with Buscema and Kirby.</p><p>He also works as co-chairman for the non profit charity Heroes Initiative.</p>",
