Garth, <a href=\"../../light-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ayla</a>, and their older brother <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekt</a> were joy riding when their ship lost power and came down on the world of <a href=\"/korbal/34-56256/\">Korbal</a>. They devised a scheme to recharge their ship's energy cells using the electrical energy of Korbal's lightning beasts. They underestimated the beasts' power and were all bathed in bio-electric energy. After their return with new found powers, Mekt disappeared. Garth left home to look for his brother. On his journey he helped two other super powered teenagers foil the assassination of philanthropist <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>. Brande suggested they form a team - the <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Garth assumed the name Lightning Boy initially, but switched to Lightning Lad.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lightning Lad was created by <a href=\"../../otto-binder/26-42374/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Otto Binder</a> and <a href=\"../../al-plastino/26-39933/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Al Plastino</a></p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><span><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></span></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"489302\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489302-lightning_lad1_super.png\" title=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\"><img id=\"489302\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489302-lightning_lad1_thumb.png\" alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>He was one of the first Legionnaires to be killed when he sacrificed his life to save <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a>, taking a blast from <a href=\"/zaryan-the-conqueror/29-72707/\">Zaryan the Conqueror</a>'s ship. He was resurrected by <a href=\"../../proty/29-12861/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Proty</a>, the shape shifting pet of <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, who sacrificed his life to revive Garth in a lightning ceremony. Later, Garth lost his right arm to a giant space whale, and had to get a cybernetic replacement. Years later, his parents were killed in a space cruiser accident. His years on the Legion weren't all bad. He formed close friendships with <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a> and <a href=\"/sun-boy/29-1259/\">Sun Boy</a> and he and Saturn Girl became one of the Legion's earliest couples following his resurrection. His sister joined the Legion as well. Though Garth lost his arm, it was eventually restored. After several years of dating, Lightning Lad proposed to Saturn Girl and she accepted.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"81237\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81237-155819-lightning-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Live Wire (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"81237\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81237-155819-lightning-lad_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Live Wire (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Live Wire (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>In his search for his brother Mekt he had been branded a runaway due to only being 14, which was a minor on Winath. When his sister arrived to join the Legion as Winath's official representative, Garth quit in shame. He went on to work for the industrialist <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/29-12846/\">Leland McCauley</a> on his <a href=\"/workforce/65-47189/\">Workforce</a> team. Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off. After recovering from his battle with Mekt and gaining a cybernetic arm, Garth worked with a newly formed Espionage Squad to uncover the corruption of <a href=\"/president-chu/29-21136/\">President Chu</a>. She was impeached, and Brande was made president in her place. His first act as President was to eliminate the membership restrictions on the Legion, finally allowing Garth to rejoin.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"322174\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/322174-37608-lightning-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Lad (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"322174\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/322174-37608-lightning-lad_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Lad (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Garth Ranzz was Lightning Lad once more and one of the founders of the Legion of Super-Heroes. They were now a teen youth movement and Garth coined their first battle cry: \"Eat it, Grandpa!\" He was dating Saturn Girl, and said that the only way to successfully date a telepath was to be \"way honest.\" He was instrumental in gaining legal status for the Legion, but forgot to read the fine print in the agreement - the U.P. now had the right to use the Legion's image in any way they wished. When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair. She confessed the indiscretion and Garth broke up with her.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1093603\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar_super.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1093603\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093603-lightninglad_bycinar_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Lad (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity from before Five Years Later. Garth was once again married to Saturn Girl and a father to twin sons, though he ultimately rejoined the Legion when <a href=\"/earth-man/29-32576/\">Earth-Man</a> began an anti-alien campaign on Earth. The Legion founders went to the <a href=\"/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> to find proof that <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> was actually a Kryptonian and not an Earthling like Earth-Man was leading the people to believe, but Garth and the others were captured. Eventually he was freed and Earth-Man was defeated. After Saturn Girl's homeworld of Titan was destroyed and their twin boys were kidnapped but recovered from a servant of Darkseid, Garth and Imra decide to take a leave of absence from the Legion to spend time with their boys.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint: Earth-0</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2226596\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2226596-2148227-2148212-a_21.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Man (Earth-0)\"><img id=\"2226596\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2226596-2148227-2148212-a_21_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Man (Earth-0)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Man (Earth-0)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the conclusion of <a href=\"../../flashpoint/39-56280/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint</a>, the various timelines were united and rebooted once again. The Legion's timeline changed slightly where they still reached out to a young Clark Kent long before he became Superman, but they Legion grew up along with Clark and have changed their names to reflect their age. Imra changed her name to Saturn Woman and her along with Saturn Girl (Now Saturn Woman) and Cosmic Boy (Now Cosmic Man) reunited with an adult Clark Kent in an effort to stop the <a href=\"../../anti-superman-army/65-58873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Superman army</a> from destroying the original rocket that took Clark to Earth. They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact. During the battle, Garth's right arm was apparently destroyed off-panel. The wires seen in its place indicate that he had already replaced it with a cybernetic arm akin to the Earth-247 version.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Marry Life</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"489315\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489315-lightning_lad_saturn_girlgarthimra.jpg\" title=\"Garth x Imra\"><img id=\"489315\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/489315-lightning_lad_saturn_girlgarthimra_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Garth x Imra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Garth x Imra</div></div></div></div><p>The duo were married and were forced to leave the Legion by its own by-laws, but this was shortly thereafter vetoed and the couple returned to active duty. Garth was even elected leader at one point, but the stress became too much and he resigned before the end of his term. Imra became pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy, <a href=\"../../graym-ranzz/29-52820/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graym Ranzz</a>. Wanting to spend more time with his young family, Garth resigned with his fellow Legion founders from the team. Though it was a horror to learn that the villainous <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> was actually his son's twin, thrust through time and manipulated by <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a>, the boy was eventually restored and returned to the Ranzzes. Even after Saturn Girl returned to active duty, Garth remained at home with his sons.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1892563\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1892563-lil41_super.jpg\" title=\"Garth Ranzz (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1892563\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1892563-lil41_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Garth Ranzz (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Garth Ranzz (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the five years later after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Garth had relocated his family to Winath. There they established the Lightning Plantation and became a successful farming and shipping collective. Tragedy struck when Garth's son <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garridan</a>, the former Validus, began infecting Winathians with a deadly plague. His son had to be taken off-world to the planet Quarantine and could only visit wearing a special suit. The disease also caused Garth to walk with a limp. However, good news soon followed. Imra became pregnant again with twins and the Legion of Super-Heroes was reforming. Though the Ranzzes didn't join back up, they did assist their old teammates from time to time and Garth even gave them an old storage facility on <a href=\"../../talus/34-57116/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talus</a> to use as a headquarters.</p><h4>Who is Gath?</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2227711\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2227711-1480041-200px_proty.jpg\" title=\"The mind of Proty\"><img id=\"2227711\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2227711-1480041-200px_proty_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The mind of Proty\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The mind of Proty</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly after his daughters Dacey and Dorritt were born, his sister Ayla stumbled upon a secret that Garth had been keeping: he wasn't Garth at all, but Proty. Proty's consciousness had been transferred into Garth's body and was the cause of Lightning Lad's resurrection. Being a former telepath as Proty, Garth was able to protect his thoughts from his telepathic wife about the matter. Garth assisted Legionnaires past and present in hunting down <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> to save Cosmic Boy. <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> then happened and Garth and the other Legionnaires sacrificed themselves to save the timestream and create a new reality.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>The Death of Garth</h4><p>When half the Legion was stuck in the 20th century, Brande personally asked Garth to become Legion leader. Live Wire wasn't comfortable with the idea and shortly thereafter hosted a leadership election for a replacement. Once the team was reunited, he began a relationship with Saturn Girl and ultimately proposed. Garth and Imra were one of several Legionnaires lost in a spatial rift. Saturn Girl's manipulation of the team put a strain on their relationship. Live Wire sacrificed himself fighting their former teammate, <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>, who had spent billions of years becoming a mad god.</p><h4>Garth's Body Restored</h4><p>Garth's spirit, however, was stored in the living crystals of <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>'s corpse, and he was able to return to the Legion - but in Element Lad's body. This caused a lot of anxiety among the Legion, but eventually his friends came to accept Garth. When Earth-247 was destroyed in <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>, Garth and his team survived because they had been lost in the timestream. Garth's original body was eventually restored when the <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> of New Earth used a special lightning rod to help Garth transmute himself to normal. He then rejoined his team as they pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Electricity Control</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"506307\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/506307-sensor26.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Powers\"><img id=\"506307\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/506307-sensor26_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Powers</div></div></div></div><p>Lightning Lad has the ability to generate electricity and direct bolts of electricity accurately. Lightning Lad can use his power destructively, such as to short-circuit electrical items, split boulders, burn objects with precision or shatter walls. He can also reduce the force of his bolts so that they will only stun. He can send his electricity through conductive metals. He has a degree of immunity to electrical charge; in fact, they give him more strength to use his power. In some instances he has a robotic right arm that is powered by his lightning power.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Lightning Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"196791\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196791-77896-lightning-lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Live Wire (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"196791\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196791-77896-lightning-lad_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Live Wire (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Live Wire (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Months beforehand, young counterparts from the Legion's early days surfaced among <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominator</a> experiments on Earth.

His team went on to become the Legionnaires of New Earth and Garth took on the name Live Wire. Live Wire ultimately merged with the elder Lightning Lad during Zero Hour.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>DC Animated Universe</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"534410\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/534410-lightning_lad_super.jpg\" title=\"Lightning Lad on JLU\"><img id=\"534410\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/534410-lightning_lad_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Lightning Lad on JLU\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Lightning Lad on JLU</div></div></div></div><p>Lightning Lad had small, non-speaking roles in the Legion's appearances on both <i>Superman: the Animated Series</i> and <i>Justice League Unlimited</i><i>.</i></p><p>The <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> episode \"New Kids in Town\" featured him as one of several Legionnaires back in the 30th century.

He had an origin similar to the comic books, though this time his sister Ayla didn't survive the attack by the lightning beasts as children. This same event also left Garth with a lightning bolt scar over one eye, which lit up when he used his powers. During the two seasons of the show, Garth had a flirtation with Saturn Girl but never properly developed a romance. He often butted heads with fellow co-founder Cosmic Boy on issues and Saturn Girl specifically. He appeared in every episode of season one and all but \"Cry Wolf\", \"Unnatural Alliances\", and \"Trials\" in season two.</p><p>In season one, Garth joined the Legion of Super-Villains to be with his brother Mekt and leave behind his immature Legion teammates but quickly learned the team wasn't for him. In season two, Garth lost his arm to his brother and <a href=\"/imperiex/29-10006/\">Imperiex</a> and was given a cybernetic one.

Naltor's native denizens are genetically inclined to be precognitives, with the ability to see into the future. At a young age, Nura became recognized as the most powerful precog among her people, more able to dream with peculiar accuracy, or see a few moments into the future while awake, than any other. Nura's exceptional beauty often hid the fact that she was also exceptionally bright, and once she reached adulthood, she had already mastered advanced Naltorian science, putting her among the galaxy's intellectual elite. Nura eventually left Naltor to act on one her visions in which she foresaw the death of several members of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> on a mission in space. Determined to prevent their deaths, she introduced herself to the Legion using the code name of Dream Girl.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dream Girl was created in 1964 by writer <a href=\"/edmond-hamilton/26-42401/\">Edmond Hamilton</a> and artist <a href=\"/john-forte/26-7532/\">John Forte</a>, first appearing in <a href=\"/adventure-comics/49-3105/\">Adventure Comics</a> #310. She became the sixth female member of the Legion of Super-Heroes and their 20th member overall. As her code name would suggest, Dream Girl was portrayed as the most glamorous member of the Legion, and she was envisioned as a <a href=\"../../marilyn-monroe/29-16582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marilyn Monroe</a>-like beauty complete with platinum-blonde hair, revealing silver costumes, high heels, and a star-shaped birthmark on her right cheek. Despite her looks, Dream Girl was also conceived to be one of the Legion's most intelligent and capable members.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"495653\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/495653-dreamgirlguice_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Pre-Crisis)\"><img id=\"495653\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/495653-dreamgirlguice_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Pre-Crisis)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Pre-Crisis)</div></div></div></div><p>Nura knew from her vision that several of the Legionnaires would face death in an explosion in space if they remained members of the team. At oen of the Legion's open try-outs, Nura introduced herself as Dream Girl, gaining the attention of the male Legionnaires and the ire of the female Legionnaires. One Legionnaire fell in love with her at first sight, <a href=\"/starman/29-1260/\">Star Boy</a>. The male Legionnaires voted her in to the team. Immediately, Dream Girl studied the Legion Constitution, to discover ways to expel the doomed Legionnaires from the team. One by one, she sabotaged them, including <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Lightning Lass</a>, who had her electrical powers seemingly removed by Nura's Naltorian science. The vision Nura had, turned out to be a vision of a test the Legion was doing with crash test dummies that looked like the Legionnaires. Dream Girl also revealed that Lightning Lass' powers had changed from electrical control to the nullification of gravity.</p><p>Once the truth of Dream Girl's scheme came out, the Legionnaires invited Dream Girl to stay on the team because she had their best interests in mind. Dream Girl declined the invitation, deciding instead to get more training in her abilities. Dream Girl joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> so she would have time to practice and perfect her visions. Later, after Star Boy lost his kryptonian-level powers, and followed her to the Substitute Legion and started their romance. Finally, when it appeared that <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> and <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superboy</a> were leaving the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy and Dream Girl rejoined the team.</p><p>With her stunning pinup-girl looks and figure, a flirty swimsuit-like costume (which she wore even prior to the Legion's sexy-costume era of the 70's), and boldly confident personality, the male Legionnaires completely stopped noticing the other female members on the team, and the female Legionnaires soon grew jealous and resentful. Never one to back down from a challenge, Dream Girl made an effort to reach out to her female teammates, gradually winning them over and befriending them with her natural charm and charisma.</p><p>Dream Girl became leader of the Legion during the <a href=\"/great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\">Great Darkness Saga</a>, performing admirably and unexpectedly well, due to her amazing intelligence and charisma. At one point, Dream Girl cheated on Star Boy. He left the team in response to become planetary champion of his home planet, <a href=\"/xanthu/34-56504/\">Xanthu</a>. Dream Girl then began a relationship with <a href=\"/atmos/29-28222/\">Atmos</a>, Xanthu's former champion. Realizing Atmos may have been mentally manipulating her, she knocked him out cold with one punch and went back home to the Legion.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"268337\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/268337-4124-dream-girl_super.jpg\" title=\"Dreamer (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"268337\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/268337-4124-dream-girl_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dreamer (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dreamer (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Nura claimed that her name was Nura Schappin, changing her surname to Nal because, as she put it, \"It just says I'm from Naltor y'know.\" She also claimed to have been the first precognitive to be born on Naltor in seven generations, a claim that was later contradicted by other post-<i>Zero Hour</i> Legion stories. For most of this continuity's duration, Nura was not a Legionnaire, although she was still Star Boy's girlfriend. Additionally, she suffered from narcolepsy, falling unconscious whenever she had a vision. She was no longer the sister of <a href=\"/black-witch/29-30998/\">Mysa</a>, who was completely unrelated to her in this continuity. Eventually, Nura gained Legion membership under the codename Dreamer.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1327693\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1327693-dreamgirl_stasis_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"1327693\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1327693-dreamgirl_stasis_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Dream Girl stopped an assassination attempt on the United Planets delegates by a spy. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> had compiled data for three days and sent Dream Girl, <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid</a>, and <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a> to stop the assassin. The Legionnaires looked like they were beaten, until Karate Kid woke Dream Girl from a daydream and she took down the assassin down with ease, saying that she thought they had already defeated him. Afterwards, Brainiac 5 announced that Dream Girl's precog power frustrated him to no end because there was no rationality to it and it was not scientific. Dream Girl then interrupted Brainy, talking about a conversation they had not had yet, frustrating him even further. Later, Dream Girl, Karate Kid, <a href=\"../../shadow-lass/29-1261/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Lass</a> and Brainiac 5 were all sent to Dream Girl's home planet of Naltor to investigate why no one under the age of 18 was able to sleep.</p><p>Brainiac 5 eventually realized that he was in love with her, right before she was killed in the battle that destroyed most of the Legion Headquarters. He stopped her soul from escaping, and she went to live only in Brainiac's mind while he tried to figure out a way to restore her body.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1574192\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3347/1574192-lsheroes_cv11_02_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1574192\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3347/1574192-lsheroes_cv11_02_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>Dream Girl's story pick up before the Five Years Later, the Legion mysteriously returned in the 21st Century, including the original Dream Girl. Members of the team were scattered and trapped in different places throughout the universe. Dream Girl herself had been captured and imprisoned by the nightmarish villain <a href=\"../../doctor-destiny/29-10453/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Destiny</a> in <a href=\"../../arkham-asylum/34-31682/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arkham Asylum</a>, where her precognitive powers were manipulated into giving her horrific illusions. She was rescued by the <a href=\"../../justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Justice Society</a> and <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League</a>, and was reunited with her longtime love Thom Kallor (formerly Star Boy), who had been flung back in time to become the new <a href=\"../../starman/29-7646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Starman</a>. In this revised history the relationship between the two was more tragic, since Starman suffered mental damage after being hurtled back through time unprepared.</p><p>She felt terribly for him and believed that the 21st-century methods of treating his mental illness were barbaric. Dream Girl has since established a connection to the realm of '<a href=\"/the-dreaming/34-55857/\">The Dreaming</a>,' further enhancing her precognitive powers. She also correctly predicted the threat of <a href=\"../../superman-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> in <a href=\"../../final-crisis/39-51642/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Final Crisis</a>: <a href=\"../../final-crisis-legion-of-three-worlds/49-22674/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Three Worlds</a>, the recent storyline which united all three versions of the Legion together. After the <a href=\"/last-stand-of-new-krypton/39-56041/\">war</a> with <a href=\"/new-krypton/34-56084/\">New Krypton</a> in the 21st century, Dream Girl was able to bring Star Boy back home to the 31st century to get him the medical treatment he needed.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>Dream Girl x Star Boy</h4><p>Though Nura continued to receive constant attention from the unattached male Legionnaires (and even some of the attached ones), <a href=\"../../star-boy/29-1260/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Star Boy</a> (Thom Kallor) was the one who eventually managed to capture her heart. Nura became very close to him and she was romantically involved with Star Boy for many years. Dream Girl spent several years as someone who needed to be rescued, partly due to her effective but non-combative power. Not wanting to be a liability she trained intensively in hand-to-hand combat in order to better serve the team on the field. She was a quick study and became a highly skilled martial artist, second on the team in unarmed combat to only <a href=\"../../karate-kid/29-1269/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Karate Kid.</a> Her precognitive power to foresee an opponent's moves before they even made them further enhanced her effectiveness as a fighter.</p><h4>Dream Girl Leaves The Legion</h4><p>At one point Nura took a temporary leave from the team, since she believed she had initially joined under false pretenses. She had foreseen the deaths of some Legionnaires while dreaming and proceeded to get those Legionnaires expelled from the Legion in order to save their lives. During this time she joined the <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> until she reunited with Star Boy, who had been previously expelled from the Legion for accidentally killing Nura's former lover, a Naltorian named Kenz Nahor, in self-defense after Nahor attempted to kill Star Boy out of jealousy.</p><h4>Dream Girl vs. Universo</h4><p>She is also one of the few Legion members who have demonstrated sufficient willpower to utilize her Legion Flight Ring on an object other than herself, effectively giving her the ability of telekinesis. She is also one of four Legionnaires that <a href=\"/universo/29-22717/\">Universo</a> thought were there the most dangerous to his attempt to control the Earth (along with Saturn Girl, Brainiac 5, and Chameleon Boy). The four assumed that they were isolated as the most dangerous because they were the smartest Legionnaires, but it also could have been that those four had the most resistance to Universo's mind control - even more than the Legion's (then current) telepath, <a href=\"/tellus/29-30996/\">Tellus</a>.</p><h4>Dream Girl Elected as Leader</h4><p>Dream Girl soon rejoined the Legion and continued serving as a highly valued member. After <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lad</a>'s term as Legion leader went horribly awry, the team decided it was time to elect a new leader, and Dream Girl announced that she was officially running for the position. The other candidates initially scoffed at the idea of the Legion's glamour girl winning the job, until they realized to their dismay that she would not have announced her candidacy had she not already foreseen herself winning. Sure enough, Dream Girl was elected leader, becoming only the second female Legionnaire ever to do so (after <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>).</p><h4>Dream Girl x Atmos</h4><p>Shortly after she assumed leadership the Legion was faced with one of the most dire challenges in their history -- the <a href=\"../../great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Great Darkness Saga</a>. The ancient super-villain <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a> appeared in the 30th century and attempted to conquer the whole of the United Planets. He very nearly succeeded, but the Legion, with Dream Girl's able leadership, finally managed to thwart him after an epic and costly struggle. During this time Nura's sister, Mysa Nal, arrived to aid the team with her mastery of the magical arts. Afterwards Mysa became a Legionnaire, calling herself the <a href=\"../../white-witch/29-30998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Witch</a>. Though she ran for leader again the next year, she lost out to Element Lad. Star Boy made no effort to hide his satisfaction about this result. During her stint as leader, their relationship suffered. She started flirting more in the public eye. This made Thom upset at this and he decided to return to his home planet, Xanthu. She had a brief romance with <a href=\"../../atmos/29-28222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atmos</a> of Xanthu and broke up with Thom, then the truth becomes apparent to her that Atmos somehow taking over her emotions and sapping her will. She slowly building up a tolerance to Atmos mind-sapping powers. Then one night when Atmos had falls asleep, she regains herself enough to click her flight-ring alarm and she ran back to Thorm.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1888499\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888499-dg30_super.jpg\" title=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1888499\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888499-dg30_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"High Seer (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">High Seer (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>During the five years after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a> she left the Legion, when the collapse of the galactic economy and Earthgov's hostility toward the Legion made her return to Naltor to be its High Seer. She steered Naltor successfully through the troubled times, and its is now, under her leadership, one of the most stable economies in the United Planets. Alone and missing Star Boy, Dream Girl turned to several men during this time. In early 2996, after a flash of light that seemed to indicate some sort of time-flux, Dream Girl joined her former teammates on Earth, and just before the destruction of the time line, shared a kiss with Star Boy before they were wiped out of existence due to the <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> event.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>Dream Girl Leads Her Team</h4><p>On Naltro, the Legionnaires brought a crazed teen before the high council and Dream Girl demanded to know what was being done to fix the problem. She also explained that without dreams, Naltorians could not interpret their visions and would eventually lose their precognitive abilities. The high council of Nltro claimed that the lack of sleep was a disease and not to worry, since it would work itself out. After it was discovered that it was actually the adults committing the crime against the children, Brainiac 5 took off, leaving the other three Legionnaires to fight the Precommandos (Precog Cops). The cops lay a beating on Karate Kid and Shadow Lass, until Dream Girl distracted the police so that they focused their attention solely on her. Taking advantage of the distraction, her teammates took the cops down. Dream Girl knew that more precogs were on the way, but she also knew that there was something the high council did not want the kids to see. She tried to get Karate Kid to knock her out but he refused, so Shadow Lass blindsided her with a mean right hand. Dream Girl then viewed the Destruction of the Universe by an unknown enemy and his army. When she woke up she said one word... 'Brainy'. Dream Girl lead the team to the public service broadcaster ,where they found Brainy \"attacking the problem\" as he put. It came down to Dream Girl having to choose either to let the youth know what she saw and how little time they had left, or security and comfort. She chose the former.</p><h4>Dream Girl x Brainiac 5?</h4><p>When the team returned to Legion headquarters, Brainiac 5 explained to Dream Girl how all it would take was one person, one casualty to have the willpower to break destiny; that the universe was more unpredictable than they gave it credit for and her visions did not have to be infallible. Dream Girl told him he would feel differently once they were married.</p><h4>The Death of Dream Girl</h4><p>After this the Legion's true enemy was revealed: The terrorist group called <a href=\"../../terra-firma/65-47457/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Firma</a>, lead by the super-powered <a href=\"../../elysion/29-1274/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elysion</a> and <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a>. Terra Firma attacked the planet Helegyn. During this attack Dream girl had a vision but could not see past one hour; after that, all she saw was black. After Elysion was captured, Dream Girl took out her frustrations on him. As she did so, Dream Girl expressed faith, something unheard of for precogs. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl had a romantic moment while he tried to figure out her problem. Then Terra Firma made their move, just as Dream Girl had foreseen. They suicide-bombed Legion Tower and the plaza where teens had gathered to support the Legion. Brainiac 5 and Dream Girl headed there. Elysion escaped and, using his earth-controlling powers, brought down Legion Tower on top of everyone around. Amid the chaos, the answer to Dream Girl's problem was answered... she could not see past her own death. Dream Girl was crushed in the rubble of Legion Tower.</p><h4>The Return of Dream Girl</h4><p>After she died, Brainiac 5 activated his force field around her dug-out body, which was still in remarkably good condition despite its physical death. Later it was revealed that Brainiac 5 had placed Dream Girl's body in stasis and was using a captured Lemnos try to bring her back to life. At the end of the story arc, he was shown to be successful: Nura's consciousness was transferred into a newly cloned version of her original body with her powers and sight fully restored. In the final issue of this continuity, the happy pair announced to the rest of the team their plans to get married.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>The New 52</h4><p>The effort of DC to revitalize its titles led to the new 52 in which all the titles were relaunched simultaneously. Legion of Super Heroes was not as changed as other titles but it remains to be the extent of any changes between the old series and new. Dream Girl and <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> still appear to have a strong relationship, though to what degree has not been indicated.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Precognition</h3><p>Dream Girl has the ability to see the future in dreams and visions. This is a power shared by all natives of her home planet Naltor, though Nura's ability to do so is considered to be among the strongest of her race. In addition to the long-range precognition of her dreams, Dream Girl also has the power of short term precognition when in a conscious state, allowing her to see a few seconds into the future at any given moment.</p><p><b>Unarmed Combat</b></p><p>Dream Girls spent the early period of her portrayal as a character that often needed to be rescued. She resolved to change that and spent long hours with the Legion's ultimate martial arts master, Karate Kid, who has given Dream Girl extensive training in hand-to-hand combat. She was one of his most gifted students, to the point where she is the second-most skilled martial artist on the team. Her fighting ability is greatly enhanced by her power to see seconds into the future, which allows her to predict her opponent's moves even before they make them and map out a battle before it actually begins. This makes her a very formidable tactician, and she is able to successfully combat enemies physically far stronger than her, such as the <a>Persuader</a>.</p><h3>Intellect</h3><p>Nura also possesses a genius-level intellect, and has mastered the highly advanced principles of Naltorian Science. She is one of the few legionairres to have received a compliment from Brainiac 5 for intellectual prowess. She was also given special treatment by the villian Universo, as one of the four biggest threats to his domination of Earth (along with <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a>, <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, and Brainiac 5).</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Dream Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring. Dream Girl has used the ring in various ways unknown to other Legionnaires. Using her strong willpower, Nura can use the flight ring to levitate and move other objects nearby, as if she has telekinesis.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1888505\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888505-dg31_super.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"1888505\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1888505-dg31_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>The devastation of the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/39-56080/\">Magic Wars</a> caused original Legion continuity to jump ahead five years in what is now known as the Five Year Gap.

They were later revealed to be time-paradox duplicates of the original Legion, rather than clones. They operated separately from the original Legion and formed their own team, the <a href=\"/legionnaires/65-56923/\">Legionnaires</a>, and starred in their own series with that title. All of the Legionnaires except for Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl, <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Live Wire</a> and Invisible Kid seemed to think that Dream Girl was part of the team the entire time...but she wasn't and her existence, which remained stable until she joined with her adult counterpart and disappeared at the end of the universe, was a blip in time caused by Zero Hour.</p><h3>Superboy's Legion</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2415132\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2415132-dreamgirl_superboys_legion.jpg\" title=\"Dream Girl (Superboy's Legion)\"><img id=\"2415132\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2415132-dreamgirl_superboys_legion_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Dream Girl (Superboy's Legion)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dream Girl (Superboy's Legion)</div></div></div></div><p>Dream Girl appeared as a member of the Legion in <a href=\"/superboys-legion/49-21245/\">Superboy's Legion</a>, an <a href=\"/elseworlds/12-46699/\">Elseworlds</a> story.

After centuries of disuse, the title \"Brainiac\" was taken by Querl's father, and eventually was given to Querl at the age of twelve. He was the fifth to ever hold the title. Making many breakthroughs in the science of time travel during university as a young boy thanks to his mentor <a href=\"../../circadia-senius/29-48002/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Circadia Senius</a>, Querl was invited to join the Time Institute in <a href=\"../../metropolis/34-41184/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Metropolis</a> on Earth. He became close friends with fellow time genius, <a href=\"../../rond-vidar/29-12860/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rond Vidar</a>. He invented the <a href=\"../../time-bubble/18-47355/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Bubble</a>, which became the primary mode of time travel for the Legion of Super-Heroes. While using a Time Viewer to see the dawn of time, the <a href=\"../../green-lantern-corps/65-6992/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Lantern Corps</a> attacked him, but he was saved by the newly formed Legion of Super-Heroes. Impressed by the team, and using his code-name of Brainiac 5, he tried out and joined the Legion alongside <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>. He went on to collaborate with the first <a href=\"../../invisible-kid/29-1256/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invisible Kid</a>, Lyle Norg, to invent the <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Rings</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Brainiac 5 was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/26-40754/\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/jim-mooney/26-15983/\">Jim Mooney</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"596021\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30247/596021-jla2005_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\"><img id=\"596021\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/30247/596021-jla2005_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>Brainiac 5 is usually portrayed as being anti-social, cold towards others, aloof and self-involved. The reasoning for this is his heightened intelligence which always surpasses those around him, making it difficult for him to relate communication his point to others. Through sensible, appropriate dialogue, Brainiac 5 found he had to \"dumb down\" his conversations so his peers could understand his ramblings. Still Brainiac 5 has shown a dedicated valor to his friends and the <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion</a>, he has enjoyed being the resident brainchild on the team. Brainiac 5's career has had its ups and downs. He invented the robot, <a href=\"../../computo/29-47321/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Computo</a>, which rebelled and caused trouble for the Legion, including cause the death of one of <a href=\"../../triplicate-girl/29-1262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triplicate Girl's</a> bodies.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"673480\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/673480-brainiac51_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 / 5.1 (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"673480\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/673480-brainiac51_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 / 5.1 (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 / 5.1 (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>The Querl Dox of Earth-247 was awarded the title of Brainiac. Before Querl, his <a href=\"../../brainiac-4/29-69693/\" rel=\"nofollow\">mother</a>, a famous scientist for Colu, held the title. She abandoned Querl on his day of birth and he inherited her research. He was speaking by the time he was an infant and functionally working as a scientist by a toddler. Querl's research conflicted with Colu's and he was sent to do research for <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>. Querl destroyed several of Brande's labs, and when Brande could no longer afford to keep him on staff, Brande sent him to work at the Time Institute on Talus. While there, he met Rond Vidar. Querl received a draft notice from Colu to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. He was so wrapped up in his work, that he ignored it. Once he was noticed as missing, he was brought into the Legion.</p><p>Joining the Legion as Brainiac 5, he was instrumental in many cases. He saved the Earth from the White Triangle, healed Triad, cured Andromeda's lead poisoning, and created the anti-gravity metal that was used in the Legion Flight Rings. He developed a crush on Andromeda, but after she was seemingly killed, he threw himself into his work. He made some new discoveries, and used them to travel back in time to save the hero, <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Valor</a>. He was arrested by the United Planets, however, because time travel was illegal. He was pardoned when R.J. Brande became President and legalized time travel. Brainy and a group of Legionnaires were exiled to the 20th Century by the <a href=\"../../emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerald Eye</a>. With his technological sources limited, the Legionnaires were trapped for several months.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"959816\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/959816-brainiac_44_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"959816\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/31566/959816-brainiac_44_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Brainiac 5 is an influential figure with leadership designs that include usurping leadership of the United Planets. Early on Brainiac 5 comes into conflict with Legion leader <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> about the way he has been leading the team. Brainiac 5 is visited by <a href=\"../../lemnos/29-1268/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lemnos</a> and is the only Legionnaire to later recall his face. Brainiac 5 broadcasts a conversation between Cosmic Boy and <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Boy</a>, causing a fight between the Legionnaires on his side and Cosmic Boy's supporters. Cosmic Boy is called back to his home planet and Brainiac 5 assumes leadership of the Legion. They reconciled later and moved forward as allies. <a href=\"../../dream-girl/29-1254/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dream Girl</a> was killed during a Terra Firma attack and Brainiac 5 recovered her body and became obsessed with finding a way to resurrect her. He captured Lemnos to try and revive her, but the experiment destroyed her physical body. It did however leave her consciousness alive in Brainiac 5's dreams.</p><p>Later, Brainy's intellect turned the tide in the battle with the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>. Brainy constructed a \"bomb\" , which was really a <a href=\"../../phantom-zone-projector/18-42369/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phantom Zone projector</a>, which <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-el</a> flew into the core of the Dominion Homeworld. He also created an anti-lead serum for Mon-El. Brainiac 5 invented a Chronexus that could view the past, and even open temporary time travel portals. With the help of <a href=\"../../evolvo-lad/29-12854/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Evolvo Lad</a>, he used the Chronexus to send <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a> back to the 21st Century. After Cosmic Boy's disappearance, he manipulated events that resulted in the arrest of <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekt Ranzz</a>, boosting <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf's</a> powers, and the recruitment of possible Legionnaire <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.R.G. 1</a>. Still, his ultimate goal was to bring Dream Girl back to life. Brainiac 5 spent more and more time sleeping to be with her. After a time, he proposed in the dream realm. After inventing a machine that could upload the Legionnaires' minds into an information-based reality and being forced to recreate their bodies, he created a body for Dream Girl as well, downloading her consciousness from his mind into the new body. He then invited the Legion to attend their wedding.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"541904\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\"><img id=\"541904\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8190/541904-fc_l3w_cv4_02_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>The event known as <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities. Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes has returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team prior to the Five Year Later. Due to the removal of the original Supergirl and the <a href=\"../../retcon/12-43566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">retcon</a> addition of the latest Kara Zor-El, Brainiac 5's past was changed. He joined the Legion as before, but without Supergirl accompanying him. Brainiac 5 would later meet the current Kara Zor-El when she was stranded weeks later in the future. He was against the idea of letting her stay. She spent an extended period of time with the team, most notably when Satan Girl attacked Earth. The two teamed up to defeat her, sparking a young romance, before Kara returned home. During this period, Brainiac 5 intentionally rigged the founding Legionnaires' time bubble to visit Superboy rather than Superman. This resulted in Superboy's historic joining of the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><p>Rejoining the Legion after the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Brainy used his knowledge to help protect the galaxy once more by organizing several secret missions among the Legionnaires to help protect time. He sent a team back to the 21st Century with lightning rods to retrieve the essence of <a>Bart Allen</a> after his death as a secret weapon for the future. He also had arranged for <a>Starman</a>, Thom Kallor, to place <a>Superboy's</a> (Kon-El) body in the Kryptonian chrysalis in the 21st Century to be resurrected in the 31st.</p><p>Later, <a>Earth Man</a> caused a wave of xenophobia to spread on Earth. Brainy sent a Time Bubble to retrieve Superman for assistance. Deported due to his heritage, Brainy took over leadership of Colu to deter the <a>United Planets</a> from going to war with Earth. Superman finally arrived in the 31st Century months later, and helped defeat Earth Man's Justice League. When <a>Superboy-Prime</a> and the <a>Legion of Super-Villains</a> went on a rampage, Brainiac Five was used his previous contingencies of Superboy and Kid Flash to help turn the tide. He also recruited the Legion of Earth-247 and Earth-Prime to help. The Legionnaires eventually defeated the villains, though Earth-Man was forced by the government to join the Legion. Brainy made a special flight ring to keep Earth-Man under control but eventually awarded him a standard one. Presently, Brainiac 5 is investigating the mysterious <a href=\"../../harmonia-li/29-71175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Harmonia Li</a>, a self proclaimed student of time travel and immortal.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></h3><h4>A insane Brainiac 5</h4><p>The computer tyrants of Colu, in the humanoid form known as <a href=\"../../pulsar-stargrave/29-52496/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pulsar Stargrave</a>, claimed to be his real father, and caused Brainy to go mad for a time. Stargrave used Brainy to frame <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a> for the murder of An Ryd, but this was cleared up when <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chameleon Boy</a> discovered that Stargrave was the true culprit. Still mad, Brainiac 5 accidentally created the vastly powerful <a href=\"../../infinite-man/29-51353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Man</a>. Then he used the <a href=\"../../miracle-machine/18-56136/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miracle Machine</a> to create the unstoppable Omega, which destroyed <a href=\"../../legion-of-super-heroes-headquarters/34-55774/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Headquarters</a>.</p><p><a href=\"../../matter-eater-lad/29-3598/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Matter-Eater Lad</a> saved the day, but it drove him crazy as well. Both Legionnaires were admitted into psychiatric care. Brainiac 5 was temporarily released to help the <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> defeat the <a href=\"../../league-of-super-assassins/65-47504/\" rel=\"nofollow\">League of Super-Assassins</a>. With the aid of <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>, she was able to purge Brainy's mind of the madness. He later went on to cure Matter-Eater Lad, as well as <a href=\"../../computo/29-27114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Danielle Foccart</a>, the sister of the second <a href=\"../../jacques-foccart/29-26646/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Invisible Kid</a>. After many years of Legion service, Brainy was forced to resign due to insubordination for his conspiracy within the Legion to kill the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a>.</p><h4>Five years later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"323259\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323259-41456-brainiac-5_super.jpg\" title=\"Brainiac 5 (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"323259\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323259-41456-brainiac-5_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Brainiac 5 (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Brainiac 5 (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>After the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Brainiac 5 was still a top scientist assisting the United Planets. When <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> defeated the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> and took his place in history, one of the biggest side-effects was that Supergirl was erased from the Legion's history and replaced with <a href=\"../../andromeda/29-6965/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laurel Gand</a>. Laurel stayed on with the Legion continuously, unlike Supergirl, and she and Brainy enjoyed a lengthy and healthy romance when they were young. However, he began to neglect her because he could not justify ignoring his responsibilities for romantic pursuits. In this new history, after the conspiracy to defeat <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and his subsequent expulsion from the Legion, he left Earth for Colu without consulting Laurel and their relationship ended.</p><h4>Zero Hour</h4><p>Brainiac 5 traveled to Winath to help try to find a cure for the <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> plague. He then rejoined the Legion when they reformed after facing <a href=\"../../roxxas/29-21133/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Roxxas</a> the Butcher. Although both he and Laurel had rejoined, he felt uncomfortable around her, because she had found love with Brainy's best friend, Rond Vidar. An incident with Glorith left Brainiac 5's body aged, causing him to have to wear a special suit to allow mobility. He later went into hiding with the team when they were framed for aiding the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khunds</a>. Brainiac 5 was wiped out of existence by the time fluctuations of <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, along with an SW6 'time clone' who had surfaced months prior among the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/49-4971/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a>.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Brainiac 5 becomes Brainiac 5.1</h4><p>After returning to the 30th Century, Brainy and others helped Andromeda investigate an anomaly in space. Once out of the anomaly, Brainy found himself changed. His personality was more friendly and there were grafts on his face that controlled his force field. <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates</a> jokingly renamed him Brainiac 5.1, a name that stuck for a short time. After an attack on Earth by the Blight, Brainy was one of ten Legionnaires who were lost in a rift in space. After a year in the \"Second Galaxy\", Brainy was able to use <a href=\"../../shikari/29-5941/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shikari's</a> pathfinding abilities to lead them home. Once home, they were soon threatened by Robotica, a collective of artificial intelligence. Brainiac 5 learned that this collective was engineered by Computo, whom he had created while in the 20th century. Computo had survived through the ages and considered itself to be Brainy's progeny. Later, Brainiac 5 and the other Legionnaires barely survived the destruction of Earth-247 during the <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a>. They were brought to New Earth by that Earth's Brainiac 5. After the Legions of Three Worlds defeated Superboy-Prime and the Legion of Super-Villains, Brainy and the other Legionnaires from Earth-247 chose to explore the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> as the \"New Wanderers\".</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intellect</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1711621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63607/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super_super.jpg\" title=\"12th Level Intelligence\"><img id=\"1711621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/63607/1711621-180px_628787_16_querl_dox_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"12th Level Intelligence\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">12th Level Intelligence</div></div></div></div><p>While the population of 20th century Earth has a 6th level intelligence, and average <a href=\"../../coluans/65-55891/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Coluans</a> have a 10th level intelligence, Brainiac 5 has a 12th level intelligence. Hence, Brainiac 5 is known as the smartest person in the universe.</p><p>He is able to create very advanced technology such as time machines (such as the Time Cube, Time Spheres and Chronexus), Flight Rings, artificial intelligences, and Force Shields. Brainy is also knowledgeable with medical technology as well, having invented the anti-lead serum for Mon-El and curing Matter-Eater Lad of his madness. Each level of intelligence represents a separate thought track, allowing him to think about or solve twelve equations simultaneously. His brain processes formulas at the speed of a computer.</p><p>While physical combat is not something he excels at, he has been known to use his body physics in combat to defend himself or incapacitate opponents. His advanced intellect presents a challenge when people try to affect him with mental abilities - he just thinks faster than they do. He has been known to learn new languages in just hours of listening to conversation.While it is not often illustrated, he excels at using technology in all forms (he is one of the Legion's best pilots), or finding weak spots in other people technology. With his powerful mind he can regulate his body's automatic nervous features with ease.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>Brainiac 5 has several other equipment items at his disposal. Brainiac's personal force field belt is nearly impenetrable when it is active. One version of his force field belt is used by <a href=\"../../booster-gold/29-1786/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Booster Gold</a>. In some iterations, like the Brainiac 5 of Earth-247, this force field is actually internalized. As a Legionnaire, he is equipped with a Legion flight ring which allows him to fly. It can also be used as a long-range communication and tracking device.</p><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Brainiac 5 possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.

Brainy and Kara were instrumental in defeating the Fatal Five and saving the day.

He brings Superman back onto the team and ultimately reveals to Kal-el his connection to the villainous Brainiac, causing a rift between the two friends. Determined to not become like his ancestor, Brainy accessed a part of his programming that was from the original Brainiac in order to increase his own knowledge. This backfired as it allowed Brainiac to slowly corrupt Brainiac 5, ultimately turning him into his host for his return. The entire Legion assembled and it was Superman who helped free Brainiac 5 from his ancestor's control. The resulting purge of Brainiac's programming converted Brainiac 5 into a human being for the first time.

He created a serum that allowed him to turn invisible, and earned a place in the Legion of Super-Heroes as one of its earliest members shortly after <a href=\"/colossal-boy/29-1271/\">Colossal Boy</a> and <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>. A dedicated member, Lyle often engaged in regular exercise and combat training to make his contributions to the Legion greater. Though he often served covertly in the background, Lyle's peers recognized his accomplishments and he was eventually elected the Legion's fourth leader in the team's fifth term.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Lyle Norg was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/26-40754/\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/jim-mooney/26-15983/\">Jim Mooney</a> . Lyle was the first election where the readers were able to vote for Legion leader and Lyle's success is largely attributed to the readership wanting to see him get more to do. Earth-247 Lyle was later revealed as gay, though this was only hinted at during his publication.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"323270\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323270-120831-invisible-kid_super.jpg\" title=\"Invisible Kid (Pre-Crisis)\"><img id=\"323270\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/323270-120831-invisible-kid_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (Pre-Crisis)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (Pre-Crisis)</div></div></div></div><p>Lyle was instrumental in helping the Legion win back Earth from its possession by <a href=\"/universo/29-22717/\">Universo</a>. Following his stint as leader, Lyle began to aid Legion cadet <a href=\"/chemical-king/29-21509/\">Chemical King</a> in the use of his powers and the two became fast friends. After several years of service, Lyle began to be haunted by a ephemeral girl named Myla. Despite her intangibility, the two got along well and Lyle became romantically interested in her.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"182516\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7368/182516-160591-invisible-kid_super.JPG\" title=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"182516\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/7368/182516-160591-invisible-kid_medium.JPG\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>The rebooted Lyle Norg was born on Earth-247 to scientist parents who often spent long periods of time away from home. As a result, young Lyle was predominantly raised by the Foccart family. A child prodigy, Lyle became interested in chemistry at an early age thanks to the Foccarts. Initially, he only created and patented things like new flavors of ice cream, but soon became more complex with his creations. His greatest invention was a serum that bent light around his body and clothing, rendering him invisible at will. EarthGov became interested in Lyle's discovery and enlisted him to do some investigative work for them. He was joined by the powerless Jacques Foccart, whom Lyle considered a brother, and the young woman who would one day become the villainous <a href=\"/charma/29-52495/\">Charma</a>. Lyle's knowledge of the Durlan language and close friendship with <a>Chameleon</a> suggests that he spent time on Durla during these days. On his last mission, Lyle was tricked into stealing his own formula. Jacques consumed it, but unlike Lyle he appeared to simply fade from existence. Disgusted, Lyle quit EarthGov and was instead drafted by Earth into the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"608517\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/608517-invisiblekid1_super.jpg\" title=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"608517\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/608517-invisiblekid1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Lyle was a child prodigy in this reality who was asked by his father and the government to create an invisibility serum. Upon learning that his father had planned to give it away for military use, Lyle decided to inject himself with the only sample so that it could never fall upon abusive hands. He lied about injecting himself, claiming instead the serum never worked. Lyle then contacted his colleague, Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes, for help in escaping from his parents who had registered him on public service. Lyle and Brainy had previously collaborated on the Legion flight rings. Brainy sponsored Lyle for Legion membership and he was accepted as Invisible Kid. At odds with his parents for running away, especially his military father, Lyle would later reconcile with the Norgs.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2156373\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/65157/2156373-lylenorg.jpg\" title=\"Invisible Kid (New Earth)\"><img id=\"2156373\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/65157/2156373-lylenorg_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Kid (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Invisible Kid (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>The events of <a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities.

Myla then appeared to the Legion, revealing herself a ghost and promising to take care of Lyle in the afterlife. He was mourned by the Legion, especially Chemical King and <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a>.

He even aided Cham in giving secret admirer gifts to <a href=\"../../lightning-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spark</a>, who mistook them as being from Invisible Kid. When half the Legion was trapped in the 20th century, Lyle remained in the 30th and was elected leader by the membership. Though he didn't want the job, Lyle proved adept at handling it. Months later, when the Legion was reunited, Lyle stepped down from leadership for private reasons and gave the job to <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a>. Lyle was later captured by his old teammate Charma, seeking revenge on him.

He developed feelings for time-lost member <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>, who didn't reciprocate and ultimately left the team. On a mission to Triton, Lyle developed feelings for a local girl named <a href=\"../../gazelle/29-50438/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Giselle</a> who had been ridiculed by her people, but was afraid to show himself to her. To investigate matters that didn't fall under the Legion's proper jurisdiction, Lyle formed the top-secret Legion Espionage Squad and served as its leader. Eventually, Giselle joined the Legion as Gazelle. Lyle, still hiding from his crush, used virtual reality to make himself appear older and buffer than he truly was. Gazelle was fond of this form, but when Lyle's ruse was uncovered she didn't seem to mind the real Lyle either.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Invisibility</h3><p>Invisible Kid developed and consumed a serum that allowed him to turn any or all parts of his body invisible at will.

While its people are able to pass through walls and other solid objects at will, she was the only member of her race with the ability to pass fully through the <a href=\"/phantom-zone/34-42370/\">Phantom Zone</a> and onto Earth, which shared dimensional space with Bgztl. After the death of her father and disagreements with her mother, Tinya was looking for an escape and found it on a newscast of the newly formed <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>. Tinya left her mother <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/29-12817/\">Winema</a> and brother <a href=\"/gyma-wazzo/29-61459/\">Gyma</a> behind and smuggled herself onto Earth with all of her savings. After doing so, Tinya impressed the Legion by showing them how easily their defenses could be breached by a phantom and imploring them to induct her. She was promptly made a member and given the codename <b>Phantom Girl</b>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Phantom Girl was created in 1961 by writer <a href=\"../../jerry-siegel/26-40754/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jerry Siegel</a> (the co-creator of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>) and artist <a href=\"../../jim-mooney/26-15983/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Mooney</a>. She was the second character to be recruited by the Legion of Super-Heroes following its three founding members, making her the third female member of the Legion and its fifth overall.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"795209\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795209-phantomgirl_70s_laroque.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl: Classic 70's costume\"><img id=\"795209\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795209-phantomgirl_70s_laroque_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl: Classic 70's costume\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl: Classic 70's costume</div></div></div></div><p>Tinya was sworn in alongside Luornu Durgo (<a href=\"../../duplicate-girl/29-1262/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Triplicate Girl</a>) and the two became friends as well as the Legion's first recruits following the three founding members. As a Legionnaire, Tinya's unique phasing abilities made her a crucial contact between Earth and the Phantom Zone. Tinya and Jo Nah (<a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>) became one of the earliest Legion couples. Tinya was so taken with Jo that she was willing to aid him even when it was thought he had betrayed the Legion. The two have since formed of the Legion's most enduring couples. Phantom Girl became a founding member of the Legion Espionage Squad and became best friends with Tasmia Mallor (<a href=\"/shadow-lass/29-1261/\">Shadow Lass</a>), and Tinya and Jo would often double-date with Tasmia and her boyfriend <a href=\"/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-el</a>. After an incident when Ultra Boy was thought dead, Tinya mourned greatly. She was later ecstatic to discover he was alive but had simply had amnesia. Tinya became the most senior Legionnaire and has served in the Legion longer than anyone else. As a founder of the Legion Espionage Squad, Tinya displayed remarkable leadership abilities (despite the odd fact that she has never actually been elected Legion leader).</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"795206\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah.jpg\" title=\"Apparition: Earth-247\"><img id=\"795206\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/795206-phantomgirl_apparition_ah_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Apparition: Earth-247\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Apparition: Earth-247</div></div></div></div><p>After the event called <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, Legion history was completely rebooted, with this reality later designated as <b>Earth-247</b>. Tinya was again one of the earliest Legion recruits, though in this continuity she took the code name <b>Apparition</b> rather than Phantom Girl. Bgztl was now an actual planet in the United Planets, rather than a dimensional neighbor, and Tinya's mother, <a href=\"/winema-wazzo/29-12817/\">Winema</a>, served as Bgztl's ambassador. Tinya lived with her mother on Earth with no family, having been born to her mother and a drifter. Tinya and Winema were both unaware her father was a Carggite and that Tinya was as well. When she was born and Winema was asleep, he stole two of the three Tinya bodies and sold them off to the Luck Lords. Ignorant of this, Tinya was raised with all the spoils of Winema's career. Apparition joined the Legion after she helped foil an assassination plot at a UP conference, the first recruit alongside Triad. While a Legionnaire, she often argued with her mother. This was especially so when Tinya started to fall in love with the unbecoming Ultra Boy of the <a href=\"/workforce/65-47189/\">Workforce</a>. The two dated in secret and professed their love to each other just as a Daxamite terrorist fried them with heat vision, killing Tinya. She was buried on Earth and mourned by the Legion, Ultra Boy, and her mother.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"539679\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/539679-phantom__girl.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl: Earth-Prime\"><img id=\"539679\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/539679-phantom__girl_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl: Earth-Prime\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl: Earth-Prime</div></div></div></div><p>Legion history was rebooted yet again, in a continuity that became known as the \"Threeboot.\" This reality was later designated as <b>Earth-Prime</b>. Tinya Wazzo again went by the Phantom Girl codename and was a member of the Legion. She was a fan of old Earth comic books and had the biggest collection among the heroes. Bgtzl was now a world that was slightly out of phase with Earth and her phasing ability was actually her transporting herself between the planets. She was able to pass back and forth these worlds at will and could often be seen in both, regardless of what she might be doing in one. This led to strange situations and misunderstandings with her teammates. A friend and teammate, <a>Karate Kid</a>, had shown interest in Tinya. But when he finally got the courage to profess his feelings to Phantom Girl, he discovered that she was already in a relationship with a boy from her own dimension who was ironically breaking up with Tinya at the time. Phantom Girl became a member of the Legion's Espionage Squad and assisted covertly on many stealth missions, and was also instrumental in entering the Phantom Zone to help rescue Mon-El. Phantom Girl and Ultra Boy never became an item in this continuity.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1623759\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover_super.jpg\" title=\"Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1623759\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1623759-phantomgirl_adventure522_cover_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Current Phantom Girl (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>The events of <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> brought together the Legions of all three continuities. Afterward, the current Legion of Super-Heroes returned to being a close approximation of the original Pre-Crisis team, once again set on New Earth. Phantom Girl's history was now unaltered from before the Five Years Later. Phantom Girl remains the longest consecutively-serving Legionnaire and is still in a close relationship with Ultra Boy. Her current costume is an updated version of her classic \"portholes\" costume from the 70's, though it is now sleeveless and more form-fitting.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Original Continuity: New Earth</h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><p>Following the cataclysmic events of the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>, Legion continuity jumped ahead five years in what is known as the \"Five Year Gap.\" Ultra Boy finally proposed to Tinya, after which she boarded a shuttle to Bgztl to shop for a wedding dress. But a mechanical error tragically caused the ship to explode, apparently killing Phantom Girl. Her death would leave Ultra Boy in mourning for years. She was once thought to have survived the explosion by being hurled backwards in time (see <b>Alternate Versions</b> below), though this turned out to be a duplicate of Tinya rather than Tinya herself. When original Legion continuity was eventually wiped out by Zero Hour, the <a href=\"/time-trapper/29-25998/\">Time Trapper</a> fetched Tinya from the moment just before her death to say one last good-bye to Ultra Boy before the timeline collapsed.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Return as a Ghost</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"917055\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/917055-phantomgirl_43.jpg\" title=\"Tinya returns as a ghost (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"917055\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/917055-phantomgirl_43_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Tinya returns as a ghost (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tinya returns as a ghost (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Though Tinya's physical body had been killed by the Daxamite assassin, her spirit ultimately survived, with her energies tethered to Ultra Boy. Only Jo and her mother could initially see her, but soon <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> detected her and clued the rest of the Legionnaires in telepathically. While stranded in the 20th century, an encounter with <a href=\"../../deadman/29-5690/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deadman</a> and a mystic entity made Apparition's spirit visible to all onlookers. Shortly thereafter, Tinya and Jo were secretly married. While in the past, Apparition encountered the heroine Phase. The pair were absorbed into their touchstones when they came near each other and learned Phase was actually one of Tinya's missing bodies, having been lost in time after being sold into slavery. Pulling together to save Ultra Boy, the girls merged for the first time and Apparition was restored to a physical form. Apparition then returned with the Legion to the 30th century and reunited with her mother.</p><h4>Pregnancy</h4><p>Tinya was on a mission in deep space when the Blight attacked, crippling space travel and forcing Tinya to spend a month in a shuttle just to return to Earth. There, she found Ultra Boy had been blighted and aided the Legion in freeing Earth. Subsequently, Ultra Boy and several other Legionnaires were lost in a spatial rift and presumed dead. The Legion disbanded and Apparition, discovering she was pregnant after Jo had \"died,\" fled to his homeworld of <a href=\"../../rimbor/34-57117/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rimbor</a> to start a new life. Her Bgztlian pregnancy lasted a year, where she came under the protection of <a href=\"../../timber-wolf/29-3619/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Timber Wolf</a> and his Wolf Pack gang. She had a healthy phase birth on the day the lost Legionnaires were revealed to be alive. Apparition resolved to rejoin the Legion with her newborn son, Cub, and Timber Wolf accompanied her to protect her. She learned that Ultra Boy had an affair with Saturn Girl during their year of being lost in space, but ultimately forgave him. The pair dealt with their son's rapid aging until Earth-247 was destroyed, leaving Apparition and her Legion the sole survivors as they were lost in the timestream. Tinya was equipped with a utility belt with rations and a transuit that allowed her to breathe in space.</p><h4>The Missing Body</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"846063\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98.jpg\" title=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"846063\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846063-phantomgirl_lsh98_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phase and Apparition reunited (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Late in Earth-247 continuity, it was revealed that Tinya's father was actually a Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), with the ability to split into three separate bodies, and Tinya had inherited this ability at birth. However, her father was also an chronic gambler who owed a fortune in gambling debts, so when Tinya was just a baby, he made a deal with the mysterious Luck Lords to sell off two of her bodies in order to pay off his debts. Her mother Winema never knew that Tinya's father was a Carggite and never knew about Tinya's other two bodies. One of Tinya's bodies was sold into slavery and her fate remained unknown. The other missing body later turned up in the 20th century in the form of Tinya's \"cousin,\" Enya Wazzo aka <a href=\"/phase/29-12983/\">Phase</a> (see Alternate Versions, below). Tinya traveled back in time to be reunited with Enya and upon meeting, they merged back into a single body and returned to the 30th century.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth Prime</h3><h4>Projectra's Betrayal</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"714266\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/714266-phantomgirl_projectra.jpg\" title=\"Attacked by Projectra (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"714266\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/714266-phantomgirl_projectra_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Attacked by Projectra (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Attacked by Projectra (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Phantom Girl developed a close bond with fellow Legionnaire <a href=\"/sensor-girl/29-6797/\">Princess Projectra</a>, who in Threeboot continuity was a selfish and troubled aristocrat. Tinya helped Projectra cope with the recent death of her parents by reading her ancient comic books from the 20th century, and politely tolerated Projectra's bratty and abusive behavior towards her. Tinya's closeness to Projectra enabled her to learn that Projectra secretly blamed the Legion for her parents' death and the loss of her family fortune. Upon further investigation, Tinya discovered that Projectra was plotting to destroy the Legion in revenge. But before Tinya could alert the Legion, Projectra found her out and savagely attacked her. Tinya initially defended herself by entering her phased state, but Projectra used her powers of illusion to trick Tinya into becoming tangible again and then beat Tinya nearly to death. Her comatose, disfigured body was discovered just in time by <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Timber Wolf</a>, who activated Tinya's alarm beacon. Tinya was brought to the Legion infirmary, where she began to recover, but Projectra then used her powers to alter Tinya's memories before she could tell the Legion what had happened. This plotline was left unresolved when Threeboot continuity was ended by Infinite Crisis.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Intangibility</h3><p>Phantom Girl has the ability to turn intangible by shifting her existence partially or fully into the extra-dimensional space known as the Phantom Zone. She has demonstrated the ability to phase with split-second timing, and is also capable of phasing certain parts of her body selectively. While phased, she is immune to physical harm, can maneuver through solid objects, and float weightlessly like a ghost under her own power. She has additionally demonstrated the ability to disrupt the workings of electronic devices by moving through them while half-phased. When fully phasing out of reality, Tinya is able to enter the Phantom Zone of her own accord.</p><h3>Hand-to-Hand Combat</h3><p>Phantom Girl has mastered a Bgztlian form of martial arts that takes full advantage of her ability to phase in and out of tangibility during combat. Her skill at striking opponents while solid and then becoming intangible when they attack has made her a formidable fighter. By partially materializing a portion of herself (usually her arm/fist) inside her opponent's body she can also deliver a severe shock to their system, though she rarely resorts to this form of attack.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super Heroes, Phantom Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>20th Century: Phase</h3><p><b>For further details</b>: <a href=\"/phase/29-12983/\">Phase</a></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"505628\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44.jpg\" title=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\"><img id=\"505628\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/505628-tinyafront44_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phase (Enya Wazzo)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phase (Enya Wazzo)</div></div></div></div><p>After Tinya Wazzo apparently died when her starship exploded (following the Five Year Gap), she seemingly reappeared in the 20th century, but with no memories of her life in the 30th century. She joined that era's team known as <a href=\"/legion/65-47223/\">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a> and adopted the codename of <b>Phase</b>. It was later revealed in Earth-247 continuity that the original Tinya was half-Carggite (Triplicate Girl's race), meaning that she could split into three separate bodies but had lost the ability because one of her bodies was missing in the timestream. Phase, also known as Enya Wazzo and originally believed to be Tinya's time-lost cousin, turned out to be that missing body. Upon learning of this, the 30th-century Tinya traveled back in time to find Enya. After finally being reunited, their two bodies merged back into one being and returned to the 30th century.</p><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"846065\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846065-phase_espionage.jpg\" title=\"Apparition (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"846065\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/846065-phase_espionage_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Apparition (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Apparition (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>After the Five Year Gap, duplicate teenaged versions of the Legion mysteriously appeared, initially known as \"Batch SW6\" since they were believed to be clones of the original team created by the <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a> prior to the death of <a href=\"../../ferro-lad/29-22592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ferro Lad</a>. Batch SW6 were later revealed to be time-paradox duplicates of the original Legion, rather than clones. They formed their own team and operated separately from the original Legion, calling themselves the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> and starring in their own series with that title. The Tinya Wazzo of SW6 initially called herself Phantom Girl and wore the original \"P\" costume. But she soon decided to differentiate herself from the original Tinya by changing her codename to <b>Apparition,</b> and adopted a black and white costume that became the prototype for the Earth-247 Apparition costume. As with her original counterpart, the SW6 Tinya was in a committed relationship with the SW6 version of Ultra Boy. The timeline of the SW6 duplicates was eventually wiped out by the <a href=\"/zero-hour/39-40782/\">Zero Hour</a> event.</p><h3>Elseworlds: Superboy's Legion</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2306628\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2306628-phantomgirl_superboys_legion.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl (Superboy's Legion)\"><img id=\"2306628\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2306628-phantomgirl_superboys_legion_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl (Superboy's Legion)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl (Superboy's Legion)</div></div></div></div><p>Phantom Girl appeared as a member of the Legion in <a href=\"/superboys-legion/49-21245/\">Superboy's Legion</a>, an <a href=\"/elseworlds/12-46699/\">Elseworlds</a> story. In this reality Tinya's mother Winema was the queen of their homeworld of Bgztl, making Tinya a princess. In appearance she closely resembled the Phantom Girl of original continuity and wore the original white costume with a stylized \"P\" on the chest. Series artist <a href=\"/alan-davis/26-2348/\">Alan Davis</a> drew her without pupils, giving her character a slightly more alien appearance.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4><b>Superman: The Animated Series</b></h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1350284\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1350284-phantomgirl_anim_apparition_super.jpg\" title=\"Phantom Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)\"><img id=\"1350284\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1350284-phantomgirl_anim_apparition_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Phantom Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phantom Girl (Superman: The Animated Series)</div></div></div></div><p>Phantom Girl had a cameo in the episode <i>New Kids in Town,</i> as one of several Legionnaires stationed in the 30th century.

She was one of the biggest cheerleaders of the team and a bit of a princess. Despite her status as a main character, she was one of the most infrequent main Legionnaires to appear and only had three speaking episodes in the second season.</p><p>In Season One, she stood against the <a href=\"/fatal-five/65-42802/\">Fatal Five</a> in <i>Man of Tomorrow</i>.

Dirk's father owned a nuclear power plant and Dirk worked as an assistant there as an adolescent. One of the scientists, <a href=\"/dr-regulus/29-31020/\">Dr. Zaxton Regulus</a>, was working on a machine when there was an accident, which resulted in the death of worker Zarl Hedricks. Dr. Zaxton was blamed for the accident and was dismissed. Angered, Dr, Zaxton blamed Dirk for the accident as he was the one who was sent to deliver supplies to him. In a rage, the doctor threw Dirk into an atomic reactor and left him to die. Dirk instead gained special powers due to his unique genetics and used them to help escape. For the adulation, Dirk took on the name Sun Boy and applied for the Legion, but was rejected in favor of <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> for that year's membership slots.

Early on he lost his powers and was sidelined, but they recovered. He became space happy on an extended mission in space where he was leader and locked up his teammates, who eventually saved him. Dirk was hit in the head during a press event and suffered amnesia just as Dr. Regulus returned to seek revenge. Dirk regained his memories in time to defeat his rival, doing so again years later when he returned after Dirk's 11 solar year (17-18 years) birthday party. His powers were instrumental in weakening the Servants of Darkness in the <a href=\"/great-darkness-saga/39-40773/\">Great Darkness Saga</a> but <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a> continuously knocked him out. During an encounter with the <a href=\"/emerald-empress/29-5946/\">Emerald Empress</a>, she broke Dirk's jaw for his back-talking. He recovered shortly thereafter. Dirk, notorious for quick relationships, had a steady one for a period of time then with <a href=\"/gigi-cusimano/29-51899/\">Gigi Cusimano</a>, an old friend of Dirk's buddy <a href=\"/colossal-boy/29-1271/\">Colossal Boy</a>. However Dirk ended that relationship as well.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556959\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556959-sunboy1_super.png\" title=\"Dirk Morgna (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"1556959\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556959-sunboy1_medium.png\" alt=\"Dirk Morgna (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dirk Morgna (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-247, Dirk Morgna once again was blamed for Dr. Regulus' firing and was left in an atomic reactor to die which gave him super-powers. However this Dirk's luminance could not be controlled, which caused him to go under scientific quarantine to protect others. Dirk became frustrated by his months in isolation and escaped to find his father, who had let him be admitted to such a place. During the confrontation with his father, the Legion arrived with a tromium-lined <a href=\"/legion-transuits/18-56566/\">transuit</a>. The suit muted Dirk's brightness and permitted him to interact with others again.</p><p>Dirk assisted the Legion on an assignment when Dr. Regulus took over one of <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/29-12846/\">Leland McCauley</a>'s factories. The battle exposed Dirk to more radiation, which cured him of his powers. Dirk then became the owner of the Magnoball team the Lodestones. He was shortly thereafter possessed by a fire elemental, turning Dirk into a fiery monster named Ph'yr of the <a href=\"/elements-of-disaster/65-52207/\">Elements of Disaster</a>. Dirk was one of the hosts to usurp control and survive, though this left Dirk with infrared vision. This led Dirk to be the first to spot the anti-energy cloud that went on to become Wildfire. Dirk, as well as the rest of Earth-247, was destroyed during <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1926924\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/1926924-sun_boy__001__01_.png\" title=\"Sun Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"1926924\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/1926924-sun_boy__001__01__thumb.png\" alt=\"Sun Boy (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sun Boy (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-Prime, Dirk Morgna was once again a member of the Legion, now a youth rights movement. Dirk's parents were some of the few adults who supported the Legion enthusiastically, much to Dirk's embarrassment. Dirk was often a field leader among the Legion and had an over-confident, assertive personality that butted heads with <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a>'s leadership constantly. He previously had a relationship with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Light Lass</a>, which was short lived. Feeling stifled by his parents and never getting the opportunity in the Legion to properly come to his own as a leader, Sun Boy resigned from the team to lead a group of meta=humans called <a href=\"/terra-firma/65-47457/\">Terra Firma</a>, who had been manipulated by the villainous <a href=\"/lemnos/29-1268/\">Lemnos</a>.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1898523\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/1898523-314151335_super.jpg\" title=\"Sun Boy (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1898523\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/67798/1898523-314151335_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Sun Boy (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sun Boy (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion to continuity before the Five Year Later, leaving Dirk once more alive and an active member of the Legion. He was kidnapped while <a href=\"/earth-man/29-32576/\">Earth-Man</a>'s <a href=\"/justice-league-of-earth/65-52497/\">Justice League</a> took over Earth and was hooked to a machine that drew his power so that the yellow sun of Earth could be turned red. He was eventually freed, but the experience left him drained physically and emotionally. Dirk sequestered himself from his teammates and initially refused to assist them when <a href=\"/superboy-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy-Prime</a> and the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/65-47190/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a> went on a rampage. Two other Legions were recruited to assist and Earth Prime's Sun Boy was killed, which this Dirk felt. His counterpart's death pained him and reignited Dirk's fighting spirit. He aided the Legion in the villains' defeat and rejoined them properly.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><b>Original Continuity: New Earth</b></span></span></span></h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556962\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556962-sunboy4_super.png\" title=\"Dirk Morgna (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1556962\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556962-sunboy4_thumb.png\" alt=\"Dirk Morgna (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Dirk Morgna (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>During the off-panel period of time known as the Five Year Later, Dirk became the leader of Legion and after a series of defections, he left the group. He was hired by Earthgov as a public relations liaison and used his popularity to get the public's opinion. When Earthgov is exposed to be under the control of <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>, Dirk is branded a traitor to Earth and his teammates. Dirk gets exposed to a fatal does of radiation when a power-sphere explodes during the destruction of the Moon and gets mercy killed by his lover, Circe. His body was later possessed to help sustain his old teammate, <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildfire</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth Prime</h3><h4>The Death of Sun Boy</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"726338\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/726338-prime_052_super.jpg\" title=\"Superboy-Prime kills Dirk\"><img id=\"726338\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/726338-prime_052_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Superboy-Prime kills Dirk\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Superboy-Prime kills Dirk</div></div></div></div><p>His time with Terra Firma proved difficult as its members refused to fully reform from their criminal ways. Ultimately, Dirk's conscience got the best of him and he personally saw to it that all his teammates were jailed. Defeated but still willing to fight the good fight, Dirk returned to the Legion and insisted they even put it to a vote to see if they wanted him back. The team voted Sun Boy back in just in time for Dirk and his Legion to team with two others to save the Legion of New Earth. During this battle, <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> froze Sun Boy with his freezing breath and then shattered him, killing him. He was later resurrected as a member of the <a href=\"../../black-lantern-corps/65-50743/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Lantern Corps</a> but died again.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Fire Control</h3><p>Dirk Morgna has the ability to tap into internalized solar power, allowing him to project luminance and heat to whatever degree he desires. He is able to project light bright enough to lead to permanent blindness and that could be seen from miles away in space. He can concoct heat within seconds that can melt through steel or be tossed as fireballs. In the postboot reality, Dirk also had infrared vision and could detect heat patterns.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Sun Boy possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556961\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556961-sunboy3_super.png\" title=\"Inferno (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"1556961\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556961-sunboy3_medium.png\" alt=\"Inferno (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Inferno (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Before the death of Dirk, members of the Dominator's Batch SW6 escaped captivity. There were shown as being time-displaced Legionnaires from the team's fifth year with Dirk among their number. The Batch SW6 duplicates survived the destruction of Earth and became the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> of <a href=\"../../new-earth/34-57126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth</a>. This Dirk took the codename Inferno. He was best friends with <a href=\"../../lightning-lad/29-1253/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Live Wire</a> and had a habit of womanizing and belittling others. He was one of the Legionnaires who drove <a href=\"../../emerald-empress/29-5946/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cera Kesh</a> to be the new Emerald Empress and he had a romance with a mermaid named Keiki. When all the other Legionnaires without adult counterparts began to vanish when the timeline was collapsing, Dirk questioned as to why he was immune with his counterpart deceased. Wildfire confronted him and revealed he had taken the elder Dirk's body. The pair then merged together with the other Legionnaires to reboot their collapsing timeline during <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><h4>Superman &amp; the Legion of Super-Heroes</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1556966\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556966-sunboy4_super.png\" title=\"Sun Boy (S&amp;LSH)\"><img id=\"1556966\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1556966-sunboy4_medium.png\" alt=\"Sun Boy (S&amp;LSH)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Sun Boy (S&LSH)</div></div></div></div><p>Dirk appeared as Sun Boy, a member of the Legion yet again, in the Legion's two season cartoon. This version was depicted with long hair and inflamed eyes. He had no lines throughout the run of the show and was often depicted as a trusted assistant to Cosmic Boy, causing him to be absent like Cosmic Boy for much of the first season. He made his first appearance as a cameo on a vidscreen during \"Timber Wolf\" and aided the Legion in protecting Earth's atmosphere in \"The Substitutes.\" He fought against the <a href=\"/sun-eater/29-47363/\">Sun Eater</a> in the two part \"Sundown.\" In the second season, Dirk was one of many Legionnaires captured on <a href=\"/takron-galtos/34-56390/\">Takron-Galtos</a> but later released in the second part of \"Man from the Edge of Tomorrow.\" He sat as jury at <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Timber Wolf'</a>s trial and ultimately hunted him down in \"Cry Wolf.\" He was depicted as one of the original Legionnaires in \"In the Beginning\" and fought against <a href=\"/brainiac/29-4684/\">Brainiac</a> in the two part \"Dark Victory.\"</p>",

Having violated the Legion code against killing, a trial was held and Star Boy was found guilty and expelled from the Legion.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759261\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759261-starboy_super.jpg\" title=\"Star Boy (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"759261\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759261-starboy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>On Earth-247, Thom Kallor was one of the few denizens of Xanthu to be born with a superpower. He was recruited quickly by the government as an adolescent to be a part of the <a href=\"/uncanny-amazers/65-47187/\">Uncanny Amazers</a> and was up for the title of Planetary Champion when the Legion of Super-Heroes was founded. Thom was not Xanthu's initial pick as draftee into the Legion, but upon <a href=\"/james-cullen/29-47877/\">Kid Quantum</a>'s death they opted for Star Boy to be their new representative. As Thom prepared to set off for Earth, a mourning <a href=\"/kid-quantum/29-1520/\">Kid Quantum II</a> rigged Thom's space cruiser so that he couldn't turn its music off. This distraction caused Thom to crash, where he spent several weeks in a body cast recovering. During that time, he was nursed with some exotic whale that sped up his recovery but also granted him Kryptonian-like powers which he discovered upon properly joining the Legion of Super-Heroes.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"170012\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"170012\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/77/170012-52844-star-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>The Star Boy of Earth Prime differed from other realities in that he was of African descent. His origin otherwise was never specified to be any different. He was still from the planet Xanthu. Thom was a member of the Legion again and a big supporter and defendant of initial leader Cosmic Boy. Dream Girl had expressed interest in him before her death, though it was never stated Thom reciprocated. He sided with Cosmic Boy when the Legion stood divided between Cos and Brainiac 5 but pulled together with the rest of his team to defeat Terra Firma. He traveled to <a href=\"/winath/34-56915/\">Winath</a> months later to search for the missing Cosmic Boy and instead found <a href=\"/lightning-lord/29-3592/\">Lightning Lord</a>, who was charged with the war crimes previously placed on Cos. Wielding the power of gravity like Thom did made him instrumental to several of the Legion's later victories, especially when guided by Brainiac 5's precise calculations. He was often paired with <a href=\"/lightning-lass/29-30997/\">Light Lass</a> for the most dynamic results.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"84466\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1480/84466-13043-starman_super.jpg\" title=\"Starman (New Earth)\"><img id=\"84466\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/1480/84466-13043-starman_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Starman (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Starman (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored an analogue of the original Legion to continuity. Following the <a href=\"/the-magic-wars/39-56080/\">Magic Wars</a>, Star Boy rejoined the team and was one of several Legionnaires who assisted <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> on a covert mission to the 21st century. While traveling through time, Star Boy became unhinged and came to reside on Earth-22, the <a href=\"/kingdom-come/39-41641/\">Kingdom Come</a> reality. He later used his powers on his costume again to travel to New Earth proper. Shortly upon arriving, Thom discovered that the ancient medicine of that era wasn't enough to keep his schizophrenia in check and he had to cope with his mental illness. This made him lucid enough that he forgot his initial mission, instead taking on the name \"Danny Blaine\" from a Xanthu pulp hero and deciding to defend <a href=\"/opal-city/34-47880/\">Opal City</a> like the <a href=\"/starman/49-5259/\">Starmen</a> before him. He even took on their codename.</p><p>Homeless, he was quickly taken in by Opal's Sunshine Sanitarium to help with his mental confusion. It was there he fell in love with sloppy joes. Shortly thereafter, his heroic efforts in Opal caught the attention of the reformed <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\">Justice Society of America</a> and Thom was recruited.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Star Boy x Dream Girl</h4><p>Upon his expulsion, Thom was met by Dream Girl and recruited into the Legion of Substitute Heroes. The pair later left the Subs and donned suits of armor to hide their identities as they joined the Legion as <a href=\"../../superman/29-1807/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy</a> and <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a>'s replacements, per their request. Following Thom's adventure as Sir Prize, the Legion elected to bring Star Boy and Dream Girl back onto the team despite their past actions. Star Boy served on the Legion for many years and continued his relationship with Dream Girl, even during a strained part of their relationship years later when Dream Girl was elected Legion leader. She eventually offered Thom the job of her deputy leader so they could spend more time together, which he only begrudgingly accepted because her term was almost over. On a mission to Xanthu and following a rough patch with Dreamy, Thom was commanded by his people's government to serve as their new planetary champion. Star Boy accepted the position and resigned from the Legion to care for his homeworld. He warded off <a href=\"../../atmos/29-28222/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atmos</a> in battle several times to keep the title, though he lost Dream Girl to the other hero.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><p>Star Boy rejoined the Legion following the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a> but only served for a short time. With the Legion falling on dark times, Thom returned to Xanthu. He fell in love with and later married Yvyya, the owner of the Naltorian Dreamers batball team. Thom retired from heroics and became their coach, though he did come out of retirement during <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>. With his timeline collapsing, Star Boy joined his past teammates in helping to rescue <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> and ultimately sacrificed himself to reboot the universe.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Star Boy in the 21st century</h4><p>As a Legionnaire, Star Boy was inducted with the draft dodging <a href=\"../../gates/29-9969/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gates</a> and was often scrutinized by <a href=\"../../colossal-boy/29-1271/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviathan</a>, who felt responsible for the death of Thom's predecessor and refused to let Thom end up like Kid Quantum. Star Boy helped assemble the Fatal Five and was one of many Legionnaires spared being trapped in the 20th century. When the Legion held open auditions for the first time, Star Boy was on the judging panel and it was there he met his future girlfriend, Dreamer. Thom was smitten with her and they began to date shortly thereafter. He returned to Xanthu several times to both cement his position in the Legion and to help ward off an invasion. He was distraught when Xanthu ceded from the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets</a> to the Allied Planets and refused a call to return home with the other Xanthian Legionnaires. One visit to Xanthu also led him to team up with <a href=\"../../jack-knight/29-23783/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jack Knight</a>, a time-lost hero named Starman. Thom then learned of his destiny to one day be the Starman of the 21st century.</p><h4>Robotica Invaded</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"891602\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01__super.png\" title=\"Star Boy vs Robotica\"><img id=\"891602\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/28018/891602-thom_kallor__03__002__01__medium.png\" alt=\"Star Boy vs Robotica\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy vs Robotica</div></div></div></div><p>Eventually, Thom's Kryptonian superpowers began to haywire. Due to his liability in the field, Star Boy was sidelined. These powers ultimately faded and Thom returned to active duty in time to be captured during the Blight Invasion. He was later freed but elected to leave the Legion when Dreamer began having nightmares. They traveled to Xanthu and worked with the <a href=\"../../khunds/65-18273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Khunds</a> to fine-tune both Dreamer and Thom's powers. Instead of just inducing mass, Star Boy learned how to decrease it as well. When Robotica invaded Xanthu, Star Boy ultimately stayed behind with former teammate <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XS</a> when the planet was evacuated. They were saved from their exile weeks later by a reformed Legion, which Thom rejoined and later Dreamer joined as well. Thom was spared from the destruction of Earth-247 because the Legion had been lost in the timestream on an adventure. He pushed into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiverse</a> with his Legion to become the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>Starman carry out R.J.

Freeing Nura, Thom was reminded of his original mission in the past. He rejoined with the other Legionnaires and they successfully used lightning rods to gather the essence of the deceased <a href=\"../../bart-allen/29-1680/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bart Allen</a>. When the other Legionnaires returned home, Thom remained in the past with the Justice Society to aid Brainiac 5 in one other contingency. Thom took a job as a grave digger and dug up the body of <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Conner Kent</a> and took it to a rejuvenation chamber in the <a href=\"../../fortress-of-solitude/34-41185/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fortress of Solitude</a> which would resurrect the hero over the span of a 1,000 years. All the while, he continued to act as Starman and assisted the JSA with threats such as <a href=\"../../gog/29-55664/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gog</a> and the new <a href=\"../../injustice-society/65-22535/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Injustice Society</a>. Gog even restored Thom's sanity for a time. Already in the 21st century, he became a de facto member of the Legion on a mission in the past to carry out <a href=\"../../rj-brande/29-12810/\" rel=\"nofollow\">R.J. Brande</a>'s Last Will and Testament, protecting the bottled cities Brainiac had stolen. With his last mission in the past finally complete, Starman was presumed to return to the future.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Gravity Control</h3><p>Star Boy possesses the ability to control the gravitational force of an object. He does so by borrowing the gravity from stars and redirecting this force onto a designated area. He can sink cities and pinpoint it to objects smaller than pebbles. He is capable of drawing enough mass to create a black hole by recreating the weight of a collapsing star. Thom wears a suit crafted together by three different Brainiac 5's that is a map of the multiverse. It is fine tuned so that Thom's mass induction ability when properly applied can create small wormholes into these realities or transport himself. It is a skill he has yet to refine.</p><h3>Kryptonian</h3><p>Previously, after crashing through a comet tail, he gained the powers of a Kryptonian as well as the ability to breathe fire. In the postboot, he also gained electrical vision. In both iterations, these abilities were only temporary.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Star Boy possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759269\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759269-starboy_super.jpg\" title=\"Star Boy (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"759269\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759269-starboy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Star Boy (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Star Boy (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Zero Hour created a blip which added a young Star Boy to the SW6, time-displaced <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> team.

Tasmia has the blue skin and pointed ears typical of her race, and as the Talokian champion she has the power to create and manipulate darkness. Tasmia has adapted to the harsh desert terrain of Talok VIII and kept very true to her people's beliefs and rituals. She and her younger cousin Grev Mallor received their powers from their ancestors, whose spirits reside in a mysterious and forbidden cave beneath the surface of the planet. When they entered the cavern their ancestors spoke to them, casting a pitch black cloud which acted on their genetic heritage and unleashed their powers. As her ancestors before her for the past thousand years, Tasmia is a hereditary shadow champion of Talok VIII. Her 20th-century ancestors Lydea Mallor (<a href=\"/darkstar/29-47236/\">Darkstar</a>) and <a href=\"/lyrissa-mallor/29-27359/\">Lyrissa Mallor</a> were shadow champions as well as members of the interstellar police force called <a href=\"../../legion/65-47223/\" rel=\"nofollow\">L.E.G.I.O.N.</a> In this extended history of ancestral champions, Tasmia trained extremely long and hard to assert her power and status among her people.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Shadow Lass was created in 1968 by writer <a href=\"/jim-shooter/26-40450/\">Jim Shooter</a> and <a href=\"/curt-swan/26-21274/\">Curt Swan</a>.

But she seized the opportunity to request the aid of the Legion of Super-Heroes and led them to her homeworld. The Legion made Tasmia a temporary Legionnaire during the ensuing battle, and together they defeated the Fatal Five. Afterward Tasmia was offered full membership into the Legion and she accepted, taking the code name of Shadow Lass. She became the first Legionnaire in history to win membership directly through battle. Tasmia's cousin Grev, who also wielded the shadow power thanks to his bloodline, went on to join the <a href=\"../../legion-academy/65-47210/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Academy</a> as <a href=\"../../shadow-lad/29-47294/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shadow Kid</a>, though he was aware that he could never join the team while Tasmia was an active member, due to a Legion rule prohibiting members with the same powers. Both cousins hoped that Grev's training at the Academy would give him the skills necessary to protect their homeworld during Tasmia's absence.</p><p>After joining the Legion, Shadow Lass became romantically involved with a teammate, the Daxamite <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El</a> (also known as Lar Gand).

Eventually they married after Mon-El was mortally wounded fighting the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> as part of a major conspiracy to avenge Superboy's death at the Trapper's hands. Mon-El recovered, but the marriage was rocky for many years despite their strong feelings for each other. Mon-El was later killed in action, and Shadow Lass went into mourning. Her grief was brought to an end after Mon-El seemingly returned from the dead. However, it turned out that he was now inhabited by the Time Trapper's essence. A cataclysmic battle then erased the Trapper from existence and completely rewrote reality, causing Shadow Lass to lose her husband yet again.</p><h3>Five Years Later: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2139576\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2139576-2139572-SL34.jpg\" title=\"Tasmia Mallor Gand (Five Yaers Later)\"><img id=\"2139576\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2139576-2139572-SL34_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Tasmia Mallor Gand (Five Yaers Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Tasmia Mallor Gand (Five Yaers Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Tasmia went on to wander the galaxy with her husband Gand.

At birth she was taken from her mother, the then-current Champion, in a bid to ensure that no single accident or attack could ever claim both of them, and saw her only seven times during her lifetime, all at solemn ceremonies in which they were forbidden to speak. As she grew up, she was raised by priests and was trained in combat and drilled in the order of her bloodline. She loved it. Finally, one day, her mother was killed in battle and she was brought before the leaders of Talok VIII's twelve tribes - the only time they would ever congregate peacefully - before entering the Shadow Cave, where she met the spirits of her mother and the other prior Champions. After they chastised her for never wondering how her mother died, she took to heart their counsel to protect Talok VIII (but not their warning against egocentrism) and they told her to Go In Power. On leaving the cave, she found the inhabitants of Talok VIII on their knees, waiting for a sign - which she provided when she let the Shadows loose. After that, she became the Champion, using her position to give orders to leaders and priests, all in maintenance of the Old Ways. This lasted until the ship came. The United Planets ship came in peace, proselytizing the benefits of U.P. membership. Sent to greet the \"invaders,\" she understood none of it , and she set about dismantling the \"hideous\" ship and crew. Despite their best efforts, she caused an explosion that caused the ship's landing gear to collapse. After that, the priests (who had already been harboring doubts about the \"zealot\") kept her drugged until UP entry negotiations were complete. Profoundly disturbed by the cultural influx and Talok's \"captitulance\", she was eventually \"dismissed\", and told to study the galaxy to \"open her mind.\"</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"526019\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/526019-1.jpg\" title=\"Shadow Lass (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"526019\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/526019-1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Shadow Lass (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Shadow Lass (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>Not much is known about Tasmia, except that she loves being in the Legion of Super-Heroes.

As part of the Legion, she fought Mordru, and later played a key part in saving <a href=\"../../wildfire/29-3621/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wildfire</a> - despite, after her initial fierce compassion, being disgusted at the thought of the forcible integration of his two original souls. Far later, the Blight enslaved most of Earth, including all but a few of the Legionnaires. Umbra was not among these escapees. When she was freed, she began to have a mental breakdown, prompted not only by the fact of her enslavement and what she'd been forced to do, but by the fact that the Blight's touching of her mind had meant that she'd <i>enjoyed</i> it. Shortly thereafter, she became one of the Legionnaires lost through a space rift and catapulted into another galaxy. There, she became harder and colder than ever in lieu of breaking down completely and showing the fear that now guided her, while the voices of her ancestors from the shadow became faint and hard to understand. Then <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> tried to telepathically calm her, and it all went wrong - a telepathic matrix over a whole planet interfered with her powers, and the result left Saturn Girl in a coma, a shadow-creature fueled by Umbra and Saturn Girl's combined pain and fear loose on the ship - and an Umbra completely without pain or anxiety, leaving only anger and arrogant self-confidence. She went down to the planet, where she began to fight <a href=\"/singularity/29-12824/\">Singularity</a> (a <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a>-like being), for whom the telepathic illusion which had caused the trouble was being maintained (to keep him from causing trouble on his race's real planet). When <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a> and <a href=\"../../monstress/29-12837/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Monstress</a> went down to get her, she began to fight them too. Finally, she was knocked out by Singularity while the Legion, having captured the shadow-creature and realized what it was, knocked out the illusion causing Singularity to go looking for his original planet. Then <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> managed to restore Umbra and Saturn Girl's minds, and Umbra finally broke down in a crying heap.</p><h4>Return Home</h4><p>After this she finally began to heal from everything that had happened to her - until, after they managed to return to UP space, her power mysteriously cut out. To find out what had happened, she finally returned to Talok VIII for the first time since her dismissal. There she found a planet completely cloaked in shadow, and a shadow which knocked her out. Shadow Maven, one of the priests who had trained her, found her and told her that after her loss in the rift, they had believed her dead and managed to empower her \"distant cousin Grev\" with the shadows through the use of technology, and had him cloak the planet completely, withdrawing from the United Planets. Angry at the thought that just as she had accepted the galaxy Talok had turned away from it, she went to confront Grev. The shadow gradually leeched back to her, until she split open the suit Grev used to control the shadow - and found a withered corpse inside, as he had been unable to withstand being a conduit for the Shadow, while the suit ran on its last programmed directives. She cast the shadow-cloak from the planet, and spent some time there before returning to the Legion.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><h4>Affair with Earth-Man</h4><p>Recently Shadow Lass appeared to have broken up with Mon-El, with no reason truly given.

When Tasmia found out that Mon-El was chosen to be a <a href=\"/green-lantern/12-41148/\">Green Lantern</a>, she felt a bit uneasy about it.

The intense darkness that she creates can engulf large areas of space almost instantly, causing an absolute absence of light which very few (like <a href=\"../../projectra/29-6797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sensor Girl</a>) can penetrate with their vision. Shadow Lass is able to control the shape of her darkness, from a large amorphous cloud to a tight beam of concentrated shadows. Those trapped within her darkness become disoriented and deprived of their senses, driving many enemies to the point of experiencing rampant fear and helplessness. Shadow Lass is completely immune to the effects of the darkness she generates and is able to see perfectly through it.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>Shadow Lass is a superb athlete and hand-to-hand combatant who learned great fighting skill from her native people as their chosen champion.

They enjoyed the Academy so much that when the Legion Constitution changed to allow married couples, they opted to stay reserves.</p><h4>Losing Another Body</h4><p>Years later, Luornu and Chuck helped form a new <a href=\"../../legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> with the retired <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a> and <a href=\"../../night-girl/29-12875/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Night Girl.</a> When Superboy from the Pocket Universe was killed by the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a>, Duo Damsel was devastated. She joined a conspiracy with other Legion members, including <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl,</a> <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a href=\"../../mon-el/29-21508/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mon-El</a>. They made a pact to break the Legion code and kill the Time Trapper. In the ensuing battle, Duo Damsel lost another duplicate and was left powerless with a single body. She continued on as an instructor at the Legion Academy but decided her fighting days were behind her after losing two of her selves, rejecting Brainiac 5's gift of a force field belt so that she could continue being a heroine.</p><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1799395\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1799395-275px_luornu_durgo_001_super.jpg\" title=\"Luornu Durgo (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"1799395\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/80137/1799395-275px_luornu_durgo_001_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Luornu Durgo (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Luornu Durgo (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>The Legion Academy had become the United Planets Military Academy after the Legion disbanded. Luornu and Chuck remained instructors with several of their former students despite the change. When the Legion reformed, they continued to assist their friends where they could but were usually busy with other duties in assisting the U.P. militia. One day, Luornu was kidnapped in the middle of the night and Chuck had to go to the Legion for help. Several other people had gone missing too - all Legionnaires who had been party to the conspiracy years ago. <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a>, who had reshaped the timeline with her as the Time Trapper, was now the villain the Legion had conspired to kill in that continuity. They had unknowingly failed, Glorith using her age-altering powers to restore herself as well as Luornu's second body, which acted as her soldier. Luornu was eventually set free thanks to her second body turning on Glorith. During this adventure, Luornu also discovered that she had force field powers - the belt Brainy had given her years ago had internalized them in her just to be safe. Safe and sound, Luornu returned home with her second body and a new super power. Still, she opted to remain with the U.P. militia.</p><h3> <b>Reboot: Earth-247</b></h3><h4>Joining the Legion</h4><p>After Brande was saved from an attempted robbery from three super-powered people, he decided to create a legion of heroes and asked Luorno to track each of those three super-powered people. After she did, she aided them in helping to clear the United Planet assembly hall during a terrorist attack. Her actions that day inspired the founding Legionnaires to invite her to be one of their first recruits as Triad. Luornu was a stalwart member, serving consistently with the team save for a period of time where she had to recover from wounds dealt by bigoted White Triangle members. When several Legionnaires were stranded in the 20th century, Triad willing became stranded with them when the two teams of Legionnaires met up later in order to bring Cosmic Boy important medical equipment to save his life. She returned with the stranded Legionnaires later and served until the team was disbanded by the government after a stargate tragedy cost half the team.</p><h4>Running R.J.

She handled the responsibility surprisingly well and helped cover for R.J. as he secretly set out to build Legion World and assemble the future of his team of heroes. When the Legionnaires thought dead resurfaced later from a lost galaxy, Triad was quick to come to their aid and reorganized the Legion of Super-Heroes with the others. Due to her great ability at multi-tasking, she often took charge of Legion World's communication hub. She continued to serve with the team until the end of Earth-247, where the Legionnaires were lost in the timestream. Following an adventure where the Legions of three different worlds came together, Triad and her fellow Legionnaires decided to venture the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Multiverse</a> as the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a> to help others without a time and home.</p><h3> <b>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</b></h3><h4>Joining the Legion</h4><p>In time, Cargg was visited by members of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Three clones, combining into one, decided to leave with them, to investigate the United Planets and the Legion as well. They took the codename Triplicate Girl. She was a member of the Legion for a year, enjoying adventures and trying new things, before she returned to her home planet. However, when Triplicate Girl reached Cargg, her other selves found her too unfamiliar. They refused to assimilate with Triplicate Girl, making her feel lost. She returned to the Legion, serving stalwartly and dating <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a> until she and Karate Kid were approached in the middle of a mission by persons unknown. They pleaded the two heroes to come with them quickly, weighing their work in their own time with the peril their visitors faced. Whatever it was, Triplicate Girl and Karate Kid agreed to go with their visitors. The storyline was never resolved before the title was canceled.Triplicate Girl showed a great deal of loyalty to the Legion's first leader, Cosmic Boy. She had gone on dates with various Legionnaires, including <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Boy</a>, Element Lad, and <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>, simply to divine information from them for Cos.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Duplication</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2524996\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2524996-duplicategirl_duplicating.jpg\" title=\"Duplicate Girl duplicating\"><img id=\"2524996\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/2524996-duplicategirl_duplicating_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Duplicate Girl duplicating\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Duplicate Girl duplicating</div></div></div></div>\n<p>As Duplicate Girl, Luornu currently has the power to split herself into an unlimited number of identical bodies. When she assimilates back together, Luornu gains the knowledge and memories that each body experienced while separated. Previous incarnations of the character (Triplicate Girl and Triad) could only split into a maximum of three bodies, while Duo Damsel could only split into two bodies due to the death of the third.</p><p>Unlike other incarnations, the reboot (Earth-247) Triad's bodies manifested three separate and distinct personalities who shared a mental and physical link. Because of her separate personalities she preferred to remain in triplicated form. At one point each body also manifested very different physical characteristics (though they still had the same facial features): One was unusually tall and strong, one was much smaller and faster, and the third was normal-sized.</p><h3>Unarmed Combat</h3><p>Luornu has mastered a specialized Carggite form of martial arts called Trijitsu, which was developed by her people to take full advantage of three forms fighting simultaneously. Now that she can create an endless number of duplicates as Duplicate Girl, Lournu can fight like a virtual army acting in concert, making her a truly formidable opponent.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Duplicate Girl possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.</p><h3>Physical Characteristics</h3><p><b>Height:</b> 5' 6\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 130 lbs</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Brown (one eye is Purple)</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Brown</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"193758\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8669/193758-61373-triplicate-girl_super.jpg\" title=\"Triad (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"193758\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8669/193758-61373-triplicate-girl_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Triad (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Triad (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>A younger version of Luornu was found with several other young Legionnaires, called Batch SW6.

She served with the team until <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>, where the elder Luornu and Triad merged together to help right the timestream and create a new future alongside their respective teammates.</p><h3>Triplicate</h3><p>\"Triplicate\" was a <a href=\"/bizarro/29-8312/\">Bizarro</a> version of the character, who could split herself into three pieces of her body.</p><h3>Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century</h3><p>Triplicate Girl appeared in several issues Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century.</p><h3>Multiple Maid/Myriad</h3><p>In a DC/Marvel crossover series, <a href=\"/myriad/29-62473/\">Multiple Maid</a> was an amalgamation of Triplicate Girl and the Marvel character <a href=\"/madrox/29-7910/\">Multiple Man</a>, who also has the power of duplication.

She was voiced by Kari Wahlgren. Unlike the comic book version, animated Triplicate Girl had hair that was three different colors -- orange, purple, and white -- and when she triplicated, each separate body had one of the three colors, with a matching costume. During the first season, she became one of Bouncing Boy's biggest cheerleaders and was overjoyed when he was elected leader.</p><p>In the second season, her white third body was 'erased' due to a temporal accident on an adventure in the 40th century. Luornu took the loss of her third body hard, even brushing aside concern from Bouncing Boy at times. Luornu changed her code name to Duo Damsel and her appearance changed to reflect her mourning. The white in her hair and costume became black. Later that season the time stream was corrected and the white third body returned, to the delight of the other two.</p>",

Jan has always been one of the most powerful members of the Legion, yet one of the most withdrawn. His mental discipline, which guarded him from accidentally killing people with a stray thought, allowed few people to get close to him. This changed when he met <a href=\"/science-police/65-23409/\">the Science Police</a> liaison to the Legion, <a href=\"/shvaughn-erin/29-6967/\">Shvaughn Erin</a>. Their relationship grew at a pivotal time in Jan's Legion career. After serving as the team's deputy leader, he was appointed to the post by <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Lightning Lad</a>, who resigned. He was angered to lose the ensuing election to <a href=\"/dream-girl/29-1254/\">Dream Girl</a>, (coming in second for the <em>fourth</em> time) but bounced back after that to win two full terms for himself. Jan and Shvaughn made a good team. They worked together to investigate suspicious things surrounding the Legionnaire <a href=\"/chameleon-girl/29-50657/\">Shrinking Violet</a> and eventually uncovered the fact that she'd been replace by a <a href=\"/durlan/29-4624/\">Durlan</a> spy.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1562498\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1562498-elementlad02.png\" title=\"Alchemist (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"1562498\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/1562498-elementlad02_medium.png\" alt=\"Alchemist (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Alchemist (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Young Jan\u2019s eagerness to help actually saves his life. Once again, Roxxas the butcher leads a band of his merry men to wipe out Trom, but this time there are a few differences. This version of Roxxas is a rabid xenophobe, who believes that his people are superior to all other races, and are perfectly justified in destroying their lives and cultures to protect their uniqueness. Another important catch: Roxxas comes from <a href=\"/daxam/34-42416/\">Daxam</a>, and he and his posse have the full powers of <a href=\"/mon-el/29-21508/\">Mon-El</a>.

Joining the team, Jan at first doesn\u2019t choose a code-name: Element Lad, but he still has the same sense of honor and the spiritual bent that we have come to know.

His power included transmutation of elements through touch, although the transmuted objects would revert back to their original chemical compositions after a minute. Jan's reasons for joining the Legion were that he saw them as a nexus of great change, something all Trommites would have appreciated. <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon</a> mentioned that Element Lad was the sole survivor of his planet, Trom, although that was never elaborated on.</p><p>Some of the Legionnaires, Element Lad included, aided Brainiac 5 in his resurrection attempt on Dream Girl, although Jan was personally against the idea. The attempt seemed to have failed when Dream Girl's body disappeared, and Element Lad unsuccessfully tried to convince Brainiac to let her go.

Element Lad's history was now unaltered from before the Five Years Later. It's revealed that New Earth's Element Lad is undercover as Smallville high's science teacher.

It is revealed that Shvaughn had been born as a male named Sean, and had taken a futuristic sex-change drug called ProFem in order to secure Element Lad's love. With ProFem no longer available in the tough economical times, Shvaughn reverts back to Sean; Jan is unfazed, saying <i>\"Look, it doesn't matter. Don't you understand ... ? Anything we ever shared physically ... it was in spite of the ProFem, not because of it ... !\"</i></p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><h4>Jan Transmuted Himself</h4><p>Element Lad continued to explore the limits of his abilities, even successfully transmuting <i>himself</i>. He discovered this somewhat by accident with the sorcerer Mordru turned him to crystal. Though his awareness was expanded, he found it more difficult to change other objects unless he first changed himself to a similar substance. The transformation made Jan's mind somewhat unstable for a while.</p><h4>Legion Lost</h4><p>Following the Blight's attack on Earth, Element Lad was one of ten Legionnaires who disappeared into a rift in space. The rift transported them into a void. He was the first to awake and transformed himself into Tromium crystal\nin order to survive. He gathered up the Legionnaires and sheathed them in Tromium as well, which had the effect of time-stasis.</p><h4>Enter Progenitor</h4><p>Recording his thoughts in memory crystals, he calculated a way to move the Outpost back to ordinary space. He was successful, but the Legion re-entered space in another galaxy, far from home. Jan himself entered the same galaxy, but billions of years in its past, while the universe was in its infancy. The Tromium made him immortal, and he drifted for billions of years, completely alone, watching stars and planets come into being. When planets began to bear life, he used his powers to accelerate their evolution. His tinkering gave rise to many races, including the Progeny and the Kwai. He eventually became known as the Progenitor and created for himself a home world called the Rosette. By this point, there was very little of the boy who was Jan Arrah. The Progenitor acted like a god, ordering the Progeny to \"delete\" any life forms which he considered \"variants.\" Eventually his timeline caught up to that of his fellow Legionnaires. They had been fighting the Progeny and finally met the aliens' master. Jan barely remembered them.</p><h4>The Death of Progenitor</h4><p>When he learned that they intended to return to their home galaxy, the Progenitor hatched a plan to follow them. He intended to remake that galaxy, too. He told the Legionnaires that he also intended to destroy all life in this Second Galaxy before he left. Of course, his former teammates could not allow either of these things. When they opposed the Progenitor, he killed <a href=\"/monstress/29-12837/\">Monstress</a>. To defeat him, the Legion managed to release the Omniphagos, a being that the Progenitor intended to use to erase all life. It took all the Progenitor's powers to subdue the creature. Meantime, the Legionnaires made it through a space warp home. They lost another one of their number, <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Live Wire</a>, who sacrificed himself to overload the Omniphagos with electricity.</p><h4>Live Wire is Element Lad</h4><p>Back home, Element Lad was memorialized on Trom with the memory crystals that remained from the Second Galaxy. In time, something miraculous happened\u2014Live Wire emerged from the crystals, his mind imprinted on the former crystalline body of Element Lad! With the help of the Brainiac 5 of Earth-0, Live Wire eventually recovered enough to change his own form back to normal.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><h4>The Death of Element Lad</h4><p>Like every active Legionnaire of his world and Earth-247, Element Lad was transported to the 31st century New Earth, to help the present Legion combat <a href=\"/superman-prime/29-40756/\">Superboy-Prime</a>, and the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-villains/65-47190/\">Legion of Super-Villains</a>. When <a href=\"/sun-boy/29-1259/\">Sun Boy</a> was murdered by Superboy-Prime on New Earth, Element Lad decided to put his qualms about violence aside to avenge his friend. He managed, notably enough, to create Kryptonite that Superboy-Prime showed to be vulnerable against (he had earlier been immune to the radioactive substance, due to Kryptonians only being affected by Kryptonite from their respective universes). In his rampage, Prime responded by launching one of the Kryptonite rocks through Element Lad's torso, killing him. A while after Prime was defeated, Brainiac 5 of New Earth explained that the reason Prime was vulnerable to Jan's Kryptonite, was that Element Lad and his Legion were from the reality of Earth-Prime themselves.</p><p>During the events of Legion of Three Worlds, the Element Lad native to the New Earth universe (supposedly the same as the original, pre-Crisis version of him) had been reported as missing. The Legion had not heard from him since the start of <a href=\"/superman-and-the-legion-of-superheroes/39-55650/\">Earth-Man's xenophobic campaign</a>.</p><h4>Black Lantern Element Lad</h4><p>Element Lad was one of many people who Superboy-Prime had killed, he travel from the future to Earth-Prime to kill Prime.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><h3>Transmute</h3><p>Element Lad have the ability to transmute substances on the atomic level. This a native ability to their home world, Trom. The Element Lad of Earth-Prime's transformations only lasted 60 seconds, and he had to be in contact with the material.</p><h3>Divine Powers</h3><p>The Element Lad of Earth-247 he had also learned how to change his own chemical make-up. As the Progenitor, he lived over billions of years, in the Second Galaxy. In this time, he learned to use his abilities to actually create (or destroy) life, making him near-omnipotent.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a member of the Legion of Super-Heroes, Element Lad possesses a <a href=\"../../legion-flight-ring/18-47353/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Flight Ring</a>. The ring gives its wearer the ability to fly, the speed and range of which is determined by the wearer's willpower. It also acts as a long-range communicator (enabling constant vocal contact with other Legionnaires, even across vast distances of space), a signal device, and a navigational compass, all powered by a micro-computer built inside the ring.The utility belt houses rations and a <a href=\"../../legion-transuits/18-56566/\" rel=\"nofollow\">transuit</a> that allows Element Lad to travel in space.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later: Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2068368\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2068368-alchemist_sw6_001.png\" title=\"Alchemist (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"2068368\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/108518/2068368-alchemist_sw6_001_medium.png\" alt=\"Alchemist (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Alchemist (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>At the same time, the Dominators' highly classified \"Batch SW6\" escapes captivity.

Saturn Girl was elected his replacement. He served with the Legion for years, dedicated and being a figurehead as a founding member and the first leader even when just another active member. During his early years with the team, a romance blossomed between he and <a href=\"/legion-of-substitute-heroes/65-47111/\">Legion of Substitute Heroes</a> member <a href=\"../../night-girl/29-12875/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Night Girl</a> and Cosmic Boy made enough money to move his family to Earth.</p><p>Years later, a firebomb went off in the neighborhood where Rokk's parents lived. His whole family was hospitalized and his mother later died. This led Cosmic Boy to almost violate the Legion code of killing when he found the bombers, but he spared them. This event also encouraged his younger brother, <a href=\"../../magnetic-kid/29-31005/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pol</a>, to join the <a href=\"../../legion-academy/65-47210/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legion Academy</a> as Magnetic Kid. When he agreed with his fellow founders that they were getting old and it was time they resigned so the Legion got new blood, Cosmic Boy was pushing for his brother to be elected to the team in his place. <a href=\"/magnetic-kid/29-31005/\">Magnetic Kid</a> became his replacement and Cosmic Boy enjoyed life as a reservist with Night Girl, traveling to the 20th century for a vacation. He would go on to found a second Legion of Substitute-Heroes with Night Girl and the Legion Academy instructors and mourned his brother when he sacrificed himself during the <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>.</p><h3>Five Years Later</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"788573\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/788573-rokk_trapper_super.jpg\" title=\"Time Trapper/Polestar (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"788573\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/27967/788573-rokk_trapper_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Time Trapper/Polestar (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Time Trapper/Polestar (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>During the Five Years Later after the Magic Wars, Cosmic Boy married Night Girl. His homeworld of Braal went to war with Imsk and he enlisted, alongside several childhood friends and former Legionnaires. At the battle of Venado Bay, Cosmic Boy was caught in an explosion that cost him his magnetic powers and left him disoriented. He stumbled into an Imsk camp thinking it was a Braalian one and would have been killed if not for <a href=\"../../shrinking-violet/29-12835/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shrinking Violet</a> stopping her troops. The disoriented Rokk, realizing now where he was, lashed out at Vi and left her scarred over one eye. He was never aware that it was Vi he had done that too until years later. Once the war was over, Cosmic Boy returned to the battered world of Braal. Lydda became pregnant and he found a chance to take his young family off-world when <a href=\"../../chameleon-boy/29-5945/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reep Daggle</a> implored him to help him re-found the Legion. The Krinns traveled to the Winath Plantation to make this happen.</p><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"198289\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/198289-74558-cosmic-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"198289\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/198289-74558-cosmic-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>A younger version of Rokk was found with several other young Legionnaires, called Batch SW6. Originally believing themselves just to be clones. It was later revealed that Val was time-paradox duplicates of his older counterpart self. The younger Cosmic Boy had the same magnetic powers and superb leadership abilities. He was named to lead the New Earth team of Legionnaires just as he had the original team. He was badly injured by a stray bolt from Live Wire, and was still recuperating, leaving vice-chairperson <a href=\"/computo/29-27114/\">Computo</a> in charge. The SW6 Cosmic Boy was one of few Legionnaires to notice when the \"crisis in time\" took hold. He, Saturn Girl and Live Wire traveled into the past to investigate their origins and wound up fighting alongside the 20th century's heroes during that \"Zero Hour.\" They returned to the 30th century believing they had stopped the menace, but soon learned that they must reemerge with their older counterparts in order to repair the time stream. In true heroic fashion, Rokk joined hands with his older counterpart, and his best friends (both versions) and bid their reality farewell.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"81254\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81254-108853-cosmic-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"81254\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/760/81254-108853-cosmic-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Rokk Krinn's magnetic skills were discovered early and he became Braal's greatest and youngest professional Magno Ball player. This enabled him to support his poor family. Rokk's fans gave him the nickname \"Cosmic Boy.\" While on a promotional tour, Rokk, along with Imra Ardeen and Garth Ranzz , prevented the assassination of interplanetary entrepreneur <a>R.J. Brande</a>. Impressed by the teens' bravery, R.J. convinced them to form the Legion of Super-Heroes. Rokk used Cosmic Boy as his codename and was unofficially the team's first leader. The government eventually tried to replace him with <a href=\"../../colossal-boy/29-1271/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leviathan</a>, but Leviathan saw Cos was the better man for the job and stepped down. He served as team leader the Legion's first year and was instrumental in revealing <a href=\"../../president-chu/29-21136/\" rel=\"nofollow\">President Chu</a> to be a traitor to the <a href=\"../../united-planets/65-56731/\" rel=\"nofollow\">United Planets</a>.

His past was unknown, though his family still existed on Braal and seemed complacent with Rokk's involvement with the Legion. As the team's first leader, Cosmic Boy often had to appease the United Planets while also spreading their movement to gather more Legionnaire fans and supporters. Several Legionnaires became loyal to Cos' hardwork while others began to be persuaded by <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a>, who thought he could do a better job. Eventually, the two sides came to blows until the leaders came to an agreement. Cos' homeworld of Braal was about to undergo quarantine and ordered all natives to return within 24 hours. Cos begrudgingly left the team, but ultimately returned at the last moment to save the day. Brainiac 5 relented leadership.</p><h3>Retroboot / New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1093600\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093600-cosmicboy_bycinar_super.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Boy (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1093600\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36139/1093600-cosmicboy_bycinar_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Boy (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Boy (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p><a href=\"../../infinite-crisis/39-40765/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Infinite Crisis</a> restored the original Legion continuity, from before the Five Years Later. Cosmic Boy had rejoined the team following the Magic Wars and during the crisis of Earth-Man's Justice League taking over Earth became the leader again. He was captured at the <a href=\"/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> with the other founders but ultimately released. At some point, Cos ended his relationship with Night Girl so that he could concentrate solely on the Legion and take care of the team so others, like the married Ranzzes, wouldn't have to worry. Cos, as leader, continued to deal with politics following Earth's bout of xenophobia and the Titanian refugees after Titan was destroyed. The pressure reminded Cos how much he disliked the politics of being Legion leader and he posted a call for a new leader election.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint / Earth 0</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2187669\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/99507/2187669-ac_18.jpg\" title=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\"><img id=\"2187669\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/9/99507/2187669-ac_18_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Cosmic Man (Earth 0)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cosmic Man (Earth 0)</div></div></div></div><p>Following the conclusion of <a href=\"../../flashpoint/39-56280/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Flashpoint</a>, the various timelines were united and rebooted once again. The Legion's timeline changed slightly where they still reached out to a young Clark Kent long before he became Superman, but they Legion grew up along with Clark and have changed their names to reflect their age. Imra changed her name to Saturn Woman and her along with Lighting Lad (Now Lightning Man) and Saturn Girl (Now Saturn Woman) reunited with an adult Clark Kent in an effort to stop the <a href=\"../../anti-superman-army/65-58873/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anti-Superman army</a> from destroying the original rocket that took Clark to Earth. They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Silver Age:</h3><h4><b>The Great Darkness Saga</b></h4><p>Cosmic Boy leads a squad of Legionnaires consisting of <a href=\"/wildfire/29-3621/\">Wildfire</a>, <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superboy</a>, <a href=\"/phantom-girl/29-1257/\">Phantom Girl</a> and the newest <a href=\"/jacques-foccart/29-26646/\">Invisible Kid</a>. Once they arrive their attacked by their shadowy foes who continues talking about the coming darkness while casually battling the assembled squad before retreating with the wand. Cosmic Boy then gathers his squad and races to London to prevent the ancient sword Excalibur from being stolen but Cosic Boy alongside Phantom Girl and Superboy are sent flying as Invisible Kid and Wildfire fail to prevent the newest shadow minion's escape with the sword. The squad then scrambles to prevent the theft of an ancient orb, but they fail but manage to capture one of \"The Masters\" shadow servants. Following several missions by three teams of Legionnaires Cosmic Boy calls to the worried Saturn Girl, but is attacked mid-call causing Saturn Girl to rush to his aid to find the captured servant to be the attacker.After a short battle however the two are defeated and only saved by Lightning Lad's arrival knocking out the monster.</p><p>Cosmic Boy alongside Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad are the Legionnaires to discover the identities of three of the shadow servants being <a href=\"/darkstar/29-47236/\">Lydea Mallor</a>, Superman and a Guardian of the Universe. Learning this prompts Cosmic Boy to send out a general alert to all Legionnaires. Cosmic Boy then takes part in the battle against the <a href=\"/daxamites/65-42480/\">Daxamites</a> under the control of <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>, being part of the team to distract him as <a href=\"/element-lad/29-1263/\">Element Lad</a> added lead into the atmosphere to activate their vulnerability. He later joins his teammates in an effort to capture the weakened Darkseid, but they fail as he flees. However following Darkseid's defeat he suffers another loss as a terrorist detonates a bomb in the city doing much damage, including to Cosmic Boy's home forcing his entire family to be hospitalized and leading to the death of his mother.</p><h4>Legionnaires 3</h4><p>Cosmic Boy was visiting the now newly retired Lightning Lad, Saturn Girl and his god son Graym. It just happened to be the weekend in which the Legion's greatest foe attacked kidnapping <a href=\"/graym-ranzz/29-52820/\">Graym</a> and delivering the challenge that only the three Legionnaires can battle him this time or he the child dies. Cosmic Boy then prepares to aid in the rescue of his godson visiting Metropolis University to request a leave of absence from coaching the Mangaball team. The three then head to Legion ally, <a href=\"/rond-vidar/29-12860/\">Rond Vidar</a> explaining the situation in confidence to gain a time machine but refuses prompting Saturn Girl to incapacitate him. Cosmic Boy then uses a distorter to assume the appearance of Rond leading them to a time cube as an officer attempts to stop them forcing Cosmic Boy to use his powers on him as he alongside his two friends activate the time cube.</p><p>The three then arrive at the the end of time, with the Time Trapper personally allowing a gap in the time barrier so the three can enter. The three then begin to battle the Trapper's minions in their efforts to kill the Legionnaires,but are captured by the surprise his minions are human bombs which releases nerve gas knocking them out and bringing them to his stronghold.Lightning Lad is then separated as Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy escape battling Trapper's minions through out the citadel and gaining his aide Otok as a guide. He leads the two to Graym as they realize that he is well taken care of that Lightning Lad has been the true target. However the hour glass runs out before the Time Trapper can break Lightning Lad's sanity, as a result he sends all of them home to a point just shortly after they left.</p><h3>Five Years Later:</h3><h4>The New Time Trapper</h4><p>Cosmic Boy was the easy choice when the team reformed to lead again. Even though he was powerless, the other Legionnaires looked to him. Cosmic Boy and the Legion helped free Earth from the Dominators and saved Earth's populace when the planet exploded. A younger counterpart of Cosmic Boy, as well as the Legion from their early years, were discovered and went on to become the <a href=\"../../legionnaires/65-56923/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legionnaires</a> of <a href=\"../../new-earth/34-57126/\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Earth</a>. <a href=\"../../brainiac-5/29-1255/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brainiac 5</a> eventually created gauntlets for Cosmic Boy that would replicate his powers; however they slowly modified his personality and drove him mad. Shrinking Violet stepped in as leader. Going by Polestar now, he left the team to single-handedly rebuild Earth. He was subdued, but then captured by <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> during the Legion's last hours before <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a>. The whole Legion, past and present, rallied to save Rokk. and he managed to escape, but was lost in a library where time past differently. For hundreds of years, he lived in this library and studied the art of time manipulation. He ended up becoming the Legion's oldest foe, the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a>. The Time Trapper freed his past self just as reality was coming to an end. Cosmic Boy merged with his SW6 counterpart, alongside the other Legion founders, as the last beings in the universe in order to reset time.</p><h3>Reboot / Earth-247:</h3><h4>Trapped In The 20th Century</h4><p>While Legionnaires like <a href=\"../../xs/29-40802/\" rel=\"nofollow\">XS</a> harbored a crush on Cosmic Boy, his eyes were set on Saturn Girl despite her fondness for Live Wire. She was his heart's desire and after an explosion left he and Imra stranded in the 20th century, the two began a romance much to the ire of Garth's sister, <a href=\"../../lightning-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Spark</a>. he enjoyed spending time with the heroes of legend he had grown up with during the team's exile. Cosmic Boy was left mentally comatose after Imra's mind was attacked by Dr. Psycho while he was linked, though he was ultimately revived by Saturn Girl's heightened powers. Unfortunately, she had just been subconsciously manipulating his body. Once she realized this, he was revived properly and in shame Imra ended their relationship and admitted she still had feelings for Garth. He hid his hurt and resolved to reunite Garth and Imra, which he did when their team returned to the 30th century.</p><h4>The New Wanderers</h4><p>Following the <a href=\"../../blight/29-51354/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blight</a> invasion of Earth and half the team being thought for dead, the Legion was disbanded. Cosmic Boy secretly served R.J. Brande as a mercenary Legionnaire while Brande prepared Legion World and the reformation of a new Legion. When the Legionnaires thought lost returned and the team reformed, Cos became defacto leader. He helped end <a href=\"../../ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ra's al Ghul</a>'s reign as secret president of the United Planets before calling for a new leader. Impressed by <a href=\"../../kid-quantum/29-1520/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kid Quantum II</a> during the Ra's battle, he nominated her as his replacement and the Legion voted her in. After the incident, the two began a flirtation that became a romance. When <a href=\"../../superboy/29-1686/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy</a> was a member of the team, Cos rode him hard because he felt Kon wasn't living up to the legacy of Superman. Eventually, Earth-247 was destroyed and Cos and his Legionnaires were spared because they were lost in the timestream. After assisting two other Legions in defeating <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a>, he and Kid Quantum led their Legion into the <a href=\"../../dc-multiverse/12-43603/\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiverse</a> to become the new <a href=\"../../wanderers/65-47418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wanderers</a>.</p><h3>Threeboot / Earth-Prime:</h3><h4>Cosmic Boy Leaves The Team</h4><p>When <a href=\"../../supergirl/29-2351/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Supergirl</a> joined the team, he was instrumental in helping her realize she wasn't dreaming and the two had a brief romance. Cosmic Boy was captured and tortured by <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominators</a>, but it was all part of a plan to trick them into going to a wrong location. Cosmic Boy's last and most controversial move as leader was ordering the dying Mon-El to take a bomb to the heart of the Dominator planet and destroy it. In actuality, the bomb was a phantom zone projector that locked the Dominators away from Earth. Cos kept this a secret from even his close friends to prevent anyone freeing them. Sending a noble hero to his \"death\" as well as exterminating an entire race was poorly received by the Legionnaires and the public alike. A public leader election for the Legion was called and Supergirl replaced him. A trio of heroes from the Knights Tempus of the 41st century then appeared to Cosmic Boy. They told him that he was regarded in history as one of the greatest heroes ever and they invited him to join their team. Cos accepted and left the Legion. He never returned, though his war crimes were eventually pinned on <a href=\"../../lightning-lord/29-3592/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lightning Lord</a>.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Magnetism</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2005970\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/2005970-cos15.jpg\" title=\"Magnetic Powers\"><img id=\"2005970\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/8/82775/2005970-cos15_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Magnetic Powers\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Magnetic Powers</div></div></div></div><p>Cosmic Boy's superpower is super-magnetism.

He used to run with a gang called the Emerald Dragons. Jo was traveling in his space-speedster when he was swallowed by an energy-beast. Fortunately, a Galactic Patrol Cruiser saw this and rescued him by slicing the creature open with a ray. Jo escaped, but his body was charged by the radiation of the monster. He discovered that he could see through anything, even lead. Later, he found that the energy could be used for many different powers, but he could only use it for one super-power at a time. He decided to use these abilities to help law enforcement, earning him the name UItra Boy and a recommendation to join the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>.

When he flew his space cruiser into a space whale, he was trapped for weeks. The only way for Jo to survive was to eat the meat of the beast, which gave Jo super-powers and allowed him to escape. Once free, Jo decided to try to become a hero. He was enlisted by an Earthman by the name of <a href=\"/leland-mccauley/29-12846/\">Leland McCauley</a> to become a member of his <a href=\"/workforce/65-47189/\">Workforce</a>, rivals to the Legion.

During a battle against the White Triangle, Apparition was incinerated in Ultra Boy's invulnerable arms. In mourning, Jo quit the Workforce and aided the Legion covertly before becoming a Legionnaire himself. Days into his Legion membership, Ultra Boy became ill and began having hallucinations.

Though her intangibility put a strain on their relationship at times, Ultra Boy still loved her and to cement this fact the two were married in a secret ceremony in the past. After merging with Phase, Apparition was restored to physicality and the Ultra lovebirds returned to the 30th century. They were separated twice thereafter, once when Apparition was off-world and Ultra Boy was possessed during the Blight Invasion and again when Ultra Boy is lost in another galaxy with a team of Legionnaires. Ultra Boy initially believed Apparition was lost with him, but he and the Legion soon learned that Tinya was merely a telepathic illusion made by <a href=\"../../saturn-girl/29-1273/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Saturn Girl</a> to keep the powerful Ultra Boy in-line.

Jo's son was also rapidly aging, though this matter was never resolved before Infinite Crisis wiped Earth-247 away. While his son didn't survive, the Legion did as they were lost in the timestream.

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2> <p>Lemnos was born at some point in the 30th century, somewhere in the <a href=\"/united-planets/65-56731/\"> United Planets</a>. A psionic handicap he had would make his brain emit a quantum frequency that changes other individuals' chemicals and electrons related to memory. Hence, he could be in a crowd and be recorded by any electronic device, and after leaving, any memory or trace of him ever being there (or even existing for that matter) would disappear just within a few minutes. He claimed to <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\"> Brainiac 5</a> the at he had to stay within his parents' line of sight so they wouldn't forget to feed him.<br /> <br /> As it is next to impossible to remain completely undetected from everything in the 30th/31st centuries, the <a href=\"/science-police/65-23409/\"> Science Police</a> found enough traces of to track him down and capture him. They were desperate to find out how he had been able to stay hidden for so long, but unluckily enough for them, had already gained control over his ability. Such control that what used to be a handicap was now what could be called a superpower. With this, could easily manipulate the memories of anyone or anything, meaning he could trick an interrogator to believe he was alone in the interrogation room, for instance.<br /> <br /> Rather than allowing himself to become some sort of lab rat for the Science Police, used his ability to spy on them, gathering as much valuable information as possible. Below their [the Science Police] noses, he was able to work behind the scenes to build his own technoempire. He figured that a man with his ability could anything without taking the responsibility or consequences for it...and hence become incredibly rich (stated by Brainiac 5 as being rumored to be the wealthiest individual in the known universe) and also shape every governmental decision to match his agenda.<br /> <br /> Lemnos has one thing in common with the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\"> Legion of Super-Heroes</a> - they both believe that the United Planets is a too slow and dull society for its own good. Which is why he supports the Legion in secret and has manipulated the outcome of numerous government decisions to help their cause. But for Lemnos, the peaceful \"rebellion\" of the Legion wasn't enough. He would take stronger actions to \"help\" the United Planets...even if it meant shocking them out of dormancy by declaring war. War was something could start by manipulating the outcast of the galaxy...the children of exiled criminals, leaved for dead by the UP. They became his army, and they were lead by some of the most powerful beings among them, called <a href=\"/terra-firma/65-47457/\"> Terra Firma</a>.</p> <p> Lemnos's plan would have worked perfectly if it had not been for <a href=\"/dream-girl/29-1254/\"> Dream Girl</a>, who, during a precognitive vision, predicted that Lemnos (although his name was not known at the time) would have a connection to upcoming wars. Brainiac 5 was able to extract the image from her mind and upload it to his computer systems, although on a search, he couldn\u2019t find any information whatsoever about him.</p> <p> Praetor Lemnos\u2019s first target in the United Planets was planet  Orando, the economic centre. Lemnos\u2019s armies were successful in destroying the planet and its inhabitants, leaving only <a href=\"/projectra/29-6797/\"> Princess Projectra</a>, who was on Earth at the time. Not long after, when Brainaic 5 was still trying to figure out who the mysterious warstarter was, Lemnos himself walked into Brainiac\u2019s lab and introduced himself, and told about his origins and agenda. Including telling him that the next target was planet Colu, Brainiac\u2019s homeworld. Brainiac refused to cooperate with him, leading Lemnos to walk out and erase Brainiac\u2019s memories about their meeting. Brainiac though, had already sent a digital message to himself saying \u201cCOLU IS NEXT\u201d, that he received a while later (leading him, <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\"> Chameleon</a>, <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\"> Saturn Girl</a> and <a href=\"/light-lass/29-30997/\"> Light Lass</a> to go to  Colu).</p> <p> On planet Colu, Lemnos had already devastated the planet \u2013 but not the same way as Orando, by military force. On Colu, he had instead forced complete amnesia upon the population, rendering the scientific centre of the United Planet useless. Even though it was too late for the Legion to save Colu, Light Lass noticed that Chameleon\u2019s antennae (which only appears when he is scanning a new lifeform) appeared for no apparent reason. She figured someone not visible was around them, and she destroyed the area by creating a massive anti-gravity field, forcing Lemnos to reveal his existence if he was to survive. escaped, but not before Brainiac 5 regained his memories and Saturn Girl seeing him (hence being able to shield every Legionnaire from memory manipulation).</p> <p> <a href=\"/elysion/29-1274/\"> Elysion</a>, one of the members of Terra Firma, was captured by the Legion after a battle on planet Helegyn. Thanks to him, Saturn Girl could find out where Lemnos\u2019s base world was, and hence the Legion set an investigation team to go there.</p> <p> After a long battle (with reinforcements from the rest of the Legion), Lemnos\u2019s armies along with Terra Firma were defeated. would have escaped if it hadn\u2019t been for Brainiac 5, who opened a portal and stunned him with a seemingly powerful weapon.

Retiring from his superhero career, he became known as The Sensei. Residing in the 31st century in the Japanese sector of a united Earth, The Sensei trained Val Armorr in all Martial Arts techniques as well as peaceful creative practices such as meditation, sculpting, and painting. Val became a master of all martial arts forms taught to him, many having their origins on different worlds. He left his Sensei in search of new forms of fighting to master. In his travels he developed his own style known as Super-Karate. When Val returned to Earth, he found that the Legion of Super-Heroes was in need of new recruits to help fight a creature of great power known as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sun-eater/29-47363/\">Sun Eater</a>. He applied for the Legion and although he had no superhuman powers, he was accepted when he challenged <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superboy/29-1686/\">Superboy</a> to single combat. His skill, strength, and speed impressed Superboy greatly.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Karate Kid was created by <a href=\"../../jim-shooter/26-40450/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jim Shooter</a> and <a href=\"../../curt-swan/26-21274/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Curt Swan</a>. DC Comics granted Columbia Pictures permission to use the \"Karate Kid\" name for the movie series starring <a href=\"/ralph-macchio/26-22931/\">Ralph Macchio</a> and Pat Morita. However, these films did not bear any significant resemblance to the comics version of the character.

He was raised in a patriotic and Jewish family. As a young man, Gim enrolled in the Science Police Training Academy to become a member of the <a href=\"/science-police/65-23409/\">Science Police</a>. While on vacation on <a href=\"/mars/34-55781/\">Mars</a> with fellow cadet and childhood friend <a href=\"/gigi-cusimano/29-51899/\">Gigi Cusimano</a>, a strange meteor crashed into the soil near him. The meteor's radiation altered his body's RNA, giving him the power to grow to giant sizes at will. For a short time he used this power to aid him as a Science Police cadet, nearly apprehending the villain who would go on to be the second <a href=\"/starfinger/29-27386/\">Starfinger</a>, but his parents encouraged him to pursue justice in other avenues. He joined the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a> as an early recruit, alongside fellow applicant <a href=\"/chameleon-boy/29-5945/\">Chameleon Boy</a>, whom Gim gave his codename as the other boy reminded him of a chameleon that Gim had as a boy for a pet. The pair were sworn in together and Gim took the name Colossal Boy, Cham and Gim remained good friends throughout their careers and Gim also later became close friends with fellow Earthling, <a href=\"../../sun-boy/29-1259/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sun Boy</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Colossal Boy was created by <a href=\"/jerry-siegel/26-40754/\">Jerry Siegel</a> and <a href=\"/jim-mooney/26-15983/\">Jim Mooney</a>.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><h3><span><span><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></span></span></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"477847\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/477847-colossal_boy1_super.png\" title=\"Colossal Boy (Pre-Crisis)\"><img id=\"477847\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/25810/477847-colossal_boy1_thumb.png\" alt=\"Colossal Boy (Pre-Crisis)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Colossal Boy (Pre-Crisis)</div></div></div></div><p>Gim's tenure with the Legion was one of the most unbroken of any Legionnaires. At one point, his mother was turned to glass and Gim was blackmailed into flubbing a mission, which earned him additional training in the <a href=\"/legion-academy/65-47210/\">Legion Academy</a> for a time until his mother was saved. Marte, Gim's mother, was eventually elected President of Earth and during her tenure she was notorious for supporting the Legion and allowing the <a href=\"/united-planets/65-56731/\">United Planets</a> to assist them where they could. Gim had a crush on fellow member <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/29-12835/\">Shrinking Violet</a> that was not reciprocated, then one day the two began to find a new-found connection and enjoyed a romance. Caught in a whirlwind relationship and delighted to have Vi finally reciprocate, the two Legionnaires soon eloped and were married.</p><p>Outside of fearing his mother's wraith for not having a traditional marriage, Gim was the happiest he could recall. Shortly thereafter though, it was revealed that Shrinking Violet had actually been replaced by a Durlan actress named <a href=\"/chameleon-girl/29-50657/\">Yera</a>. Yera had been hired to infiltrate the Legion and it was she, not Shrinking Violet, who had fallen in love with Colossal Boy. Despite the deception, Yera had been duped into the infiltration and Gim quickly accepted the fact that it was Yera he had come to love so quickly, not Shrinking Violet. She offered Gim divorce, but he refused.</p><h3>Reboot: Earth-247</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"759062\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759062-colossalboy_super.jpg\" title=\"Leviathan (Earth-247)\"><img id=\"759062\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/26454/759062-colossalboy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Leviathan (Earth-247)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Leviathan (Earth-247)</div></div></div></div><p>Gim Allon's origin during the new, rebooted universe was similar to before with one exception: he was now a denizen of Mars. He was still raised by Jewish parents and was childhood friends with Gigi. She was still present when he received his powers, this time from a meteor that crashed on Mars while Gim and Gigi were in pursuit of a criminal. Becoming a full fledged officer of the Science Police on Mars, Gim was actually reluctant unlike his previous counterpart to get pulled from S.P. duty to become Mars' official draftee into the new Legion of Super-Heroes as Leviathan. Due to his Science Police training, he was named Legion leader on his first day over founder Cosmic Boy. A \"yes man,\" Gim didn't argue even when he could sense the disdain the founding Legionnaires had for him.</p><p>On his first mission as both Legionnaire and leader, fellow draftee <a href=\"/james-cullen/29-47877/\">Kid Quantum</a> was killed by the villain Tangleweb. This caused Gim to resign as both leader and Legionnaire in shame, though <a href=\"/cosmic-boy/29-1264/\">Cosmic Boy</a> insisted he stay on the Legion, as well as hold a grudge against Tangleweb. He eventually apprehended the villain and served as Legion deputy leader for the team's first year. He had a crush on teammate <a href=\"/kinetix/29-12808/\">Kinetix</a>, much to the dismay of Shrinking Violet who in this reality had an unrequited crush on Gim. He was hard on fellow Legionnaire <a href=\"/star-boy/29-1260/\">Star Boy</a>, likely because he was <a href=\"/xanthu/34-56504/\">Xanthu</a>'s replacement for the deceased Kid Quantum who died on Gim's watch. During a battle with <a href=\"/dr-regulus/29-31020/\">Dr. Regulus</a> early in the Legion's second year, Leviathan uprooted a dangerous gas main and blasted it point blank at the villain to stop him. The ensuing radiation poisoning killed the villain, but Gim as well. He died telling Shrinking Violet that dying in the line of duty had always been his heart's desire. He was buried on Mars at a traditional Jewish service.</p><h3>Threeboot: Earth-Prime</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296685\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)\"><img id=\"296685\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296685-18314-colossal-boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Micro Lad (Earth-Prime)</div></div></div></div><p>In this reality, Gim Allon was from Earth but has different ancestry. He was born to a race of giants and had a genetic mutation which allowed him to shrink to a 6' height. This ability allowed Gim to interact with the average height Earthlings, whom he fell in love with, and where he learned of and eventually joined the Legionnaire movement. Gim took the codename Micro Lad due to his shrinking ability, though most Legionnaires called him Colossal Boy due to the fact it seemed to them that growing to his 'normal height' was actually the super power. Sometimes considered to be a little on the dim side, Colossal Boy was still a great friend and regarded highly by many Legionnaires.</p><p>He even allowed the Legion to stay at his giant-sized house for a time. He was romantically interested in Atom Girl, aka Shrinking Violet. His fondness for calling the Legionnaires \"little people\" was a cause of turmoil for his friendship with the size-conscious girl.</p><h3>Retroboot: New Earth</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1407491\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58055/1407491-colossal_boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Colossal Boy (New Earth)\"><img id=\"1407491\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58055/1407491-colossal_boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Colossal Boy (New Earth)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Colossal Boy (New Earth)</div></div></div></div><p>A close analogue to the pre-boot Legion of Super-Heroes was restored to continuity following <a href=\"/infinite-crisis/39-40765/\">Infinite Crisis</a>. All events of Gim Allon's life are the same as before the \"Five Years Later\" storyline. Gim has remained one of the Legion's longest serving members and is still married to Yera, now going by the codename Chameleon Girl and heroing herself. He was one of the few Legionnaires left on Earth during Earth Man's takeover due to his Earthling heritage and was instrumental in defeating Earth Man and saving Superman. Due to Earth Man's imprisoning of best friend Sun Boy and attacking his wife, Gim had reservations about Earth Man joining the Legion but eventually warmed up to him.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3><span><span><span><span>Original Continuity: New Earth</span></span></span></span></h3><h4>Five Years Later</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"325135\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/325135-40109-colossal-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Gim (Five Years Later)\"><img id=\"325135\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/15696/325135-40109-colossal-boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Gim (Five Years Later)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Gim (Five Years Later)</div></div></div></div><p>Gim's tenure with the Legion continued until the team was disbanded years later after <a href=\"../../the-magic-wars/39-56080/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magic Wars</a>. Afterwards, Gim rejoined the Science Police and would eventually be promoted to Chief. He stayed with the Science Police even after the Legion reformed, though assisted them when needed.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><h3>Size Manipulation</h3><p>Gim Allon has the ability to enlarge his body proportionately, effectively growing to sizes from his normal height to heights of ten or twenty five feet, for example. The precise limitations on this power have not been established, nor the exact extent to which his strength increases with size, an apparent side effect of the growth. When Gim loses consciousness, he is returned to his normal size. In the threeboot continuity, Gim was actually from a race of giants and his ability was that he could <i>shrink</i> to a 6' height rather than the other way around. Gim's baseline height was never stated, but he could now only size-shift between these two dimensions instead of having an untold upper limit.</p><h3>Equipment</h3><p>As a Legionnaire, Gim has completed personal combat training and wears the Legion flight ring to fly. The ring also serves as a communication and projection tool. With his additional combat training from his studies with the Science Police, he is one of the most skilled hand-to-hand combatants in the LSH and familiar with law protocol.</p><h2>Other Versions</h2><h3>Five Years Later / Batch SW6</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"196786\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Leviathan (Batch SW6)\"><img id=\"196786\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/196786-97234-colossal-boy_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Leviathan (Batch SW6)\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Leviathan (Batch SW6)</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly thereafter, duplicates of the Legionnaires from their early days surfaced as part of a <a href=\"../../dominators/65-56539/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dominator</a> experiment, including one of Colossal Boy. This young hero and his team went on to become the Legionnaires of New Earth, with the younger Gim taking the codename Leviathan. Leviathan had a crush on <a href=\"../../lightning-lass/29-30997/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer</a> instead of Shrinking Violet this time. When Legionnaires past and present confronted <a href=\"../../glorith/29-26385/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Glorith</a> and <a href=\"../../mordru/29-4904/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mordru</a> to save <a href=\"../../cosmic-boy/29-1264/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cosmic Boy</a>, Gim and the younger Leviathan responded to the call. During this encounter, Leviathan was aged to dust by Glorith. As a result of Leviathan's death, the elder Gim Allon faded from existence, confirming a timeline link between the Legionnaires and the adult Legion.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Television</h3><p><b>Justice League Unlimited</b></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"464999\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/24284/464999-colossal_boy_super.jpg\" title=\"Colossal Boy on JLU\"><img id=\"464999\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/24284/464999-colossal_boy_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Colossal Boy on JLU\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Colossal Boy on JLU</div></div></div></div><p>Gim appeared as Colossal Boy and as a Legionnaire in the Justice League Unlimited episode \"Far From Home.\" He had no speaking lines and was one of many Legionnaires possessed by the <a href=\"/emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\">Emerald Eye</a>.</p><p><b>Superman &amp; the Legion of Super-Heroes</b></p><p>In the Legion cartoon, he was a supporting character and often appeared in the background or with few speaking roles.

Upon consulting with her mentors back on Titan, Imra realized she was foolish and she really did love Garth more than anything in the universe. They were married and resigned by their own laws from the team. For several months, Garth and the newly minted Imra Ardeen-Ranzz were simple civilians. During an event called the Earth War, reserve members like Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were called into duty. Following the success of their efforts, the Legion voted to repeal the rule against married members and Saturn Girl and her husband reported back for active duty.</p><h4>Imra Is Pregnant</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"850971\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/850971-graym1.jpg\" title=\"Imra with her son Graym\"><img id=\"850971\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/850971-graym1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Imra with her son Graym\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Imra with her son Graym</div></div></div></div><p>Shortly thereafter, Imra discovered that she was pregnant. Since Winathians like her husband are known for their twin births, Imra was expecting twins herself. She continued to serve on the Legion during her pregnancy, participating on several missions and even going into labor during a battle against the villainous <a href=\"../../tyr/29-31022/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tyr</a>. Saturn Girl delivered a healthy baby boy on Medicus One. The boy was named <a href=\"../../graym-ranzz/29-52820/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Graym</a>, and Imra curiously noted that she thought she had heard two babies thoughts inside her at some point, but she must have been mistaken. Eventually, the Legion founders accepted that the team could stand on its own two feet and they resigned to enter civilian life. Saturn Girl had an unconventional replacement in mind: <a href=\"../../sensor-girl/29-6797/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Queen Projectra</a> disguised as the new heroine, Sensor Girl.</p><p>Soon, the villainous <a href=\"../../validus/29-21241/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Validus</a> attempted to steal Imra's son Graym. Through the adventure, Saturn Girl learned that Validus was actually Graym's twin and her child, plucked from the womb and then mutated and hurled through time by the evil <a href=\"../../darkseid/29-2349/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darkseid</a>.

She freed several Legionnaires who in turn went on to free the entire planet Earth from the hypnotic control of the villainous <a href=\"../../universo/29-22717/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Universo</a>. Saturn Girl had saved the world once again, deciding that the only reward that she wanted was the chance to rejoin the Legion. She became an active Legionnaire again while Garth stayed at home with the children. When Superboy died, she plotted a conspiracy with those that were close to him to kill the <a href=\"../../time-trapper/29-25998/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Time Trapper</a> for it.

There, they established the Ranzz plantation and a lucrative shipping and farming business to outside worlds. This continued for several years, Imra eventually becoming pregnant a second time with twins as the business boomed. Even when the Legion reformed, the pregnant Saturn Girl was able to resist and remained with her family. She and her husband assisted their old teammates when they could, even allowing the Plantation to serve as the newly reformed team's first unofficial base of operations.</p><p>Eventually, the Legion moved out and Imra gave birth to Dacey and Dorritt Ranzz. The expanded Ranzz family was short lived. The <a href=\"../../zero-hour/39-40782/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zero Hour</a> event came scant months later, wiping out Saturn Girl's reality.

As Saturn Girl, her powers were tested in confrontations with the foreign mind of the <a href=\"../../composite-man/29-21137/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Composite Man</a>, which was so overwhelming it left Imra in a catatonic state for a time. She was the only Legionnaire fully able to resist the <a href=\"../../emerald-eye-of-ekron/18-48914/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Emerald Eye of Ekron</a> and was among the Legionnaires trapped in the 20th century. There, she began to fall in love with co-founder Cosmic Boy, especially after he was mentally crippled by being linked with her during an attack by <a>Dr. Psycho</a>. This same incident freed Imra's mental blocks and gave her full access to her telepathy. With Cosmic Boy down, Saturn Girl became acting leader. Eventually, Cos awoke due to Saturn Girl subconsciously animating his mind with her increased powers, going so far as to have him propose.</p><p>Once she recognized that it was all a projection, Cos returned to his vegetative state but was properly revived. Feeling ashamed and recognizing that she loved other co-founder Live Wire, Saturn Girl ended things with Cos. Imra and Live Wire were properly reunited in the 30th century and began to date. During this time, Saturn Girl was promoted to Legion leader. Live Wire proposed to her right before the <a href=\"../../blight/29-51354/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blight</a> invasion of Earth and she accepted.</p><h4>Legion Lost</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"296755\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296755-60707-saturn-girl.jpg\" title=\"Legionnaires distrust Imra\"><img id=\"296755\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/1/13925/296755-60707-saturn-girl_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Legionnaires distrust Imra\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Legionnaires distrust Imra</div></div></div></div><p>Following the Blight invasion, Saturn Girl and several other Legionnaires were lost in a strange galaxy. On their own, Saturn Girl did her best to rally the team and went too far in her attempts. To calm the raging <a href=\"../../ultra-boy/29-1267/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultra Boy</a>, she created a telepathic illusion that his wife <a href=\"../../phantom-girl/29-1257/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Apparition</a> was with the team. When she was knocked out in battle, her subconscious projections returned and she tricked the other lost Legionnaires into thinking rescue had come. When she was properly put under for medical attention, the illusions faded. The Legionnaires felt betrayed by Saturn Girl's deceptions, even Live Wire pulling away from her. Though initially mad with Saturn Girl, Ultra Boy recognized his last few months with his wife were actually with Saturn Girl and in melancholy kissed Imra. They attempted to keep this a secret and shortly thereafter the team was in a deadly confrontation with the time-tossed <a href=\"../../element-lad/29-1263/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Element Lad</a>.

It should have been a happy day when Saturn Girl and Cosmic Boy discovered that Live Wire was actually still alive in the lost universe, however he was trapped in the body of the deranged Element Lad and the change was hard for Saturn Girl to accept. It took time, but eventually she and Live Wire properly reconciled, just in time for the whole Legion to be whisked into the timestream once again as their reality of Earth-247 was destroyed. Alongside her fellow Legionnaires, Saturn Girl assisted the two Legions of other worlds in stopping <a href=\"../../superboy-prime/29-40756/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Superboy-Prime</a> and went on to form a new group of Wanderers to aid those lost in the Multiverse like they were.</p><h3>Post-Flashpoint: Earth 0</h3><h4>Imra Search For Her Sons</h4><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1408373\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1408373-saturngirl_lightninglass_lsh04_battle.jpg\" title=\"The fight for her sons\"><img id=\"1408373\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/29754/1408373-saturngirl_lightninglass_lsh04_battle_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The fight for her sons\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The fight for her sons</div></div></div></div><p>Short time after were she paid a visit to her homeworld of Titan and her mentor Aven to help gather her private thoughts.

Imra searched for her sons whom she had brought with her, locating them only to see them spirited away in a flash of light. She commandeered a Time Bubble to travel back to the moment they vanished and try to read their minds to figure where they had gone. Her homeworld was destroyed shortly thereafter. Imra eventually found her kids, rescuing them with Lightning Lad and Lightning Lass from a zealot of Darkseid. Following the incident, she and Lightning Lad took a leave of absence from the Legion to spend time with their sons.</p><h2><b>Powers &amp; Abilities</b></h2><h3>Telepathy</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"198670\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/198670-29932-saturn-girl.jpg\" title=\"Telepathy\"><img id=\"198670\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/3664/198670-29932-saturn-girl_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Telepathy\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Telepathy</div></div></div></div><p>Saturn Girl is one of the best telepaths in the DC Universe.

Going from planet to planet to terraform them, i.e. preparing them for invasion, the Terra Firma encountered <a href=\"/lightning-lad/29-1253/\">Lightning Lad</a> and <a href=\"/saturn-girl/29-1273/\">Saturn Girl</a> of the <a href=\"/legion-of-super-heroes/65-19241/\">Legion of Super-Heroes</a>, along with <a href=\"/timber-wolf/29-3619/\">Brin Londo</a>, on Rimworld 19. After an inevitable battle, where it looked like the Legionnaires had lost, Lightning Lad used an electrical attack on Elysion and his rock pillars to surprise them and win. Defeated, Elysion along with the rest of Terra Firma, returned to their homeworld.<br /><br />Next time Terra Firma ran into the Legion, it was on planet Helegyn. Even though most Terra Firma members could escape, Elysion was tricked by <a href=\"/shadow-lass/29-1261/\">Shadow Lass</a> and <a href=\"/element-lad/29-1263/\">Element Lad</a> to go to the dark and cold side of the planet, where he easily could be taken down. Brought to the Legion Headquarters, Elysion had powerdampers placed on him, and he was interrogated by Saturn Girl to find out where their base world was. Later, he was escorted by <a href=\"/invisible-kid/29-1256/\">Invisible Kid</a> to one of the towers in the Legion HQ to be contained for the time being. However, when Lemnos awoke several sleeper agents, suicide attackers, on the Legion Plaza, one of them found his way into the tower and could free Elysion, leading Elysion to go on a destructive rampage through Metropolis. Only through the combined efforts of Invisible Kid, <a href=\"/brainiac-5/29-1255/\">Brainiac 5</a> and <a href=\"/shrinking-violet/29-12835/\">Atom Girl</a>, could he be stopped and imprisoned again. But not before the Legion Headquarters was destroyed by him and <a href=\"/dream-girl/29-1254/\">Dream Girl</a> being killed by the rubble.",

Paul left the jungles in pursuit for a modern life. At the age of 25, Paul returned to the jungles to visit his grandfather when he found the tribe's shaman killing his grandfather for a perceived slight. The shaman then cursed Paul, changing him into a creature called Taboo. </p><p>He used his abilities as Taboo to try to amass an empire, but the police were always searching for him. Paul fled from Africa and went to Andorra where he came into conflict with <a href=\"/yrial/29-1284/\">Yrial</a> and <a href=\"/lady-killer/29-1288/\">Lady Killer</a> of <a href=\"/the-strangers/65-40891/\">The Strangers</a>. After a battle, Taboo wanted revenge and sought out the help of <a href=\"/tntnt/65-50223/\">TNTNT</a> to battle the Strangers. Taboo joins TNTNT and meets defeat again.</p><a></a><h2>Powers</h2><p>Paul Ntumbo was cursed with the powers of the animals and plant-life in the jungle.

Blaze was defeated and Shazam contained the Seven within ridiculous containment shells. Little was seen of Jack Weston as Minute Man after that, however, we know he survived the War as he appeared in Fawcett City. Well into his golden years, Jack, along with Jim Barr and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spy-smasher/29-19155/\">Alan Armstrong</a>, appeared on Whiz Radio to reiterate a battle with Captain Nazi towards the end of WWII. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">Jack was still involved in governmental affairs when Jim Barr sought him out to help clear his name.

Jim was actually on a secret assignment in with the golden age <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ted-knight/29-9296/\">Starman</a> when Normandie had sunk. Jim sought out Jack, who issued the assignment, in hopes he would be released from his oath of secrecy. This would enable him to reveal details of his secret mission in order to establish his alibi. Jack was supposedly shot by Neo-Nazi, thus preventing this from happening. However, Jim was cleared of charges despite this when the true saboteur, Laslo the Poser, stepped up and told the truth.<br /></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><b><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"><br />Death&nbsp;</span><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\"></span></b></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\"><span style=\"FONT-FAMILY: Arial\">______________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Jack, along with his children and grandchildren, are killed their sleep by an unknown assassin at their home in&nbsp;Clearwater, Florida.

        "description":"<p>Quality Comics' costumed&nbsp;Manhunter debuted&nbsp;in Police Comics #8 which&nbsp;was written by Tex Blaisdell and drawn by Alex Kotzky. Dan Richards had graduated at the bottom of his Police Academy class while his friend, Jim, had graduated with top honors. When Jim refused to kill for a corrupt politician, Jim was framed for murder. Richards became the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/manhunter/29-2529/\"> Manhunter</a> to prove Jim's innocence and capture the real killer. The Manhunter solved the case and captured the real murderer based on secret files he had gathered on known criminals. Richards continued being the Manhunter whenever the authorities were unable to solve&nbsp;mysteries or capture criminals.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The Manhunter had a dog as a partner named Thor, the Thunderdog, that was always nearby when Richards walked his patrol as a policeman. Thor would join the Manhunter when he blew a supersonic whistle that was inaudible to human ears. Thor was an excellent tracker and attack dog. The Manhunter worked briefly with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/all-star-squadron/65-41753/\"> All-Star Squadron</a> then later joined the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/freedom-fighters/65-40383/\"> Freedom Fighters</a>. The Manhunter met another costumed hero of the same name, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paul-kirk-ii/29-63251/\"> Paul Kirk</a>, when both were members of the All-Star Squadron. Both Manhunters later worked together with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-all-stars/65-41754/\"> Young All-Stars</a>. The Manhunter continued his crimefighting career at least into the 1950s.&nbsp;At some point, Richards retired from being the Manhunter.<br />&nbsp;<br />Richards eventually learned about the ancient sect of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-manhunters/65-55857/\"> Manhunters</a> but not about their evil, murderous plans.&nbsp;Believing the Manhunters to be a force for good,&nbsp;Richards&nbsp;convinced his granddaughter, Marcie Cooper, to join them. During the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/millennium/39-40776/\"> Millennium</a> event, Richards learned of&nbsp;the evil nature of the Manhunters when Marcie appeared as the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/harlequin/29-24282/\"> Harlequin</a> and attacked him and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/molly-maynne-scott/29-9309/\"> Molly Mayne Scott</a>. Richards and Molly Scott escaped from the Harlequin but&nbsp;Molly was injured in the process.&nbsp;Richards took Molly to a hospital where she recovered from her injuries.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Later, the Harlequin was defeated by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jade/29-3406/\"> Jade</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/obsidian/29-9359/\"> Obsidian</a>&nbsp;assisted by Richards. The Harlequin was eventually killed in a confrontation between <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/infinity-inc/65-40384/\"> Infinity, Inc</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/injustice-unlimited/65-55733/\"> Injustice, Unlimited</a>. A few years later, Richards was murdered by Mark Shaw also known as the Manhunter and the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/privateer/29-47040/\"> Privateer</a>. Shaw was deranged, assumed the identity of a killer known as Dumas&nbsp;and was killing other Manhunters such as Richards. <br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<b>Powers/Abilities:</b> <br />&nbsp;<br />Though he had no superpowers,Manhunter was trained well as a fighter and a gymnast.He was naturally strong,tough,and agile.Criminals feared his physical abilities as well as his amazing detective skills.Criminals also feared his dog Thor.<br /><br /></p>",

Kent, who often worked with forensic scientist Jim Barr. She started out as Jim\u2019s lab assistant and later his girlfriend. It wasn\u2019t long before Susan discovered Jim\u2019s alter ego as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bulletman/29-6280/\">Bulletman</a> and wanted to share in his adventures. Jim manufactured another gravity regulator helmet for her, which enabled her to become his partner Bulletgirl. As Bulletman and Bulletgirl, the two made a formidable fighting team and were often known as the \u201cFlying Detectives\u201d. The two would go on to fight such villains as the <a href=\"/black-rat/29-77795/\">Black Rat</a>, the Black Spider, Dr. Riddle, the <a href=\"/murder-prophet/29-77801/\">Murder Prophet</a>, the <a href=\"/the-weeper/29-58945/\">Weeper</a>, and the common gang of Nazi saboteurs. The duo would eventually add Bulletboy and <a href=\"/bulletdog/29-77629/\">Bulletdog</a> (their pet) to the Bullet Family.</p><p>As Bulletgirl, Susan was a founding member of the Crime Crusader Club along with Bulletman, <a href=\"/minute-man/29-1329/\">Minute Man</a> and <a href=\"/freddy-freeman/29-10935/\">Captain Marvel Jr.</a></p><p><b>DC: Her Life and Times</b></p><p>_____________________________________________________________________</p><p>Before Crisis on Infinite Earths, Bulletman and Bulletgirl lived on Earth-S in the DC Universe along with the other Fawcett heroes. During this time, Bulletgirl was part of the <a href=\"/shazams-squadron-of-justice/65-58051/\">Squadron of Justice</a> (along with Bulletman, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spy-smasher/29-19155/\">Spy Smasher</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ibis/29-19146/\">Ibis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-scarlet/29-35564/\">Mr. Scarlet</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/pinky/29-35514/\">Pinky</a>), which would meet the <a href=\"/justice-league-of-america/65-31815/\">Justice League of America</a> (Earth-1) and the <a href=\"/justice-society-of-america/65-27589/\">Justice Society of America</a> (Earth-2) in what was called a \"Crisis on Multiple Earths\". The three teams fought <a href=\"/king-kull/29-34766/\">King Kull</a> and villains from all three Earths.</p><p>In Post-COIE, Susan Kent continued to be one of the Mystery Men of World War II along with her boyfriend Jim Barr. Susan was among a small group of heroes of the 1940s called upon by the wizard <a href=\"/shazam/29-2365/\">Shazam</a> to aid in his fight against his daughter <a href=\"/blaze/49-5281/\">Blaze</a> and the Seven Deadly Enemies of Man. Blaze was defeated and Shazam contained the Seven within ridiculous containment shells. It is yet to be mentioned if Bulletgirl was a part of the <a href=\"/all-star-squadron/65-41753/\">All Star Squadron</a> during WWII or part of another team (Crime Crusader Club) combining all former Fawcett heroes</p><p>Susan married Jim Barr and later gave birth to their daughter, Deanna. Susan\u2019s final fate is still unclear. She either died (of old age most likely) or is retired now.</p><p>She met Alix Harrower (<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bulleteer/29-41191/\">Bulleteer</a>) at a superhero convention in Bulleteer #3. She criticizes Alix for her revealing costume.</p><p><b>Skills and Abilities</b></p><p>____________________________________________________________________</p><p>Susan lacked the increased strength that Jim possessed due to her never taking the serum which he ingested. However, in her prime, she had the strength level of a woman of her size and age that engaged in intense physical exercise.</p><p><b>Equipment</b></p><p>___________________________________________________________________</p><p><b>Gravity Regulator Helmet</b></p><p>Abilities:</p><p>Flight \u2013 The helmet allows the wearer to defy gravity and directional maneuverability even at sonic speeds.</p><p>Deflection \u2013 An invisible electromagnetic field emitted from the helmet repels approaching objects (such as bullets) from striking the wearer.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>Laura Wright was born on December 4, 1920. She began her crime-fighting as the masked Blue Bulleteer using a pair of revolvers as her main weapon. In the 1960's she became the pupil of the wizard <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/azagoth/29-31039/\">Azagoth</a>. He took her to another dimension called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/limbo/34-42990/\">Limbo</a> for her magic training. She later reappeared on earth as Nightveil, with her youth regained and ready to fight crime again.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The story of Nightveil's creation is a complicated one. In the early 1970's, <a href=\"/ac/57-335/\">AC</a> Comics began using the <a href=\"/golden-age-of-comics/12-55820/\">Golden Age</a> character of&nbsp;<a href=\"/phantom-lady/29-32175/\">Phantom Lady</a>&nbsp;(aka Sandra Knight) in their titles, believing that the character was now in the <a href=\"/public-domain-characters/12-55750/\">Public Domain</a>. They starting out by reprinting her Fox Feature era issues from the 1950's, and eventually began featuring Phantom Lady in their own original stories. However, <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC</a>&nbsp;Comics had claimed ownership of the Phantom Lady, stating they had purchased the copyrights of Golden Age <a href=\"/quality-comics/57-15/\">Quality Comics</a>&nbsp;characters, including Phantom Lady, <a href=\"/human-bomb/29-4926/\">Human Bomb</a>, <a href=\"/doll-man/29-23313/\">Doll Man</a> and others.</p><p>Not wanting to engage in any lawsuits, AC rewrote their version of the Phantom Lady, changing her name to the <b>Blue Bulleteer</b> and giving her pistols as weapons. They further changed Laura Wright as the Blue Bulleteer, by having her placed in Limbo with the magical mentor Azagoth, while time passed in our world. Laura emerged from Limbo with new powers and a new identity, calling herself Nightveil, and has learned to adapt to the modern time period.</p><p>As it turns out, the copyright to <b>some</b> of Phantom Lady's earlier appearances are now in the Public Domain, while DC continues to contend that the original Golden Age version published by Quality Comics is owned by their company.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br /><h2>Powers and Paraphernalia</h2><p>Nightveil's amazing magical powers which include such abilities as teleportation, levitation, retrocognition to name a few are connected to her <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak-of-darkness/18-56510/\">Cloak of Darkness</a>, an inherently evil magical artifact. While she is arguably among the most powerful persons in her world, Laura has to constantly keep the evil influence of her Cloak in check. She is at times insecure at her own ability to do so or whether the Cloak has already corrupted her. She is often brooding and the rest of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/femforce/65-27873/\">FemForce</a> has difficulties in understanding why. She spends much of her time in solitude in her sanctum, somewhere in the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/everglades/34-56632/\">Everglades</a>. She is responsible for bringing <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderfox/29-48281/\">Thunderfox</a>, originally a fictional character, to life.</p><p>Laura seems to maintain the agility of her days as the Blue Bulleteer but now tends to avoid hand-in-hand combat. How much of her previous proficiency in it remains is uncertain.</p>",

        "description":"<u> </u><h2>Origin </h2>It all started&nbsp;in 1941, when we asked Joan (a Washington DC secretary) to be part of a research team.&nbsp;She was the assistant of Dr. Mark Benton at the Colorado Project. The objective sought by the team,&nbsp;under&nbsp;the governance of president <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/franklin-d-roosevelt/29-31595/\">  Franklin D.&nbsp;Roosevelt</a>, was to find a way to improve human abilities.&nbsp;They were asked to create the <u>perfect</u>&nbsp;soldier. The research progressed well until the moment when <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/remember-pearl-harbor/49-30283/\">  Pearl Harbor </a>was bombed by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/imperial-japanese-army/65-56574/\">  Japanese</a> military, December 7.&nbsp;The war was truly present&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Americans and Roosevelt wanted to find a way to win.<br />&nbsp;<br />Dr. Benton had created a chemical compound, the V-45. With this experimental vitamin they hoped to produce a \"fighting\" machine with accelerated cellular regeneration. Eager to have concret results, the president asked Dr. Benton to make test directly on humans. This request was out&nbsp;of his personal values and he refused to proceed. He&nbsp;was then replaced by Joan Wayne at the head of the project.&nbsp;Her assistant was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/octavia-howard/29-72502/\">  Octavia Howard</a>.<br />&nbsp;<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1317637\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1317637-barton_as_test_subject_super.jpg\" title=\"Barton as test subject\"><img id=\"1317637\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1317637-barton_as_test_subject_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Barton as test subject\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Barton as test subject</div></div></div></div>One of their first human subject was the government agent <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-commando/29-30528/\">  Dan Barton</a>, who was already involved on a mission with Senator Wright. He wore the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-commando/29-30528/\">  Black Commando</a>&nbsp;name and tried to stop some Nazi saboteurs.&nbsp; During a mission to save the life of the president, he decided to take the compound V-45 (without permission) to have superhuman strength. The expected effect was achieved, but at the same time Barton has become mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Despite several attemps, Joan Wayne could'nt make a&nbsp;compound without adverse side effects.&nbsp;Then one day she&nbsp;made the V-47, which worked perfectly on her body chemistry.&nbsp;Addition to the super strength, the V-47 allows her to restore her youth for periods of time. With this new powers,&nbsp;she left her works as a scientist. She became a super agent for the government of the United States, under the name of Miss Victory.&nbsp;<br /><br />Its only two years later she gathered a team of&nbsp;super woman, called <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/femforce/65-27873/\">  FemForce</a>. The original members, with her as Miss Victory (and leader), was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightveil/29-1338/\">  Blue Bulleteer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-cat/29-6649/\">  She-Cat</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rio-rita/29-27275/\">  Rio Rita</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br /><u> </u><h2>Rad </h2>Without meaning to, just thinking about him, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nightveil/29-1338/\">  Nightveil </a>freed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-commando/29-30528/\">  Black Commando</a> from his&nbsp;restraints 40 years later.

Under this, Joan Wayne became <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rad/29-6648/\">  Rad</a>.&nbsp;She has the same power but a very unpleasant personality and intentions unhealthy. For exemple, she likes to see She-Cat suffer instead of helping, as before. Her first goal, in this state, was&nbsp;to disband the&nbsp;FemForce team.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Somehow, Nightveil is then indirectly responsible for the arrival of Rad.&nbsp;<br /><br />Not wanting anymore of her leader role, and as the Government considered it a mental aberration, Joan \"Rad\" has been replaced by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/colt/29-30533/\">  Colt</a>, a former agent. The FF headquarters has also been moved on <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jungle-island/34-56957/\">  Jungle Island</a>, a wild life reserve&nbsp;controlled by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tara/29-6654/\">  Tara Fremont</a>, near <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/florida/34-55740/\">  Florida</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Given the great loyalty shown by&nbsp;Joan Wayne over the years, the Government takes times to allow her regain her senses. If that&nbsp;moment never comes, they plan to create a new Miss Victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the team, they have not yet decided what they would do.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><u> </u><h2>Rad, still Rad </h2>Several weeks passed and Miss Victory is always Rad. Her attitude is increasingly negative, she cares only for her little person. She is often the cause of various problems that often leads to physical confrontations (including a brawl in a nightclub). She always wins out however, with her superhuman strength. She is often really too strong for everyone in fact.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Colt, the new leader of the team's, wants to recovers the real Joan. Despite her efforts, it did not work. Then Colt and Rad were then involved in few events in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/orlando-florida/34-56225/\">  Orlando </a>caused by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dr-pretorius/29-72422/\">  Dr. Pretorius</a>. This man wants eliminate Rad and he's ready to do anything to that. After the altercation, the Doctor's plan did not work. But Rad has not been able to save the life of a child due to negligence on her part. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />When government members were informed of events, they have judged Rad inapt and dangerous. Rad/Joan possesses state secrets of the highest importance and they do not want them falling into the wrong hands. After the testimony of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tom-kelly/29-72465/\">  Captain Kelly </a>on the issue, they took a decision: Rad must be put under arrest. If necessary, they are ready to kill her. &nbsp;Captain Kelly does not share this view but this does not make a difference. Kelly made an anonymous call to the leader of FemForce, Colt, to tell her about the intentions of the State. Colt believes this anonymous man and organizes an outing to recover Rad.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />While all this happening in her back, Rad has found the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/octavia-howard/29-72502/\">  Octavia Howard </a>formula, who helps rejuvenate. She targets some elderly rich and socially known and sells this product at high prices. This is an immediate success, Rad has more and more customers and hopes to become very rich.<br />&nbsp;<br /><u> </u><h2>Many attackers, one target</h2>The strike force of the current members of FemForce is perhaps not sufficient to confront Rad. Rad is physically stronger than any member, even <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderfox/29-48281/\">  Thunderfox</a>. Stardust therefore call for reinforcements:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-paragon/29-6660/\">  Paragon,&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-scorpion/29-25991/\">  Scarlet Scorpion</a>, D-Man and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/astron/29-30551/\">  Astron</a>. Three teams went searching through the city. Several battles were fought against Rad. Though weakened, she still has the upper hand. But Paragon was finally able to knock her out with the help of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-cat/29-6649/\">  She-Cat</a>.&nbsp;Rad is then securely attached while they wait than the effect of her vitamin disappears.<br />&nbsp;<br /> <div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1324445\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1324445-rad_confined_super.jpg\" title=\"Temporarily confined \"><img id=\"1324445\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/68167/1324445-rad_confined_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Temporarily confined \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Temporarily confined </div></div></div></div>Two days later Rad reverts to her true form,&nbsp;old, without power. But her personality is Rad or Joan? FemForce takes the risk of giving her the right vitamin, the V-47, hoping the return of Ms. Victory. Another failure...&nbsp;&nbsp;Rad regains her power to tear away her steel containment's and escapes, smashing through a brick wall, taking care to stun everyone in the passage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />A few days later, Miss Victory arrived at HQ FemForce, a bottle of champagne in hand. Members of FF are wild with joy, they find the real Joan yet. Probably than the V-45 has finally made its effect, with some delay. So they drink to celebrate this long-awaited return. Trickery. Rad was only \"disguised\" as Ms. Victory and her champagne was in fact the product of rejuvenation. Each member of the team rejuvenate and become teenagers. Rad left by breaking another brick wall.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The FemForce <u>teenage</u> heroines want their revenge and are always looking for a way to put Rad out of the circulation. But <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tc-fremont/29-72420/\">  T.C. Fremont </a>prohibits them from doing anything whatsoever in their condition. They are confined to the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/femforce-headquarter/34-56961/\">  HQ</a>. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />For Rad, this was not the end of&nbsp;clashes.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/general-robert-gordon/29-72564/\">  General Robert Gordon</a>, the new FemForce head (at Pentagon)&nbsp;clandestinely hires a group of super-mercenaries to bring her down once and for all, in exchange for a lot of money. Among the villains, there was <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/rip-jaw/29-46155/\">  Rip-Jaw</a>, Valkoray, Lonestar, Kallima, Shred and Frosbite.&nbsp;After several more battles, Rad is weakened but strong enough to come out on top again. Is anyone going to stop her?&nbsp;Who? When?<br />&nbsp;<br /> <h2>Wonder Woman comparison </h2>Miss Victory has often been compared to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-woman/29-2048/\">  Wonder Woman</a>. The two have already been secretary at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/washington-dc/34-55685/\">  Washington DC</a>, military, they wear a outfit in the colors of their country and have similar powers.&nbsp;One may ask, who's first appeared? Well, it's Ms. Victory in August 1941. Wonder Woman was created in January 1942.&nbsp;",

As Levin develops the character he portrays the human subconscious of Nancy as what truly creates the alter-ego which surfaces as Dragonfly. Tied deeply into what Nancy wishes herself to become.&nbsp; She was referred by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-scorpion/29-25991/\">Scarlet Scorpion</a> after the two fought together, however the concept of Dragonfly being a loner, she doesn't feel comfortable if groups. She was portrayed as being nervous when she joined the more experienced FemForce members in their all female group. She is later depicted has having emotional conflict with remaining in her Dragonfly form, realizing she enjoyed remaining in the powerful body. Also she has recently been written to portray a narcissistic and materialistic demeanor, leaving her human persona of Nancy to not resurface.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; <br /><br />\n<h2>History</h2>&nbsp; \n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1581907\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23334/1581907-dragonfly_male_super.jpg\" title=\"John Howard Gallegher, the original Dragonfly\"><img id=\"1581907\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/2/23334/1581907-dragonfly_male_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"John Howard Gallegher, the original Dragonfly\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">John Howard Gallegher, the original Dragonfly</div></div></div></div>During the 1940's, a dedicated student of the occult John Howard Gallegher performed a mystic ritual to open a dimensional gateway allowing an insect deity named Zzarra which gave him super human powers. He would have a brief stint as a costumed post wartime masked man going by the name Dragonfly, battling a few villains before he mysteriously disappeared. As time goes on a young Engineer Kenneth Francis Burton Jr. spends years learning all he can about the mysterious Gallegher, who had died in 1957.&nbsp; Burton would eventually learn the secrets of the incantations which Gallegher had discovered&nbsp; in hopes of gaining the same magical super powers.&nbsp; However, while he is performing the ceremony at his factory, his fiancee Nancy Arazello also an engineer, suddenly walks into the lab at his warehouse just as the bolt of transformative magics are blasted by Zzarra and receives the full force of the unleashed supernatural powers.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;<br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1695222\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1695222-dragonfly_picture_15_super.jpg\" title=\"Kenneth examines Nancy's transformation \"><img id=\"1695222\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1695222-dragonfly_picture_15_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Kenneth examines Nancy's transformation \" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Kenneth examines Nancy's transformation </div></div></div></div>As both Ken and Nancy, now in an altered meta-human state, try to make better scene of the situation. Ken begins to explain to Nancy that he had for sometime been investigating the stories behind the original Dragonfly, learning that he gained his abilities though the ancient rituals of the insect deity Zzarra, in hopes of gaining the same powers. However since Nancy had walked into the spell blast and received its magical properties instead, she had now become the new Dragonfly. Ken next runs tests on her new body's properties discovering she obtained super-strength, near invulnerability due to a telekinetic ability, and can fly at amazing speeds. Nancy next goes to visit her sister and letting her in on her new transformation, discussing Ken's treatments and experiments. This however does not sit well with her sister as she tells Nancy that its strange behavior from her paramour. Excusing his actions by rationalizing his behavior and the reasons why he ran the tests on her, Nancy flies off to check back up with Ken at his warehouse.<br />&nbsp;<br />While returning to the warehouse and testing out her powers in the cityscape she flies into a psycho called Skyjack who is being paid to use a helicopter to blast a local skyscraper from being constructed. He shoots off his missiles at the building while construction crews are working on the skyscraper. Dragonfly realizes she can use her telekinesis to hold the skyscraper up until she can rescue all the workers, but the helicopter pilot sees her and shoots her in the back with a barrage of machine-gun fire. Hit and hurt by the bullets and unable to keep aloft or continue lifting the building telekinetically due to her wounds, she falls and lets go of her mental hold on the falling structure and the workers. When Skyjack lands his helicopter and dismounts to finish the job and shoot Dragonfly her telekinetic abilities kick in again, coating her in a protective field and the bullets bounce harmlessly off. Managing to escape, Nancy realizes the limits to her new body and its abilities. <br />&nbsp;<br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1687985\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/1687985-23574_3551_26283_1_dragonfly_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The scorpion, the dragon\"><img id=\"1687985\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/1687985-23574_3551_26283_1_dragonfly_super_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"The scorpion, the dragon\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The scorpion, the dragon</div></div></div></div>Not too long after this encounter Nancy decides to stay in her Dragonfly body and goes with her sister on a shopping spree, hoping to distress and enjoy her new shapely attributes of this body. Talking to her sister further about how she is enjoying the feeling of this powerful new form, and her fears of being hurt after being shot during the previous outing. They walk into an army of giant insects marching downtown and causing destruction of property and endangering people. For an instant Nancy pulls back from the situation until someone is killed and she jumps fully into the battle with the bugs. Being hurt by one of the giant insects she gains assistance from another costumed hero named the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/scarlet-scorpion/29-25991/\">Scarlett Scorpion</a> who also happenstances into the scenario. The two defeat the mutated insects and exchange a bit of dialogue, including the Scorpion asking her out.<br />&nbsp;<br />Soon after in her alter-ego as Dragonfly she encounters the man sized insect man going by the name&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mantis-man/29-76399/\">Mantis Man</a>, who is really biologist Dr. Manning. As Mantis Man, Manning has strength rivaling Dragonfly's superhuman new body, taking vicious blows at her she escapes before he captures her. Mantis Man has a previous encounter earlier on in the career with her predecessor Gallegher, the first Dragonfly, becoming the hateful arch enemy of his. Not surfacing for many years Gallegher was assumed dead, hence the need for the new female version, Nancy becoming the new Dragonfly. Mantis Man than lures Dragonfly into a trap, and attacks her believing her to be his long lost enemy. She is not the same of course, but he beats her up anyway. After being beaten nearly to a pulp, she decides to change to her alter ego, thus causing the customary explosion to occur which startles Mantis Man into releasing her. She immediately tries to change back to Dragonfly but somehow cannot when suddenly another Dragonfly appears, looking like her long lost predecessor.&nbsp; However he is not the real Dragonfly but another vigilante named <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/masquerader/29-31040/\">Masquerader </a>in disguise. Utilizing a smoke bomb he blinds Mantis Man he rescues Nancy and takes her away to a safe place. Recovering from the intense beating at the villains claws she transforms back into her&nbsp; Dragonfly body again, returning to defeat Mantis Man once and for all. <br />&nbsp;<br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1695206\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/1695206-dragonfly8p06_17197_super.jpg\" title=\"Awaken to the unknown\"><img id=\"1695206\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/8842/1695206-dragonfly8p06_17197_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Awaken to the unknown\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Awaken to the unknown</div></div></div></div>Betrayed, she was than murdered while in her human identity as Nancy Arazello, she awakens into an apparent \"limbo\" of sorts, a plane in between living and not living.

Entering one of these portals she discovers that she no longer retains her superhuman abilities, now simply a normal human being still in her Dragonfly costume. Trying to gain her bearings in this different dimensional plane a group of reptilian looking barbarians than appear and find Nancy alone in a ruined city and accost her, Rough housing her and unable to defend herself without her powers, she is abducted and her life is threatened.

Reverting back to Nancy would lead her to lose these new traits while in a human form.&nbsp; First of all she is able to fly, the speeds and altitudes that she is able to reach have not been tested or studied to any extent. Her transformed physical form is also incredibly stronger, now possessing super strength and can comfortably lift and press several tons of weight. Lastly she and is seemingly nearly invulnerable thanks to a change in her brain structure, causing heightened telekinetic abilities that somehow automatically forms a force field around her body. <br />\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1695209\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1695209-dragonfly_picture_03_super.jpg\" title=\"On wings of gossamer\"><img id=\"1695209\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/55351/1695209-dragonfly_picture_03_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"On wings of gossamer\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">On wings of gossamer</div></div></div></div>Dragonfly can also utilize her telekinetic ability to physically move all sorts of objects or people around, but this is at the expense of depleting her force field. Since gaining the ability to transform into a different body, her physical appearance have also than changed. When in her Dragonfly state she is taller, much more muscular, with white long hair and green pupils with no iris's.

As a young child, Princess was sent to learn meditation in the small village of Danya located within the Himalayan Mountains. She spent six months there, learning under the tutelage of her sensei, Madiana. Since then she's received extensive combat training as a ninja and ,along with the other members of her team, is unmatched in fighting skill against any opponent.</p><p>In the present, Princess is sixteen years old. She's been a target of romantic interest from her teammates, Mark and Jason, and acts as a big sister to Keyop. She frequents a bar called Club J, though it's not made clear whether she actually works there. (In the animated version of Battle of the Planets, she owns a bar named Snack Jun.) Of the five G-Force team members, she is ranked third behind Mark and Jason, and her bird designation is a swan. With the other four she becomes part of their ultimate attack, the Whirlwind Pyramid.</p><h2>Equipment</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1571433\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4286/1571433-591389_bppr05_super.jpg\" title=\"Enjoy the view.

Attached to her belt is her weapon of choice: an explosive yo-yo. Its unique design includes a long spike capable of penetrating metal armor. She throws it with unerring accuracy and can choose to either use it as a blunt force weapon or detonate it to destroy more dangerous targets.</p><p>She is extremely proficient at riding motorcycles and often uses a technologically advanced version that can transform into a jet-ski. The upper half can hinge open to reveal a large double-barreled blaster weapon.</p><h2>Crossovers</h2><p>Princess has teamed up with <a href=\"/cheetara/29-11143/\">Cheetara</a> when the team landed on Thundara to help the <a href=\"/thundercats/65-15972/\">Thundercats</a> against Spectra.</p><p>Also, Princess was found to be a desirable host for the <a href=\"/witchblade/29-18319/\">Witchblade</a> , and it fed off both her hate and her innate power until her teammates managed to rescue her from its control.</p>",

He was based on Berg Katse, a Gatchaman villain. However the two characters have significant differences. Berg was a high-ranking member of terrorist group Galactor, trying to take over the natural resources of Earth. He appeared to be a normal human but was the result of genetic engineering, fusing together two fraternal twins while in the womb of their mother. As a result Berg was born with both male and female components. His body switched genders numerous times in his life. The process was involuntary in his childhood and teenage years. He learned to control it in adulthood and used both his male and female form as part of a series of disguises. He believed himself to be a superior being. He commited suicide when he discovered his creator Sosai X, an alien, had only created him as a convenient tool and others viewed him as a freak of nature.</p><p>In the American adaptation, Zoltar was himself an alien from planet Spectra instead of a human. His planet was invading Earth and did not employ human operatives. His female-half was changed to be a seperate character, his sister Mala Latroz. Latroz being Zoltar spelled backwards.</p>",

Prior to her brief acting career she had displayed her natural beauty as a model in the 1930's, appearing on the cover of magazines such as Ladies' Home Journal, Life, Look and Redbook.

The art in the Fawcett run is superior art, especially in the early issues. The stories are excellent with much action and many thrills. While the Fawcett issues hail from the Golden Age of Comics and are prior to the Comics Code Authority censorship which began in the mid-1950's, there really are not that many bondage covers here. While there is a fair amount of bondage within the stories and Nyoka faces death door multiple times in many issues, this lovely girl is not the traditional Golden Age helpless female. Nyoka shows an unreal amount of resourcefulness and finds ways to get herself out of some of the worst jams one can imagine.</p><p>Apparently the Nyoka comicbook was popular, as Republic Pictures made two separate cliffhanger serials based upon the jungle heroine. The first one, Jungle Girl, was produced in 1941 and stars Frances Gifford as Nyoka. It is an excellent serial in it's own right, well above average by the way, but it cannot begin compare to the sequel. The 1942 Republic cliffhanger serial called The Perils of Nyoka is a masterpiece! This writer has over 100 cliffhanger serials in his personal collection and considers The Perils of Nyoka, aka Nyoka and the Tigermen, to be the best serial ever released! Lovely Kay Aldridge stars as Nyoka, with Lorna Gray taking the part of her rival and nemesis, Vultura. Clayton Moore of The Longer Ranger fame gets to act of Nyoka's main assistant and Charles Middleton from the Flash Gordon serials gets the part of Vultura's main ally. Not only are the actors and actresses cast perfectly here, but the chapter cliffhanger endings are quite frankly \"as good as it gets\". While many serials have a few cliffhanger endings that are exceptional, this 15-part serial is lucky enough to have every single cliffhanger as well above average and the vast majority of them are exceptional! Truth be told, there are so many first-rate cliffhanger endings in this serial, that it is almost an impossible task to choose which one is the best of all. As if anything else is needed to make this serial a classic, it is loaded with catfights! There are at least four separate fights between Nyoka and Vultura in this serial. One of the differences between the two Nyoka serials is that the 1941 version looks more like sub-Saharan Africa and the 1942 version reminds one more of North Africa locations. There also is a difference in the quality of the prints. While the 1941 serial is in relatively nice shape, the 1942 version looks even better.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Origin</h2><p>The character is one of literary origin and whose story has\nbeen told in comic book adaptations of the classic novel. The story of the Man in the Iron Mask is tied\nto that of <a href=\"/the-three-musketeers/65-56948/\">the Three Musketeers</a>. With a\ncorrupt king on the throne, the Three Musketeers plan to install a secret other\nmember of the royalty on the throne in his place, in this case the king\u2019s\nsecret twin brother that has been hidden away since birth. Having been previously sworn to the service\nof the king the musketeers saw their actions of imprisoning the twin and\nguarding him behind an iron mask as deplorable yet they were bound by their\nservice.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Man in the Iron Mask was created by <a href=\"/alexandre-dumas/26-60125/\">Alexandre\nDumas</a>. In the early years of comics many\ndifferent genres were often tried out in comics and one of these genres was to incorporate\nin illustrated versions of classic novels. The character first appearance was thus in <a href=\"/movie-comics-/37-165278/\">Movie Comics #5</a> in 1939.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>As the character is based around a single novel, which is\nprimarily the only time his story is told, there is in fact little character\nevolution. However, in fact the\ncharacter does mature somewhat through his ordeal, starting as a scared\nprisoner and evolving into the benevolent King of France.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>After his rescue the character is trained by the Three\nMusketeers to act as a kind would. Due\nto unforeseen circumstances they are forced to go ahead with their plan despite\nnot being fully prepared. Eventually the\nking is replaced and the Man in the Iron Mask takes his place to rule\npeacefully over the land.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>The Man in the iron Mask is a regular man, though he shows a\nnatural leadership ability as well as the ability to quickly adapt himself to\nthe training of the Three Musketeers.</p>",
