The filmmakers' goal was to create \"The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror\" , as a movie so relentless that it would stand forever as a landmark in modern horror history. When it was released in 1980, it was immediately recognized worldwide as one of the most ferociously original films ever made. Twenty years late, this is THE EVIL DEAD like you've never seen or heard it before. <br />&nbsp;<br />Ever-present, ever-listening , the Evil Dead lie in wait for the one ancient incantation that will give them license to possess the living. Watch in horror as five vacationing college students unwittingly resurrect these slumbering demons, and are forced into battle with the supernatural forces that occupy the forests and dark bowers of man's domain. They find the <a href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/18-55588/\"> </a></i><i> </i><i> </i><i> </i><a href=\"/necronomicon-ex-mortis/18-55588/\"> <i>Necronomicon</i></a>, <i>the book of the dead, and the taped translation of the text. Once the tape is played, the evil is released. The innocent must suffer. The guilty must be punished. One-by-one, the students are possessed by these demons whose thirst for revenge is insatiable. As the night wanes, only one man remains... Ash. He must now defend himself while trying to uncover the horrible secret of THE EVIL DEAD. <br />&nbsp;<br />THE EVIL DEAD will pull scream after scream from the base of your spine and from the depths of your soul.</i>",

With <a href=\"/conan/29-2438/\">Conan</a>\u2019s Arnold Schwarzenegger as Lord Kalidor (actually Conan but with his name changed due to a copyright dispute) and Sandahl Bergman (who played <a href=\"/valeria/29-37724/\">Valeria</a> in the first Conan movie) as <a href=\"/queen-gedren/29-75703/\">Queen Gedren</a>, Sonja isn\u2019t your average continuation of a film series. Red Sonja has almost nothing in common with the Conan films other than the use of the same actors (in different roles).</p><p><strong>PLOT</strong></p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\"><div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\"><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/red-sonja/223-127/#\">SPOILER WARNING: Click here to reveal hidden content.</a></div><div class=\"js-spoiler-div\"><p>The story begins with a flashback. After the teenage Sonja rejected Queen Gedren's offer to be her consort, the queen had Sonja\u2019s family murdered. Sonja was then viciously raped by the queen\u2019s men, but she managed to inflict damage to Gedren\u2019s face \u2013 causing a scar that she will later cover with a gold mask. A spirit (the goddess <a href=\"/scathach/29-59911/\">Scathach</a>, though unnamed in the film) visits Sonja and gives her the ability to seek revenge on those who have wronged her.</p><p>In a temple, priestesses are about to destroy a powerful artifact called the Talisman (which was used to create the Earth, and only women can touch it and live) in order to prevent it from destroying everything else. Gedren\u2019s army attacks the temple to steal the Talisman. A priestess named Varna manages to escape the temple and gets just far enough to reach Lord Kalidor \u2013 before she is shot in the back with an arrow -- and asks him to help find Red Sonja, who is apparently her sister.</p><p>Red Sonja has trained with a Chinese sword master, and that is where Kalidor finds her. Varna insists that Sonja find the Talisman and destroy it and then dies from her wound. Sonja is reluctant to accept help from Kalidor, but he follows close behind on her journey. Sonja encounters a few ignorant men on her way, which provokes fights and encourages her distaste for men \u2013 but she does manage to form a bond with the young prince Tarn and his servant Falkon.</p><p>The Talisman is placed in a room full of candles in Castle Berkubane on Gedren\u2019s orders although she is advised against it. As Sonja\u2019s assembly approach the castle Gedren recognizes her and wants her taken unharmed. While taking shelter in a watery cave from a storm caused by the Talisman, Sonja is faced by a metal monster; Kalidor wrestles it and she gouges out its eyes. After this Sonja accepts Kalidor. Sonja tells Kalidor that she \u2018will never lie with any man unless he can defeat her in a sword fight\u2019 and he later challenges her. Neither is able to defeat the other, but Sonja begins to have feelings for Kalidor.</p><p>As they infiltrate the castle the Talisman is growing unstable and it starts to break apart the castle. Sonja battles Gedren and disarms her hated enemy, shattering her sword and impaling her. Gedren then falls to her death, and Sonja hurls the Talisman in after her. The castle is destroyed and Sonja and her party manage to barely escape as a volcano rises from the ruins. The film ends with Sonja and Kalidor sharing a kiss.</p></div></div>",

Just then, Terry arrives and tries to beat them, but they manage to escape with the component. However, while chasing them, Terry has stopped them from getting the component, but they escaped. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the Batcave, an elderly Bruce is practicing throwing Batarangs at the cardboards of his enemies. Just then, Terry arrives and plans to go to a nightclub. Bruce suggests that he needs some sleep, but Terry refuses, saying that he doesn't need some sleep like Bruce is. <br />&nbsp;<br />However, Terry begins to feel tired while inside the nightclub. <br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, in an abandoned candy factory, the Jokerz give a chip to the mysterious figure. However, he is not happy that he got that and calls them a disgrace to the name Joker. When he is saying about in his day, Bonk is getting tired of that concept and thinks that his leader is a fake, but he isn't bothered by it. Bonk tells the gang that their leader has hired them, but gives them no money and won't tell them about his plans. He asks the figure that he wants out which causes the latter to point his gun at Bonk. He tells him that he is just kidding. Just then, the figure fires his gun, but it is only \"Bang!\" flag, stating that he is also kidding; however, he shoots the flag onto Bonk's chest, killing him. <br />&nbsp;<br />The mysterious figure is revealed to be Joker and throws his gun, saying that is what he does in his day. He finds Gotham becoming new and a new Batman, and now that he's back, he's planning to give this town a wedgie again. Joker asks his gang if they were with him and they reply in a nervous manner. He begins to ask each member if they were with him and they reply that they're with him. Joker asks Bonk, but he's dead and orders Dee Dee to throw his body. He decided to forget about the mishap and start all over. <br />&nbsp;<br />Joker orders Ghoul to find a component for a device and the former finds one place. However, the latter states that the security is tight, but Joker asks them to think about the fun. <br />&nbsp;<br />Bruce and Terry arrive in a party at Wayne Industries. The former is about to make a speech when the lights go out. Meanwhile, Chucko and Ghoul are trying to steal a component for a device. At the same time, Bruce gets into a fight with Woof. Despite being an old man, he can still kick his butt. When Terry asks if he's gonna be okay, Bruce replies to go to work. <br />&nbsp;<br />Just then, Dee Dee arrive and attacks Bruce. A purple spotlight appears, revealing Joker. He tells Gotham that he's back and uses his trademark laugh. Bruce is shocked by this, but Joker tells him that this is no trick. Just then, Terry arrives and Joker orders Woof to get him. Joker asks Chucko and Ghoul if they got the device which they did. He summons a flying vehicle and salutes Bruce with a goodbye. <br />&nbsp;<br />Terry tries to get him, but Joker destroys a portion of the balcony, sending two people about to fall to their deaths. He asks him what is his decision and Terry leaves. Joker smiles sinisterly as he knows what he decided. Terry saves the two people from falling. <br />&nbsp;<br />After the incident, Terry knows what Bruce is thinking that he just let Joker got away to save the people. The latter replies that he did the right thing, and the former asks about Joker. However, Bruce doesn't answer and orders Terry to just drive. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the next morning, Terry goes to Commissioner Barbara Gordon to ask her questions about Joker. Afterwards, a man named Tim Drake goes to her. <br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Bruce is checking a profile on his archenemy, and checks if the voices match in order to make sure there is no impostor impersonating Joker. Terry arrives and knows all of the original Batman's enemies, but didn't mention about Joker. When he asks if the latter is the biggest one, Bruce replies that this isn't a popularity contest and that Joker is a psychopath, a monster. Terry asks that how could Joker be still around, and Bruce replies that he died years ago and he saw it. Just then, Bruce orders Terry to give him the Batsuit so that he will not be endangered. The latter throws it to him in anger. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the next morning, Matt is angered with Terry and calls his mother about him. She replies that Terry is his big brother and the main reason Matt doesn't see him much is because of his work with Bruce. Terry says that he doesn't work with him anymore and his mother is happy about having him home, much to Matt's dismay. Terry plays a prank on him by flicking a piece of cereal onto his face. <br />&nbsp;<br />At the night, Terry is in a nightclub trying to dance with Dana, but she's attacked by two twin girls. At the same time, Bruce is working at the Batcave creating an antidote for Joker's toxin. Just then, his pet dog, Ace, is attacked and Joker's gas is spreading in the cave. Bruce tries to get to the antidote, but drops it. Joker arrives and pins him to a chair, saying \"Hello, Batman\". <br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Terry is attacked by the Jokerz in the nightclub. While fighting them, Dana is injured. After defeating the gang, Terry tries to call Bruce, but nothing. He goes to his manor to find it and the Batcave a mess. Terry finds Bruce almost being infected by Joker's toxin, and the latter asks him to be injected with the antidote. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the next morning, Bruce is recovering from the toxin. Barbara has decided to tell Terry the story of what happened to Joker. <br />&nbsp;<br />It is revealed that in one night, Robin is abducted by Joker and his love interest, Harley Quinn. Batman and Batgirl go to Arkham Asylum to confront them. When the former tries to get to Robin, Harley traps him with a ribbon. Joker has revealed that he made Robin into a Joker-like child. Angered, Batman breaks free and throws a Batarang at Joker, but he dodges it. Batman chases Joker around while Batgirl fights with Harley. <br />&nbsp;<br />The latter tries to kill Batgirl with a bazooka, but she is hit. Batgirl tries to save Harley, but she falls to her presumable death. Meanwhile, Joker reveals to Batman on how he turned Robin to the way he is and now knows that he is Bruce Wayne. He taunts Batman that he is little boy in a playsuit crying for his parents, and laughs. Batman begins to beat him and plans to kill him, but Joker taunts Batman he should have done that years ago and slashes him in the chest and stabs his leg with a knife. Joker tells Batman that he has lost and the last sound he'll hear will be their laughter, and orders Robin to kill him with a gun. However, Robin shoots Joker instead and the latter remarks that this is not funny before dying. <br />&nbsp;<br />Batgirl arrives to find Robin begin crying and tries to comfort him. <br />&nbsp;<br />Ever since the incident, Batman has ordered Tim and Barbara to give up their alter egos so that he will not endanger them. When Terry asks Barbara about Harley, she replies that she never found her body. <br />&nbsp;<br />Terry goes to Tim to get some answers. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the night, Price is attacked by the Jokerz, the gang whom he hires to beat Bruce. Terry arrives to save him, but turns him over to the police after revealing evidence that he used the Jokerz for his plot. <br />&nbsp;<br />While Terry is researching in the Batcave, Bruce comes down, having finally recovered. He reveals about the components for a device. <br />&nbsp;<br />Terry goes to Tim to tell him that he knows about his connection to the Joker. However, he doesn't seem to hear him, and when Terry touches him, it is just a hologram and is led into a trap. Just then, Joker appears from a screen and reveals on how Tim is on his employ and reveals a device that zaps lasers for his plot. Terry has managed to escape the trap. <br />&nbsp;<br />He plans to go to Joker's hideout, an abandoned candy factory. Joker sends the laser on, but he turns it off when he feels strange. The Jokerz try to attack Terry, but to no avail. <br />&nbsp;<br />Inside the factory, Terry finds Tim there and knows that the latter is working for Joker. Just then, Tim traps Terry and begins laughing. Just then, he transforms into Joker. It is revealed that while Robin is in captivity, Joker uses a microchip with his DNA on Robin which explains of the transformation. However, he has limited time being in Tim's body as he is not aware of what Joker does. When his family misses him, Joker would use Tim's voice that he is working late. Soon, he will be strong to be in taking over Tim's body permanently. <br />&nbsp;<br />Joker plans to hit on three spots: the hospital where Dana, the McGinnis residence when Matt and Mary McGinnis, and Wayne Manor where Bruce is. When he asks Terry if he has any last words, the latter sics Ace on Joker. However, he uses an electric buzzer on him, and just as he about to kill him, Terry stops him, sending his buzzer to the device that causes the laser to go to the factory. <br />&nbsp;<br />Terry tries to turn Joker in, but the latter beats him up easily. He tells Terry that he is out of his lead because he know every trick that the original Batman has. When Terry states that he doesn't know a thing about him, Joker taunts him that he's just an errand boy taking orders from a senile old man. <br />&nbsp;<br />Terry locks up the doors and fights Joker; however, he is beaten easily and asks Bruce for advice. He replies to block his talking. Terry tries to use his talking on the Joker, but it fails. Joker traps Terry with a table and orders him to laugh. The latter laughs and destroys the microchip, killing Joker again. Terry rescues Tim as they escape from the factory. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the city jail, Dee Dee is bailed out by their grandmother who is disappointed with them. Meanwhile, in the next morning, Tim is taken to the hospital with Terry and Barbara visiting. Just then, Bruce arrives and tells Terry that it is not being Batman that makes him a worthy person, but the other way around. He goes to Tim and Barbara afterwards. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the night, Terry dons the Batsuit and flies around Gotham, understanding his responsibilities as the new Batman.",

        "description":"<h2>&nbsp;Full Plot&nbsp;</h2>Starting during the final days during World War II, a elite group of soldiers lead by Steve Rogers, a.k.a Captain America attacked a Nazi strong hold controlled by the human/atari hybrid, Herr Kleiser, who has built a destructive missle he intends to launch at Wasington DC. During a hard battle wtih Kleiser and his men, Cap is unable to keep the missle from launching but instead hitches a ride on it and lest Kleiser's castle self destruct around him. Captain America is able to disarm the missle over the artic but falls into the sea as the missle breaks up. During is final thoughts, he thinks of his girlfriend before disappearing in the deep. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />60 years later, Cap's body is found frozen in ice by Betty Ross and Bruce Banner who have been assigned by SHIELD to recover Captain America's body and create a new super soldier program in the planet's effort to defeat the Atari race. A few days later after recovering Cap's body, Nick Fury, the head of SHIELD is having the final pieces of a defense satilite that will help fight against the Atari but it's destroyed just after going online by the alien race. Angry over the situation and not wanting to wait on the super soldier program, the World Council tells Fury to activate Project Avengers. A group composed to Earth's Mightiest Super heroes, something Fury isn't the most keen on. He starts by seeking out Janet Van Dyne and Dr. Hank Pym. While Jan doesn't have a problem, Hank has had it with SHIELD constantly screwing him over but Fury needs him non the less. Hank decides to accept Fury's offer and then shows his new ability to grow to giant size to show that he does a lot more than talk to ants as a super hero these days.<br />&nbsp; Meanwhile, Fury sends the Black Widow after Tony Stark to help convince him to have Iron Man join the group but Stark isn't too thrilled with having Iron Man join the team, saying he works alone. However, he's more than happy to help SHIELD out with some new weapon designs to help in his little war with the Atari. Not long afterwards, Bruce Banner and his group of scientists are working on Captain America's body which has now been defrosted. However, soon a pulse is found and Captain America springs to life but is disorented as a result of his 60 years and attacks all the SHIELD agents that try to subdue him. Cap eventually breaks outside and sees that he's in New York but&nbsp; not his time, he turns to see Fury and asks: \"Did we win?\" Fury answers: \"We did son, we did.\" The next couple of days, Cap is filled in about what happened since he's been gone and that Fury wants him to lead the Avengers. While Cap is a bit hesitant, he soon agrees and learns about each member of his new team and about the truth of Bruce Banner who is secretly the Hulk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Steve Rogers is filled in about what the world around him and he and Fury even go out to recruit, the&nbsp;Norse&nbsp;god of Thunder, Thor who is helping with some political rallies. During a drink at a bar, Thor openly rejects Fury's officer but seems to know Captain America better than he should after all these years. Not long after that, Steve decides to seek out his old girlfriend, who has now married James Barnes, his old partner, Bucky from the war. James tells Steve that it was hard for her all these years he was gone but&nbsp;Steve let's James know that he is happy that she married him. He then departs with her looking out the window.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />A couple days later after&nbsp;starting to&nbsp;train with the Avengers, the Atari attack New York and the Avengers spring into action, including Iron Man who tries to help them out. During the battle, Iron Man's armor is damaged and he is revealed to be Tony Stark, much to Nick Fury's displeasure. The Avengers get the upper hand on the Atari but they soon attack a few days later and Fury, needing his new super soldiers orders Bruce Banner to move the program along but it's revealed that Banner never intended to use the super soldier program from the government but in an effort to cure himself but the experiment goes wrong and Banner turns into the Hulk again just as the Atari attack their base. Both Iron Man and Thor join the Avengers in fighting the Atari but even their numbers are still not enough against the alien warlords. Soon, the Hulk ends up fighting the Avengers during the battle until Betty turns towards the Atari and in doing so, starts destroying their ships with ease, leaving the Avengers to push back and defeat the Atari who quickly return to space defeated.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The next day, Fury congradulates the Avengers on a job well done but promises them that the Atari are hurt but more of their pride than their numbers. They'll be back and they will stop them.&nbsp; Not long after, Steve finally sees his old girlfriend, who he greets with a hug, saying she has missed him but knows that he always was meant for something more and Steve knods his head. Now with the world in danger, it's going to take Earth's Mightest to stop threats both wordly and outworldly, hence, the Avengers Assemble.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><h2>Trailer</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage \" rel=\"video\">\n<center><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/R_Tgw6f61Vg\" wmode=\"transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></center></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p>",

        "description":"<p>Serenity is the continuation of the epic space western TV series \u201cFirefly\u201d. In the year 2518 the crew of Serenity carry out less than honest jobs to stay alive. This Crew includes Mal, Jayne, Simon, River, Wash, and Zoe. &nbsp;Human kind has relocated to a new star system living on terra-formed planets run by the Alliance. <?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?></p>\n<p><b><u>PLOT:</u></b></p>\n<div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"spoiler\">\n<div class=\"js-spoiler-btn\"><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/serenity/223-140/#\">SPOILER WARNING: Click here to reveal hidden content.</a></div>\n<div style=\"OVERFLOW: hidden\" class=\"js-spoiler-div\">\n<p>The Film opens with a replay of the events surrounding Simon\u2019s rescue of his sister River; in what appears to be a school setting, we see River as a child questioning the Alliance. The scene then changes to a young adult River being tested on in an Alliance facility. Simon has infiltrated the base and is able to extract River. The replay pauses. A man who is called the Operative is then shown. He has been sent to find River. He kills everyone else in the room with him. </p>\n<p>&nbsp;As the Crew is in the process of raiding a bank River senses that Reavers are going to attack. Mal instructs the people inside the bank to get into the vault lock it and stay in there as long as they can and the crew manages to escape the Reavers. Simon decides that he and River are going to leave the ship the next time they dock, since it is becoming increasingly dangerous for her. As they are negotiating payment for the bounty from the bank job, River arrives and unexpectedly attacks everyone in the bar. She is about to assault Mal but Simon says the safe word which makes River stop and fall asleep. Simon and River are allowed to stay on the ship. They then contact Mr. Universe, a skilled hacker who discovers River\u2019s outburst at the bar was caused by subliminal messaging in the advertisement that was playing at the time. The subliminal messaging is controlled by the Alliance. Mr. Universe shares that River whispered \u201cMiranda\u201d right before her sudden assault on the bar.</p>\n<p>Inara, a former passenger on Serenity calls Mal. The call was a trap which is mean to lure Mal and his crew to the Operative. Mal knowing it is a trap decides to go &nbsp;because he thinks she may be in trouble. The Operative wants River and offers the let everyone else go if Mel turns her over. They manage to escape without having to give up River. </p>\n<p>River has another outburst and they learn that Miranda is an uninhabitable outer planet. Serenity sets out for Haven but they discover the settlement has been attacked by the alliance. Shepherd Book (a Former Passenger) is mortally wounded. The attack was because of the Operatives search for River. &nbsp; The crew modifies Serenity to look like a Reaver ship, and the leave for Miranda which is located within Reaver territory. &nbsp; When they reach Miranda they discover it had been a normal planet, but that the streets are polluted with corpses. They find out that this was where the Reavers originated from due to a chemical designed to suppress aggression which was administered by the Alliance. </p>\n<p>The crew asks Mr. Universe to help them get this out to the public, &nbsp;and he agrees. The only problem is that they crew doesn\u2019t know that The Operative is with Mr. Universe and murdered him after the transmission ended. &nbsp; As serenity is exiting Reaver territory they encounter a Reaver ship. They crash into the planet. Wash is then killed by a Reaver harpoon. The surviving crew flees serenity and find Mr. Universe dead. He left a message telling them of another Transmitter. &nbsp; The Reavers are approaching and the crew is forced to leave. Simon is shot and River closed a door between the Reavers and the rest of the crew locking herself inside to fight the Reavers. </p>\n<p>Mal finds the transmitter but is stopped by the Operative and they engage in battle. Mal wins against the Operative, and gets him to watch the log that reveals that the Alliance created the Reavers as he leaves to rejoin the others. As Mal is informed that River is inside with the Reapers, the door opens and we see River surrounded by dead Reavers. &nbsp;The Operative orders his Alliance troops to resign from their mission.</p>\n<p>The crew buries their dead and repair Serenity. Kaylee and Simon finally have sex and the Operative informs Mal that the crew of Serenity is safe, but Mal promises to kill him if he ever sees him again. &nbsp; Serenity takes off, with Mal acting as pilot with the help of River. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div></div>",

However, Banner's captives continue to torture him until the Santari arrive and try to kill Banner, who soon \"hulks out\" and attacks his attackers and leaves the base. The Wakanda Council continues to igonore the Avengers help using the crashed Santari technology to keep their forces back but Kleiser soon discovers the truth and they deactivate the ship, causing their defenses to drop. In doing so, the Santari Base Ship approaches the planet and encases the country in an energy shield while Captain America and the Black Panther&nbsp;battle Kleiser.&nbsp;Below in Wakanda with the&nbsp;gamma ray being used by the Avengersthe Santari are weakened, and Iron Man (using his War Machine Armor)&nbsp;and Giant Man(Henry Pym) manage to destroy the core of an attacking&nbsp;Santari vessel. Giant-Man, however, is fatally injured and dies. Captain America and the Black Panther who are unable to truly kill&nbsp;Kleiser instead bury him in&nbsp;liquid vibranium, leaving him trapped and unable to regnerate and bury him deep within the palace, never to be heard from again. Later,&nbsp;the team departs with the thanks of the Black Panther, and on returning learn that Banner has become the Hulk and escape. They later hold a funeral for Hank Pym and the Black Widow and Captain America finally kiss and begin a relationship together.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=\"js-item-cage \" rel=\"video\">\n<center><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/KLiS8xmlbmo\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" wmode=\"transparent\" width=\"425\" height=\"344\"></embed></center></div>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br /></p>",

Enraged, Eddie attacks him and leaves. When Angelo asks Eddie's girlfriend, Dolores, why does he hate toons, she replies that a toon killed Eddie's brother, Teddy, by dropping a piano on his head. <br />&nbsp;<br />In one night, Eddie tries to investigate Jessica Rabbit, Roger's wife, when a gorilla kicks him out for sneaking to her dressing room. He gives Roger pictures of Jessica \"cheating\" on him by playing patty-cake with Marvin Acme, enraging Roger as he runs away. <br />&nbsp;<br />Just then, a murder of Acme occurs in Acme Warehouse. Roger has become the main suspect of this case. Eddie and Lieutenant Santino see Judge Doom, a corrupt judge of Toontown. He has his henchmen, the Weasels, to search for Roger. When a toon shoe goes near him, Doom shows Eddie and Santino how he deals with toons. He kills a toon shoe by using the Dip, a concoction used to kill toons since they are immortal at being shot, run over, burned, and other injuries. <br />&nbsp;<br />When Eddie goes back to his office, he is greeted by Baby Herman, who warns him that if Acme's will is not found, Toontown will be sold to Cloverleaf Industries, which had bought the Red Car trolley line. Roger arrives at Eddie's office to tell him that in a jealous rage, he just wrote Jessica a love letter. Eddie threatens Roger that he will call the police, leading Roger and himself to be handcuffed as the Weasels arrive. <br />&nbsp;<br />When they arrive, Smart Ass, the leader, questions Eddie about Roger in his place. Eddie puts soap into Smart Ass as he falls from the stairs, causing the Weasels to laugh at him being injured. Smart Ass attacks him, warning them that they will die from too much laughter, and leaves the office. <br />&nbsp;<br />Upon arriving at a bar, Eddie has managed to free himself from Roger and goes to his office to find Jessica there. <br />&nbsp;<br />By the time he goes back to the bar, Eddie finds Roger dancing and berates him for that. Doom arrives with the Weasels looking for Roger. He senses that Roger is in the bar and throws a cd at Stupid, causing the Weasels to laugh. Doom attacks Smart Ass and reminds him that if he and the other Weasels don't stop laughing, they're gonna die. When Smart Ass asks him to disassemble the bar, Doom says that there's no need for that and uses the \"Shave and Haircut\" trick to lure Roger out, which he got out and Doom grabs him in his neck. <br />&nbsp;<br />Just as Doom is about to kill Roger, Eddie made Roger drink alcohol, causing him to have an outburst as they escape from Doom. They drive away with Benny the Cab, leading to a chase between them and the Weasels. They drive to a theater afterwards. <br />&nbsp;<br />Inside, Roger asks Eddie why does he hate toons. <br />&nbsp;<br />It is revealed that a toon killed Eddie's brother, Teddy, by dropping a piano on to his head. The toon escapes from Toontown and Eddie manages to remember his description: red eyes and squeaky voice. <br />&nbsp;<br />At the night, Eddie goes to Maroon Studios to meet with R.K. Maroon. Unknown to him, Roger is knocked down by a mysterious assailant and is dragged away. <br />&nbsp;<br />At the studio, Maroon refuses to tell Eddie as he is going to be dead if he confesses everything. However, an unseen gunman kills Maroon and Eddie follows the assailant to Toontown. <br />&nbsp;<br />Upon entering there, he encounters Jessica, whom he thinks that she is the murderer, but she reveals that the long revolver is the gun used to kill Maroon and Doom is responsible for the murder. Eddie, Jessica, and Benny escape from the Weasels. However, by the time they leave Toontown, Doom stops them by using the Dip on Benny. <br />&nbsp;<br />He takes Eddie and Jessica to the Acme factory where he orders the Weasels to look for Acme's will. But since it is not found, Doom will get a chance to own Toontown. <br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Roger finds Benny injured as they drive to the Acme factory. <br />&nbsp;<br />In the Acme factory, Doom reveals that he is going to retire being judge of Toontown. When Eddie asks him about Cloverleaf Industries, Doom replies that he is the stockholder of it. Roger goes to the warehouse by being flushed down the toilet. <br />&nbsp;<br />Meanwhile, Doom reveals to erase Toontown and rebuild a freeway from it. Just then, Roger appears, but is knocked down by a falling ton of bricks by Greasy. Doom orders Roger and Jessica to be tied up and tells Eddie that it is over and walks away. However, he slips through the eyeballs and upon hearing the Weasels laugh, warns them that they're gonna die from too much laughing, giving Eddie an idea. When Smart Ass if he can kill Eddie, Doom replies that he can watch first Roger and Jessica die, then he can kill Eddie. <br />&nbsp;<br />Eddie manages to get the Weasels, except Smart Ass, from laughing themselves to death. His song is interrupted when he gets hit by a vase and Roger says \"nose\". When Smart Ass points out that nose doesn't rhyme with walls, Eddie kicks him in the crotch and sends him to his death by the Dip. Greasy dies from much laughter, but not before he starts the vehicle that he is driving. Psycho also dies, but not before he sets the Dip onto Roger and Jessica. <br />&nbsp;<br />When Eddie sends the Dip to the other side, Doom kicks him off the vehicle and his cane-sword to attack Eddie. Eddie tries using a magnet, but is trapped. Doom tries to get him killed by running him over with a steamroller, but Eddie kicks him out of it. When Doom tries to punch him, Eddie manages to cover Doom's hand with glue and uses it as a diversion to shut down the Dip machine. <br />&nbsp;<br />Afterwards, Eddie sees Doom being flatten by the steamroller. However, Doom is reveals to be a toon when his body becomes flat like toons are. He reinflates himself and reveals to Eddie that he is the toon who killed his brother. Doom tries to kill Eddie with a chainsaw hand, but Eddie kills him by using the Dip on him. <br />&nbsp;<br />Eddie cleans up the factory by using water and puts Roger and Jessica down. Just then, the toons arrive to find Doom's remains. Roger has revealed to have Acme's will all along by love letter. When he accidentally electrocuted Eddie with a joybuzzer, Roger thinks that he is mad at him. Instead, Eddie grabs Roger and kisses him. <br />&nbsp;<br />The toons celebrate their victory with a song.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Plot</h2>The film begins, much like the book, in Whitechapel in 1888. A group of prostitutes in the East End of London suddenly become swept up in a conspiracy as a royal illegitimacy and the scandal it causes has dreadful repercussions. First, their friend Annie Crook is kidnapped and imprisoned in an insane asylum, then members of the close-knit group of prostitutes start getting murdered and mutilated by the serial killer who would come to be known as Jack the Ripper. Inspector Frederick Abberline, a troubled young detective with psychic powers, is drawn into the case first by his powerful visions, and then by his growing relationship with one of the prostitutes, Mary Kelly.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Abberline continues to investigate, soon uncovering the sinister influence of the Freemasons in the murders and subsequent coverup. He discovers that Sir William Gull, a doctor and prominent Freemason, is the killer. The murders, it is revealed, have been committed to cover up the fact that Prince Edward Albert Victor had secretly married Annie Crook, and had a child by her. Gull is tried secretly by the Freemasons and lobotomized to protect the royal family, and imprisoned in an asylum. Mary Kelly is revealed to have escaped to her native Ireland along with the Prince's daughter, as another woman was killed in her place. Abberline is found dead of an opium overdose. &nbsp;<br /><h2>Relationship with the Book and History</h2>Because the book itself is based on a widely discredited theory, the use of assessing the veracity of the theory proposed in the film is minimal. The historical inaccuracies in this film are myriad, and go beyond even those that the viewer must accept to allow for the basic theory of royal illegitimacy. On the whole this consists mainly of merging characters, such as Abberline and the psychic Robert Lees or Prince Albert Victor with Walter Sickert; renaming characters for unknown reasons, such as George Godley becoming Thomas Godley, or Prince Albert Victor becoming Prince Edward Albert Victor; or a general disregard for the facts of the case, such as the then-45 and married Abberline being in his mid-thirties, single and an opium addict.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />The movie also does not remain true to the book in a number of ways. The film is a whodunit, and the identity of the killer is not revealed until later in the movie, while in the book Gull's identity is not made secret. Discussion of the occult or the supernatural is almost completely removed from the film, and where it still exists has been greatly compressed.&nbsp;Mary Kelly's lesbianism and promiscuity is passed off to Elizabeth Stride, and she is instead placed in a romantic relationship with Abberline, whose friendship to her was incidental to the case when it appears in the book.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />From Hell has received mostly mixed reviews. It has 6.9 stars out of 10 on <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120681/\" rel=\"nofollow\">IMDb</a>, 3 out of 5 stars on <a href=\"http://www.allmovie.com/work/254552\" rel=\"nofollow\">AllMovie</a>,&nbsp;57% from <a href=\"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/from_hell/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, a C  from <a href=\"http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=fromhell.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Box Office Mojo</a> and a C- from E! Online. Most fans of the original book do not celebrate the film, as is common with a majority of films based on Alan Moore's work",

        "description":"<p>The Teen Titans encounter a new villain in their home town of Jump City, an advanced ninja named Saico-Tek. Capturing him means following a trail of clues to discover Saico's true chief commander: Brushogun, which eventually leads them to Tokyo, Japan. Once there, the team battles a beast that appears to be working for Brushogun, as well. Nearing defeat by the monster, the Titans meet up with Daizo Uehara, the Commander of the Tokyo Troopers armed forces. Assuring them that all will handled in terms of apprehending Brushogun, the Teen Titans set out to enjoy Tokyo as a vacation, while they are still there, although Robin, as overworking and serious minded as usual, is reluctant to join them. However, he soon forgets work for a little while, and enjoys some romantic moments with Starfire, which is featured as a predominant subplot throughout the film.</p><p>Meanwhile, each individual member of the team explores Japan as they see fitting: Cyborg wandering around town for food, Beast Boy on the never ending quest for chicks, and Raven for some reading material, which is apparently impossible, even after the ability of reading six languages. Little known to them, they have each been followed by mysterious shadows, and are soon ambushed one by one. Robin encounters Saico-Tek once again, and engages in a struggle on the rooftops. In a fit of rage, he is shown to have killed Saico, and is promptly arrested by the Tokyo Troopers.</p><p>After spending time in prison, then in a transport vehicle, a mysterious explosive disc frees Robin, who is now a wanted man. With all of the Troopers searching for him, he dons a new disguise, stolen from a would-be mugger in an alley way. This little get up is no match for Daizo, as him and the rest of his combat squad soon locate Robin, and a high speed pursuit through Tokyo ensues. After being surrounded and seeing no way out, Robin is forced to surrender, when all of a sudden, his rescue angel by the name of Starfire swoops in and flies them off to safety.</p><p>Now in a secluded temple, Robin and Starfire share some soft spoken words, and the two love birds attempt another go at their first kiss. This is stopped short, <i>again</i>, by the forms of Beast Boy. Reunited once again, the team learns through Raven's discoveries, the legacy of Brushogun. The Troopers soon interrupt their get together, and once again, the Titans are on the run. Finally shaking them off of their trail, the team winds up in a final battle against Brushogun, and ultimately defeats him. Robin and Starfire soon share their long awaited kiss, and the couple shows off their new relationship to the public at the Titan's honorary ceremony. Each are awarded medals, and the Teen Titans are declared heroes.</p>",

Although these androids have a lifespan of four years, it occasionally becomes necessary to \"retire\" or terminate them should they return to Earth (where they are illegal) or cause a disturbance. The members of the police force designated to do this, are blade runners.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />  Deckard is weary of his blade runner work, but agrees to track down three renegade replicants, Roy Batty, Pris, and Zhora. Along the way, Deckard copes with his strong feelings for Tyrell's assistant Rachel, and the need to assert his own humanity.",
