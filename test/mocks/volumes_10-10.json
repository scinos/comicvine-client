        "description":"Planet Comics, launched by Fiction House in 1940 came just fifteen months after their first and most&nbsp;successful&nbsp;title, <a href=\"/jumbo-comics/49-769/\">Jumbo Comics</a>. Like Jumbo, this title was also an anthology, but all the stories revolved around a common science fiction theme. Although it's predecessor lasted for many more issues, Planet Comics was published at a bimonthly rate for most of its run meaning it too ended in 1953 with its 73rd issue. Planet Comics serves as one of the best examples of \"<a href=\"/good-girl-art/12-45911/\">Good Girl Art</a>\", a movement commonly associated with the Golden Age of Comics in which gorgeous women would often be posed to show off their beauty, which many of the covers show. However, Planet also had stories featuring women as the sole heroine such as <a href=\"/mysta-of-the-moon/29-1321/\">Mysta of the Moon</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"/gale-allen/29-1315/\">Gale Allen</a>. Other popular stories included \"The Space Rangers\" (which merged the Flint Baker and Reef Ryan strips), \"Star Pirate\", \"Mars, God of War\", \"The Red Comet\" and \"The Lost World\" (featuring Hunt Bowman, this was the lead feature for a large part of the book's run).",

In 1940, he got his own ongoing series kicking off with \"The Human Torch Comics #2\", the elusive first issue actually being <a href=\"/red-raven-comics/49-19964/\">Red Raven Comics</a> #1. More confusion would stem from the fact that #4 (the third issue) read #3 on the cover and there was no cover with a 4 since there were actually two issues labeled #5. Following the early mix-ups with issue numbering however the series began a proper numbering with #6 (which <i>was</i> actually the sixth issue, rather then the 5th which it would have been had the original numbering been kept). The comic went on to last for 38 issues but due to the fact that the first 29 were published at a quarterly rate, it was only in 1954 that the final issue came out.",

        "description":"<p>Four Favorites was an inconsistently published anthology comic series that primarily focused on four specific characters per issue (the \"four favorites\"). The original line-up was all superheroes with \"<a href=\"/magno/29-4110/\">Magno</a> (and <a href=\"/davey/29-61258/\">Davey</a>)\", \"<a href=\"/lash-lightning/29-34148/\">Lash Lightning</a>\", \"<a href=\"/vulcan/29-18744/\">Vulcan</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/raven/29-6537/\">The Raven</a>\". With the fourth issue, Vulcan was switched out for <a href=\"/soldier-unknown/29-61008/\">Unknown Soldier</a> (predates the DC character of the same name) and in the following issue The Raven was replaced by <a href=\"/captain-courageous/29-18821/\">Captain Courageous</a>. The Flag took Captain Courageous' spot in the next issue, but with #7 Capt. Courageous returned and the line-up remained consistent up until the 21st issue when Unknown Soldier was replaced by an unrelated character called \"<a href=\"/the-unknown/29-76050/\">The Unknown</a>\". In #24, Lightning was replaced with <a href=\"/hap-hazard/29-75788/\">Hap Hazard</a> by which point the comic no longer retained a consistent genre and expanded into several. With #26, the last of the original features was cut and the line-up from that point on changed every issue until it settled on four characters for the last three issues but superheroes were no longer featured in the publication and when the series ended in 1947, it was a teen humor publication. Two issues followed #32, under different titles: #33 was called <a href=\"/crime-must-pay-the-penalty/49-40505/\">Crime Must Pay the Penalty</a> (which became its own long-running series) and #34 was titled <a href=\"/four-teeners/49-32020/\">Four Teeners</a>.</p>",

        "description":"<p>Captain Marvel Adventures was one of several ongoings during the Golden Age starring Fawcett's Captain Marvel, who was more popular than Superman in the late 40's and early 50's. The series told the adventures of young Billy Batson, who by speaking the magic word \"SHAZAM!\" would receive super powers. Trouble was, these powers were kind of similar to those attributed to the Man of Steel. Depite the fact that Captain Marvel's stories tended to have a lighter and more humourous element to them, DC was not impressed. After a protracted plagiarism lawsuit, which DC eventually won, Cap and the rest of the Marvel Family disappeared from the comic world for about 20 years. Funnily enough, they would re-appear at DC.</p>",
