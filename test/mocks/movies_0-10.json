        "description":"<p>The film Daredevil starts off with Daredevil at a church, weakened and nearly unconscious. He is found by Father Everett, who unmasks him to see that it is Matthew Murdock, a blind lawyer. Matt's mind then goes back to how he got his powers.</p><p>An unknown time ago, young Matt was growing up with his father, a boxer named Jack \"The Devil\" Murdock. Jack frequently made Matt promise that he would study hard, and not end up a loser like him. A few days later, Matt is walking home from school along the docks, when he sees his father attacking someone. Out of fear, Matt runs away, but has radioactive waste sprayed into his eye when a forklift accidentally opens a barrel. Matt wakes up in hospital some time later, blind, but with his remaining senses superhumanly sharp. His father and him make a silent promise to each other to never give up.</p><p>Matt's father regrets this promise later, as he is supposed to purposely lose a fight, but doesn't for Matt's sake. As a result of this, Matt's father is murdered.</p><p>Going forwards about ten years later, Matt is a lawyer alongside his colleague Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson. In court, he uses his super hearing to tell that a man is guilty, but cannot prove it. As a result, the criminal goes free, but Matt decides to stop him. That night, he gets into his Daredevil costume and tracks down the man to a bar. After he defeats everyone else in the bar, he chases the man to a subway station, and pushes the man onto the tracks, where he is run over by a subway. The next day, the police find the body, and a reporter named Ben Urich tries to convince them it was Daredevil's work, but the police don't believe him.</p><p>That same day, Foggy and Matt are in a cafe, where Matt notices a young woman. He follows her out of the cafe, insisting that she should give him her name, but she refuses. The two have a fight in a playground, where neither are able to gain an advantage over the other, which is a first for both of them. Eventually the woman tells Matt that her name is Elektra Natchios. Elektra is the daughter of Nikolas Natchios, a billionaire, who is secretly working for the Kingpin of crime. Nikolas tells the Kingpin (Wilson Fisk) that he is going to stop crime, but after he does so, Wilson makes plans to frame him as being the Kingpin.</p><p>Shortly afterwards, the assassin Bullseye manages to kill Nikolas Natchios, and makes it look as if Daredevil is the murderer. Elektra swears revenge on Daredevil, which leads to her and Daredevil fighting. Elektra manages to badly wound and unmask Daredevil, and realises that he didn't kill her father. Just after Elektra unmasks Daredevil, she is attacked and killed by Bullseye. Daredevil escapes to a church, where the movie began, but is followed by Bullseye. The two fight until Daredevil manages to get a police sniper to shoot Bullseye's hands. Daredevil then throws Bullseye to the ground from the top of the church.</p><p>Daredevil then goes to Wilson Fisk, as Bullseye mentioned that he was the real Kingpin. Daredevil and Kingpin fight, and for a moment it seems as if Kingpin has won, but then Daredevil smashes a window, bringing rain in which makes it easier for Matt to fight in. With the advantage, Kingpin is soon defeated.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Overview</h2><p>Batman Forever was the third entry in the Burton/Schumacher Batman Films. In it Batman and Robin have to stop Two-Face and The Riddler from destroying Gotham City. The film was Joel Schumacher's first Batman film. The film was also Val Kilmer's debut as Batman, he only played Batman in one film due to him already starting on another movie by the time Batman and Robin was going into pre-production.</p><h2>Plot</h2><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"459608\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/459608-batmanforevertitle_super.jpg\" title=\"Title Screen\"><img id=\"459608\" src=\"http://media.screened.com/uploads/1/14483/459608-batmanforevertitle_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Title Screen\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Title Screen</div></div></div></div><p>Batman Forever begins with a robbery and hostage situation by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/two-face/29-5555/\">Two-Face</a> (Harvey Dent, former District Attorney and friend to Bruce Wayne. A gangster threw acid at him and he was able to cover half his face, leaving only half of it scarred. He was driven mad and developed the need to make all his decisions based on the flip of a coin. Heads for good, tails for evil). After a fight with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>, Two-Face escapes. Soon after we are introduced to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/riddler/29-3718/\">Edward Nygma</a>, a mad scientist of sorts employed at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wayne-enterprises/65-51471/\">Wayne Enterprises</a>. He approaches Bruce Wayne and with his machine that can beam television straight into a person\u2019s brain. rejects the invention on the notion that in the wrong hands the technology could have malicious applications. This sends Nygma over the edge; he kills his supervisor and makes it appear a suicide and resigns from his post due to grief over his death.</p><p>Soon after this Bruce Wayne meets psychiatrist Chase Meridan (although Batman met her previously at the Two-Face hostage incident). Bruce invites her to a charity event held at a circus. Two-Face coincidentally crashes the event in an attempt to force the high-ranking elite to surrender Batman\u2019s secret identity, else he will blow up the circus. He kills the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/flying-graysons/65-55863/\">Flying Graysons</a> (an acrobat-family in the circus) while making his demands. <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robin/29-1687/\">Dick Grayson</a> (the youngest) survives and even removes the explosive device, then returns to find his parents dead. Bruce takes Dick in and lets him stay at <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wayne-manor/34-55767/\">Wayne Manor</a> as long as he wants. Dick, however says he is not interested, but is dissuaded by Bruce and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alfred/29-5556/\">Alfred</a>. He then declares that he is going to kill Two-Face and get revenge on the killer of his family, and when he accidentally discovers Bruce in the Batcave he wants to become Batman\u2019s partner.</p><p>Edward has come to blame Bruce for rejecting his invention and becomes obsessed with making him pay. He begins leaving unsigned riddles for Bruce and becomes a criminal calling himself \u201cThe Riddler\u201d. He locates Two-Face and persuades him to become allies. Edward realizes he can use his invention to read minds and also literally the IQ of anyone who uses it. It is unknown exactly how this works, as it does not make the victim less intelligent, only Nygma moreso. Two-Face and Riddler begin a string of robberies, their goal being the mass production of Edward\u2019s device. During a party for the success of his device on the market, Riddler reads Bruce Wayne\u2019s mind and finds he has \u2018bats on the brain.\u2019 He deduces is Batman moments before Two-Face crashes and robs the party. Two-Face nearly kills Batman, but Dick arrives in the nick of time to save him. Two-Face and Riddler assault the Manor soon after. Riddler destroys most of the equipment in the Batcave, while Two-Face flips his coin to decide whether he can shoot Bruce. It comes up saying no, and Two-Face flips again and again until it finally says yes and he shoots Bruce, but not fatally. The two villains then proceed to kidnap Dr. Chase. Before he leaves, however, Riddler leaves Bruce one last riddle. Bruce and Alfred later solve the riddles, finding they are all together a number/alphabet riddle which spells \u201cMr. E\u201d a pun on \u201cmystery\u201d which is a synonym for \u201cenigma\u201d. Bruce realizes that enigma can also be read \u201cE. Nygma\u201d as in Edward Nygma.</p><p>After this, Batman and the newly christened Robin attack Riddler\u2019s island-base. They avoid his sea mines, evil frogmen and anti-aircraft beam and approach the Riddler\u2019s hideout. The two are separated upon reaching the island. Robin finds himself facing Two-Face and defeats him. Two-Face falls over a ledge and holds on barely, pleading for his life. Robin searches himself and finds he cannot kill Two-Face, then helps him up. Two-Face takes his advantage and captures Robin with his pistol. Batman, meanwhile, makes his way to the inner part of the lair and finds the Riddler himself. Riddler then reveals Robin and Dr. Chase, both tied, gagged and caged, and offers Batman the chance to save one of them by letting the other die. Riddler is trying to destroy Batman by proving he cannot be both Bruce Wayne and Batman. Batman asks Riddler a fairly simple riddle, the answer to which is \u2018bat\u2019, and buys himself enough time to draw a Sonar <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batarang/18-46297/\">Batarang</a> and destroy the core of the system connecting all of Riddler\u2019s machines, which is also connected directly to Riddler\u2019s brain. The backlash of the machine drives Riddler instantly insane, however he manages to drop Chase and Robin into a pit filled with water and sharp metal. Batman manages to rescue both and swings them onto a ledge in the middle of the pit. Two-Face then appears and flips his coin, hoping to kill all three of htem. Batman throws several coins up to confuse Two-Face, who cannot keep track of his own coin and loses his balance. He falls to his death at the bottom of the pit. The insane Riddler is packed off to <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arkham-asylum/34-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a> and Chase consults on his case. Riddler offers to reveal Batman\u2019s identity to her, but then begins raving madly that <i>he</i> is Batman. Bruce meets Chase outside and she informs him that Nygma is in no position to tell anyone Bruce is Batman. The end of the movie shows Batman <i>and</i> Robin running off to another crime.</p>",

        "description":"<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>The movie starts off with Batman and Robin plumetting into action, trying to stop Mr. Freeze from stealing a very large diamond. A battle ensues, with Batman and Robin pitted against Mr. Freeze and his henchmen at a museum. The Bat-Duo fails to stop Mr. Freeze when Robin gets ahead of himself and ends up getting frozen by Mr. Freeze, allowing him to escape while Batman tries to thaw Robin.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dr. Pamela Isley, a botanist, discovers that her boss, Dr. Woodrue, is using her venoms to create a criminal called Bane. He kills her for discovering this secret; however, she survives the poisons that are intoxicating her and kills Woodrue after she reawakens.</p><p>Back at the Batcave, Batman and Robin are doing research on Mr. Freeze. Alfred has begun to show signs of fatigue, apparently due to his old age. The next day, Alfred\u2019s niece, Barbara Wilson, drops by on a surprise visit. The day after that, Bruce unveils a new powerful telescope for which he has donated the funds. This is where Pamela Isley forces her way up to ask Bruce for funding, which he rejects. Later, Bruce decides to conduct a diamond auction in an attempt to lure Mr. Freeze into a trap. However, Poison Ivy comes in and mesmerizes everyone with her spores. Mr. Freeze comes in to steal the diamond, and with Poison Ivy there already, it distracts Batman and Robin from capturing Mr. Freeze. However, the duo go after him anyway. Batman disables Robin\u2019s bike from jumping a bridge. Batman jumps the bridge himself and is able to land on Mr. Freeze and arrest him. Back at the Batcave, Robin gets into an argument about trust with Batman.</p><p>While Dick is doing some research in the Batcave, he catches Barbara sneaking out with a motorcycle and decides to follow her this time. He follows her to an underground motorcycle race, and participates himself. But he ends up saving Barbara from falling off the bridge when the biker gang trips her. Back at the mansion, Barbara reveals to Dick that she wants to take Alfred away from his life of servitude. Bruce then reveals to Dick that Alfred is dying.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Arkham Asylum, Poison Ivy breaks in to free Mr. Freeze in order for them to team up. Dick then alerts Bruce that Mr. Freeze has escaped, and the Bat-Duo rushes over to Mr. Freeze\u2019s former hideout. Batman and Robin go deeper into Mr. Freeze\u2019s hideout, where they encounter Bane and Poison Ivy. The Bat-Duo ends up fighting each other instead, giving Ivy and Bane enough time to escape. When Ivy returns to her own hideout, she tells Mr. Freeze that Batman killed his wife, when in fact it was Ivy who did it. Back at the mansion, the doctor reveals that Alfred has stage 1 of MacGreggor\u2019s syndrome, which is the same stage to which Freeze already has the cure. Later, after Alfred gives Barbara a CD containing secrets and telling her to give it to Alfred\u2019s brother, Barbara tries to hack into it to see what it is. She is eventually successful and discovers the secrets about Batman and Robin.</p><p>Later that night, Bruce is finally able to convince Dick to trust him before he goes to see Poison Ivy. Meanwhile, Mr. Freeze plans to take over the telescope that Bruce Wayne had donated in order to freeze the entire city. Barbara eventually finds her way down to the Batcave, where Alfred has already tailored a Batcostume for her. Robin goes to meet Poison Ivy, who tries to poison him by kissing him. However, Robin has trusted Batman, and he had a rubber cover over his lips. Batman drops in to help him but all the vines tangle them up. Eventually, Batgirl comes and rescues the Bat-Duo.</p><p>Afterwards, the three of them rush over to try and stop Mr. Freeze. All three of them eventually fight their way to Mr. Freeze, whose plan they foil. They are able to thaw the city by using the satellites to reflect the sun towards the city. Batman also succeeds in obtaining a cure for Alfred from Mr. Freeze, and afterwards they use it on Alfred. The next morning Alfred awakens and seems to be healthy again. The film ends with Poison Ivy hallucinating inside her cell in Arkham Asylum.</p>",
