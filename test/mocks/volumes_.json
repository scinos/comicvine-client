        "description":"<p>Superman launched May 18, 1939 with its first issue (that doesn't actually have a #1 on the cover) and although it was a seasonal book for its first five issues, with its sixth it began a bimonthly publishing rate and kept up with said rate until its eighty-fifth. With its eighty-sixth issue Superman began it's mostly consistent monthly publishing rate which it continued using up until 1986 when the series ended at 423 issues, the last issue featuring <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/alan-moore/26-40382/\">Alan Moore</a>'s acclaimed story \"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\" After that, the title's numbering was continued through Adventures of Superman which lasted for several decades. It was in 2006 with #650 that the title returned to its original name, kicking off it's new era with the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/one-year-later/39-40777/\">One Year Later</a> storyline co-written by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/geoff-johns/26-40439/\">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kurt-busiek/26-41741/\">Kurt Busiek</a>. After the arc, the series was written by Busiek from 654-675, with <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/james-robinson/26-42389/\">James Robinson</a> taking the reigns in 677 and holding them tight until the milestone 700th issue where <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-michael-straczynski/26-40683/\">JMS</a> took over with an arc entitled \"<a href=\"/grounded/39-56189/\">Grounded</a>\" that would feature Superman walking across America. However, JMS left the book earlier then planned and new writer <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/chris-roberson/26-19991/\">Chris Roberson</a> worked off of JMS' original notes and plotline. Unfortunately, Roberson never got to prove himself with his own story on the book as with the launch of The New 52 in September 2011, after 72 years and 714 issues (including Adventures of Superman) Superman Vol. 1 came to an end with the final chapter of the Grounded story arc serving as the final issue of the series. Superman will survive as an ongoing series at DC, with the month following the release of Superman #714 serving as the launching point of the third ongoing <a href=\"/superman/49-42986/\">Superman</a> series in DC history with #1.</p><h4>For Post <a href=\"/flashpoint/39-56280/\">Flashpoint</a> volume 3, refer to <a href=\"/superman/49-42986/\">Superman</a>.</h4><p>General Notes</p><p>Superman #424-649 do not exist, however, the issues that took those numbers can be found on the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/adventures-of-superman/49-3778/\">Adventures of Superman</a> page.</p><p>Another ongoing title from DC entitled Superman does exist and was published with its own numbering while Adventures of Superman was in print, thus even though this title began publication in the 30's and lasted until 2011, no two Superman titles were hitting shelves at the same time.

        "description":"<p>The entire run of Batman still stands upon large controversies over who actually came up with some of the characters. <a href=\"/bob-kane/26-19137/\">Bob Kane</a> supposedly came up with the idea for the hero, but it has been suggested that he only came up with a \"Bird-man\" and <a href=\"/bill-finger/26-43591/\">Bill Finger</a> suggested he be a \"Bat-man\". Both creators however, share credit for this character. As for the <a href=\"/joker/29-1702/\">Joker</a>, the first concept sketch was drawn by <a href=\"/jerry-robinson/26-9680/\">Jerry Robinson</a>, but Kane disputed that his input was \"minimal\" suggesting he and Bill came up with the idea. Kane also finagled many legal aspects of Batman related print and media. Every movie and comic reads \"Batman created by Bob Kane\" when it should read \"Batman created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger\". However It is not disputed that Robinson and Finger came up with the character, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Robin</a> after \"Robinhood\" . Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff co-created numerous bat-creations including <a href=\"/alfred/29-5556/\">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, <a href=\"/poison-ivy/29-1697/\">Poison Ivy,</a> <a href=\"/mr-freeze/29-3715/\">Mr. Freeze</a>, <a href=\"/batwoman/29-9052/\">Batwoman</a>, <a href=\"/batgirl/49-7205/\">Batgirl</a> as well as <a href=\"/bat-mite/29-23170/\">Bat-Mite</a> and <a href=\"/ace-the-bat-hound/29-31302/\">Ace the Bat Hound</a> just to name a few. <a href=\"/bill-finger/26-43591/\">Bill Finger</a> also co-created <a href=\"/penguin/29-4885/\">Penguin</a>, <a href=\"/riddler/29-3718/\">Riddler</a>, and <a href=\"/catwoman/29-1698/\">Catwoman</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1681131\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/1681131-batman1ad_super.jpg\" title=\"Ad for Batman #1\"><img id=\"1681131\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/1681131-batman1ad_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ad for Batman #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ad for Batman #1</div></div></div></div><p>One of DC's longest running books showcasing the adventures of the Dark Knight, <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>. Through out the years, a majority of Batman's marquee story lines have happened within the pages of this book including, but not limited to the death of the second Robin, <a href=\"/jason-todd/29-6849/\">Jason Todd</a>, and <a href=\"/bane/29-6129/\">Bane</a> breaking Batman's back, leading to <a href=\"/jean-paul-valley/29-12834/\">Jean-Paul Valley</a> to assume the role of Batman for a period of time in the 90s.</p><p>In 2006, super-star writer <a href=\"/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> took over the book. Morrison wrote stories that introduced readers to Bruce's son <a href=\"/damian-wayne/29-42413/\">Damian Wayne</a> as well as putting Bruce through a series of near fatal trials against <a href=\"/black-glove/65-54825/\">The Black Glove</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-hurt/29-54826/\">Doctor Hurt</a>, leading up to the epic 2008 story lines of <a href=\"/batman-rip/39-55116/\">Batman RIP</a> and <a href=\"/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a> where Bruce Wayne had apparently died at the hands of the evil god <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>.</p><p>After Bruce's \"death,\" and the <a href=\"/battle-for-the-cowl/39-55808/\">Battle for the Cowl</a>, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Dick Grayson</a>, the first Robin, took up the mantle of Batman, continuing to protect Gotham exactly as his mentor had. He even took in Damian as his own Robin. With the exception of two issues set prior to the events of <a href=\"/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a>, Dick Grayson has been the star of the book since issue #687.</p><p>When the super hero community learned that Bruce Wayne had never actually died, and was sent back in time by Darkseid, Dick Grayson eventually knew that his time as Batman would soon end. But with Bruce's return, and formation of <a href=\"/batman-inc/65-57839/\">Batman Incorporated</a>, Bruce deemed Dick Grayson the Batman of Gotham City, as he traveled the world, searching for more recruits for his new organization.</p><p><a href=\"/charles-paris/26-38494/\">Charles Paris</a> has drawn the most issues of Batman thus far at 128. <a href=\"/dennis-oneil/26-40861/\">Denny O'Neil</a> is a long time writer and editor at DC with 211 issues. He also contributed the location of <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/34-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a> as well as the characters <a href=\"/man-bat/29-6131/\">Man-Bat</a>, <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra's al Ghul</a> and <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/29-4917/\">Talia al Ghul</a>.</p><p>In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched their entire line in an event known as \"<a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">The New 52</a>\" which would see the premiere of fifty-two new titles, thus the long-running Batman series ended with #713 during <a href=\"/tony-daniel/26-4663/\">Tony S. Daniel</a>'s run on the title. In the new line, however, Tony Daniel will continue writing in the \"Batman universe\" but under the character's other main title, <a href=\"/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a>.

Like Jumbo, this title was also an anthology, but all the stories revolved around a common science fiction theme. Although it's predecessor lasted for many more issues, Planet Comics was published at a bimonthly rate for most of its run meaning it too ended in 1953 with its 73rd issue. Planet Comics serves as one of the best examples of \"<a href=\"/good-girl-art/12-45911/\">Good Girl Art</a>\", a movement commonly associated with the Golden Age of Comics in which gorgeous women would often be posed to show off their beauty, which many of the covers show. However, Planet also had stories featuring women as the sole heroine such as <a href=\"/mysta-of-the-moon/29-1321/\">Mysta of the Moon</a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"/gale-allen/29-1315/\">Gale Allen</a>. Other popular stories included \"The Space Rangers\" (which merged the Flint Baker and Reef Ryan strips), \"Star Pirate\", \"Mars, God of War\", \"The Red Comet\" and \"The Lost World\" (featuring Hunt Bowman, this was the lead feature for a large part of the book's run).",

In 1940, he got his own ongoing series kicking off with \"The Human Torch Comics #2\", the elusive first issue actually being <a href=\"/red-raven-comics/49-19964/\">Red Raven Comics</a> #1. More confusion would stem from the fact that #4 (the third issue) read #3 on the cover and there was no cover with a 4 since there were actually two issues labeled #5. Following the early mix-ups with issue numbering however the series began a proper numbering with #6 (which <i>was</i> actually the sixth issue, rather then the 5th which it would have been had the original numbering been kept). The comic went on to last for 38 issues but due to the fact that the first 29 were published at a quarterly rate, it was only in 1954 that the final issue came out.",

The original line-up was all superheroes with \"<a href=\"/magno/29-4110/\">Magno</a> (and <a href=\"/davey/29-61258/\">Davey</a>)\", \"<a href=\"/lash-lightning/29-34148/\">Lash Lightning</a>\", \"<a href=\"/vulcan/29-18744/\">Vulcan</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/raven/29-6537/\">The Raven</a>\". With the fourth issue, Vulcan was switched out for <a href=\"/soldier-unknown/29-61008/\">Unknown Soldier</a> (predates the DC character of the same name) and in the following issue The Raven was replaced by <a href=\"/captain-courageous/29-18821/\">Captain Courageous</a>. The Flag took Captain Courageous' spot in the next issue, but with #7 Capt. Courageous returned and the line-up remained consistent up until the 21st issue when Unknown Soldier was replaced by an unrelated character called \"<a href=\"/the-unknown/29-76050/\">The Unknown</a>\". In #24, Lightning was replaced with <a href=\"/hap-hazard/29-75788/\">Hap Hazard</a> by which point the comic no longer retained a consistent genre and expanded into several. With #26, the last of the original features was cut and the line-up from that point on changed every issue until it settled on four characters for the last three issues but superheroes were no longer featured in the publication and when the series ended in 1947, it was a teen humor publication. Two issues followed #32, under different titles: #33 was called <a href=\"/crime-must-pay-the-penalty/49-40505/\">Crime Must Pay the Penalty</a> (which became its own long-running series) and #34 was titled <a href=\"/four-teeners/49-32020/\">Four Teeners</a>.</p>",

The series told the adventures of young Billy Batson, who by speaking the magic word \"SHAZAM!\" would receive super powers. Trouble was, these powers were kind of similar to those attributed to the Man of Steel. Depite the fact that Captain Marvel's stories tended to have a lighter and more humourous element to them, DC was not impressed. After a protracted plagiarism lawsuit, which DC eventually won, Cap and the rest of the Marvel Family disappeared from the comic world for about 20 years. Funnily enough, they would re-appear at DC.</p>",

As World War II was going on at the time, he would of course occasionally defeat Nazis although he would also stop regular criminals. After holding onto the title for twenty issues (and four years), with #34, Margie became the feature and with #35 the series changed its name to reflect this, becoming <a href=\"/margie-comics/49-1113/\">Margie Comics</a>.</p>",

The strip was intended to excite kids about life in the military, hopefully leading them to later seek a place in the US Armed Forces. Fawcett's comic lasted up until 1948 when it ceased publication after sixty-four issues. The book would later see two brief revivals before it ended; the first was in 1951 when Fawcett briefly resurrected the series for five more issues, the second came in 1955 when Charlton printed reprints of the series but this only lasted for four issues and after that the title's compiled numbering was continued in the Charlton series, <a href=\"/fightin-navy/49-36532/\">Fightin' Navy</a>.</p><p><b>Publishers</b></p><ul><li>#01-69: <a href=\"/fawcett-publications/57-34/\">Fawcett Publications</a></li><li>#70-73: <a href=\"/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton</a></li></ul>",

To minimize risk, DC licensed an established property - the Gang Busters radio program, which had been on the air waves since 1935 (originally under the name of the G-Men). Edited by Jack Schiff, the Gang Busters comic focused on FBI cases and stand alone crime stories. The first issue included tales such as \"Murder was my business\" and \"The case of the Iron-clad alibi.\" Later issues featured photo covers, a practice becoming increasingly common in the late 1940's.</p>",

Mr District Attorney came along at the right time to catch a wave of crime comics and lasted for 67 issues.</p>",

        "description":"<p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-colt/29-7238/\">Kid Colt</a> was a Western comic book character dating back to 1948, where he made his first appearance in the comic series <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-colt-hero-of-the-west/49-1198/\">Kid Colt: Hero of the West</a>. However, aforementioned series didn't last too long, at least not under its original title as it changed the name of the comic after issue four (although the covers had already begun the name change with issue three). This new title was, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kid-colt-outlaw/49-1199/\">Kid Colt: Outlaw</a> which is what it continued to be three full decades until the series finally came to a close after a two hundred and twenty-nine issue run. That makes Kid Colt the longest-running cowboy star in an American published comic-book , featured in stories for a 31-year stretch from 1948-1979, though from 1966 most of the published stories were reprints.</p>",
