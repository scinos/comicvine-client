One team remains on Earth while the other two journey to the respective throneworlds of the Shi'ar and Kree to find some way of protecting Earth from this war.

Its detonation ends the war, killing millions upon millions of Kree.</p><p>The Avengers survive and discover the true architect of all this death is the Supreme Intelligence, who sacrificed countless lives so that the few surviving Kree would break free of their evolutionary dead end thanks to the Nega-Bomb's fallout.

        "description":"<p>One night Batman goes to visit the Joker in Arkham Asylum. While contemplating the futility of their relationship, and that it will only result in either his or the Joker's death in the future, he discovers that the Joker sitting before him is not actually the Joker, but an impostor. Batman threatens the imposter, and asks his infamous question \"Where is he?!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the Joker is looking to buy a run-down old theme park for then unknown reasons. Through flashbacks, Moore reveals parts of the Joker's past, and shows he had a significant other named Jeannie who was pregnant with his child. Joker kills the owner of the theme park with his <a href=\"/joker-venom/12-50669/\">joker venom</a> (the same one that made him the way he is) and makes the land his own. Later, Barbara Gordon answers the door only to find the Joker on the other side. The Joker shoots Barbara and takes nude photos of her on the floor and bleeding. His goons abduct Commissioner Gordon. In another flashback we see that the Joker was a failed comedian who, out of desperation for the life of his unborn baby, joins the mob for one job and becomes the Red Hood. Barbara is later revealed to be paralyses from the waist down. Batman consoles Barbara, and she tells him that this time its different. \"The look in his eyes\" she utters, while crying.</p><p>Commissioner Gordon is stripped naked and sent through an insane carnival ride, bombarded with the nude images of his daughter in an attempt to to break his sanity. He is ridiculed and made fun off by the Joker, to an audience of carnival freaks. Another flash back shows that before the Joker could even begin the job, Jeannie had died. Distraught, he has doubts about the job, but gets bullied into going through with it anyway. When Batman ruins the job, the Joker (while trying to escape) accidentally falls into a river of chemical waste and after removing his red helmet/hood, he sees what he has become. It becomes evident that he is insane, as he is shown laughing with blood dripping from his eyes and mouth. Back in the present, after gathering clues, Batman finds his way to the carnival and proceeds to fight the Joker and free Gordon. He tries to comfort Gordon, but is told to continue in the pursuit of the Joker, and to \"bring him in by the books\". The Joker attempts to shoot Batman with what would seem to be the same gun he used to cripple Barbara Gordon. The gun turns out to be a fake and Batman lives. The Joker tells an unusual joke about two insane men, and as he laughs uncontrollably, Batman utters a solitary chuckle. The story ends as it starts pouring rain and the police show up.</p><p>Some time later, she decides to become the omniscient computer presence known as the <a href=\"/oracle/29-5368/\">Oracle</a>. She ends up being more useful and dangerous as the Oracle than <a href=\"/batgirl/29-1701/\">Batgirl</a>.</p><p>The Killing Joke has gained notoriety due to its labeling as a graphic novel, despite it's short length.</p><p>Tim Burton stated \"I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and The Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan - and I think it started when I was a child - is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was dyslexia or whatever, but that's why I loved <i>The Killing Joke</i>, because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.\" He has stated in the past that The Killing Joke was his inspiration for his Batman movie. There is however speculation as to whether or not this is a legitimate claim as Tim Burton's depiction of the Joker was much different to the one portrayed in the Killing Joke.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/across-the-universe-the-dc-universe-stories-of-alan-moore-dc-universe-the-stories-of-alan-moore/37-150020/\">Across the Universe: The DC Universe Stories of Alan Moore Vol. 2</a></li></ul>",

        "description":"<h2>Plot Summary</h2><p>When the Sentry came from another dimension to that of Earth-2149, he carried an infection with him. This infection was a zombie plague, and when the Avengers of Earth-2149 arrived at the scene of the Sentry's arrival, he infected them all. Soon the Avengers would spread the plague to other heroes, and before long the entire world became either infected or devoured.</p><p>Before long though, the Marvel Zombies ran out of food. While some of the zombies such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Wolverine, gained the powers of Galactus, others stayed behind and used cloning technologies to continue eating. Years later, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and the others came back to Earth to find that Black Panther had survived and created a new life for the survivors of the plague, but it wouldn't be long until the hunger took over, and the zombies' plague spread.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Dead Days</h3><p>A strange lightning in the sky struck New York. There it shows a zombified Sentry infecting the Avengers. The Avengers then went around eating the citizens and infecting other heroes/villains. All remaining heroes retreat to the S.H.I.E.L.D hellicarrier to plan for an attack on the zombies. Tony Stark and Reed Richards plan for a way to solve the problem but Reed goes mad and infects the Fantastic Four having the hellicarrier become infected. Stark makes a dimensional teleporter and has the remaining heroes escort it away while he gets infected. Nick Fury then decides to destroy the teleporter so the zombies will be stuck in this universe.</p><p>It didn't take long for the zombies to eat most of the population. The zombied heroes are still hungry, so they manipulate Reed Richards from the ultimate universe to build the dimensional teleporter that Stark created. The teleporter was made but was then destroyed by Magneto to once again prevent the zombies from infecting the ultimate universe.</p><h3>Marvel zombies 1</h3><p>Magneto destroyed the teleporter and is on the run trying to return to his base on asteroid M. Unfortunately he was found by zombie heroes and fought. Magneto put up a great fight but was defeated and eaten by zombie Captain America (now called colonel america), Spider-Man, Hulk, Thor, Luke Cage, Hank Pym, Wasp, Wolverine, and Daredevil. After that they are discussing how the biology of being a zombie works which they can't figure out.They then see the Silver Surfer but disappears quickly. The group then reunites with Zombie Iron man who is angry about the group eating magneto without him. meanwhile zombie Hank Pym sneaks into a secret lab where he has a sedated Black Panther who Hank uses as a secret meal. He then amputates his leg for a meal until zombie Wasp finds Hank and asks him to split Black Panther with her. Hank then kills Wasp by biting her head off but spits it out because of bad taste. Meanwhile the group encounter the Silver Surfer again. Silver Surfer tells the zombies Galactus is coming to devour the planet but the zombie's respond by attacking him. The surfer puts up good fight by destroying Iron man's legs and burning Hulk's face. Unfortunately The Silver Surfer is defeated by the Hulk by biting his head off. So Colonel America, Spider-man, Wolverine, Hank Pym, Iron man, and Luke Cage eat the Silver Surfer and gain the surfers cosmic powers. They then show off their powers by destroying almost every other zombie. Meanwhile, Black Panther (missing an arm and a leg) escaped the lab with Wasp (now only a head) to find a group of mutants who are searching for Magneto. At first they reject T'Challa because he has zombie Wasp but later accept him and they escape to Asteroid M where Black Panther was able to get a prosthetic arm and leg from Forge. Back on Earth, Galactus has reached Earth and easily overpowers the cosmic zombies. The zombies then retreat to Hank Pym's secret lab to build a cannon that can destroy Galactus. They then fuel it with their cosmic powers and knocks Galactus unconscious. They then see a group of zombie villains going to try to eat Galactus but is easily defeated except Colonel America who was killed by zombie Red Skull. The cosmic zombies then go and eat Galactus gaining his powers. It is then shown years later and Asteroid M landed on earth. Black Panter and Wasp (now with a robotic body) find earth not inhabited by anything so they start to rebuild. Meanwhile we see a alien planet being attacked by the zombies who are now dressed like Galactus.</p><h3>Marvel zombies 2</h3><p>Many years later the cosmic zombies (Spider-man, Wolverine, Iron man, Luke Cage, Hank Pym, Hulk) and a couple new zombies (Phoenix, Thanos, Gladiator, Firelord) ate everything in the known universe.Thanos blamed Hulk for biting more than he can chew which resulted in Hulk killing Thanos. Hank then remembered the dimensional teleporter that they can rebuild and use to find more food. So the zombies began their journey to earth. Meanwhile on earth. Black Panther (now an old man) is leader of New Wakanda and is learning that they don't have enough people to sustain a population and fears extinction, also they found the head of zombie Hawkeye who's still alive but can't remember much after being buried for so many years. Also there's a mutant resistance group that is planning to assassinate Black Panther. So that night, and assassin came and stabbed Panther in the gut fatally wounding him. Zombie Wasp comes in and incapacitates the assassin. She then sees the only way of keeping Panther alive is by turning him into a zombie. So she bites him but doing this has returned her hunger and tries to eat Black Panther's wife but Panther (now a zombie) stops her and tells her to help him eat the assassin. Panther and Wasp then go into a reinforced safe to get over the hunger. Later, Black Panther and Wasp are cured of the hunger and leave only to find the leader of the resistance group <a href=\"/malcolm-cortez/29-48899/\">Malcolm Cortez</a> rant about Panther becoming a zombie roweling up the crowd. Then the other zombies appear. Hank Pym shocked by there being some humans left suggest making a breeding program so they can eat humans forever. In an anger, Spider-man shoots the top of hank's head. Spider-man tells them they used to be heroes and they should learn to get over the hunger because Spider-man and Luke Cage already got over it. In response the rest of the zombies attack Spider-man and Luke cage. Black Panther and wasp came to assist until the people put up force field keeping the zombies out except Gladiator. Spider-man, Luke cage, Black Panther, and wasp then fought Gladiator. Gladiator was proven stronger than them combined. Forge then came wearing a new and improved Iron man armor and holds down Gladiator for Spider-man and Luke Cage to blast Gladiator's head off. The zombies outside the barrier then left to look for the teleporter. The good zombies then went into the city to get prosthetic limbs. Meanwhile the zombies finally reached Earth and head to Stark industries to look for the teleporter but are attacked by the buildings security which made Stark believe someone already came here and took the teleporter. Later, Forge showed the good zombies the teleporter and told them they better prepare for the other zombie's return. Also forge also helped even the battle by revealing Black Panther's son who has a chunk of Captain America's brain inside.The bad zombies returned and the good zombies fought them but they eventually got into the city. Hank Pym was about to eat a person until the hunger vanished in him. Hank then saw all the horrible things he did and told the other zombies to stop. The Hulk then tried eating people and all the zombies fought Hulk but Hulk killed Phoenix, Firelord, hawkeye, and Iron man. Then a man came and sacrificed himself to the hulk causing hulk to turn into banner where the zombies killed him. After all this they plan to use the teleporter to teleport the remaining humans to a different dimension until Malcolm came and teleported the zombies away making Malcolm leader of New Wakanda.</p><p>Checklist</p><p>(Chronological)</p><ul><li><p>Marvel Zombies: Dead Days</p></li><li><p>Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness, issues 1-5</p></li><li><p>Ultimate Fantastic Four, issues 21-23 (Original Appearance)</p></li><li><p>Marvel Zombies, issues 1-5</p></li><li><p>Ultimate Fantastic Four, issues 30-32</p></li><li><p>Black Panther, issues 28-30</p></li><li><p>Marvel Zombies 2, issues 1-5</p></li></ul><p>Trivia</p><p>Zombie Wolverine also appears in <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/exiles/19986/\">Exiles</a> 85 and 86.</p><h2>Collected Editions</h2><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies/49-19252/\">Marvel Zombies</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-dead-days/49-32703/\">Marvel Zombies: Dead Days</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-vs-army-of-darkness/49-30903/\">Marvel Zombies Vs Army of Darkness</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-2/49-32704/\">Marvel Zombies 2</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-return/49-27709/\">Marvel Zombies Return</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther-four-the-hard-way/49-30150/\">Black Panther: Four the Hard Way</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-3/49-32872/\">Marvel Zombies 3</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-4/49-32986/\">Marvel Zombies 4</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/marvel-zombies-5/49-36370/\">Marvel Zombies 5</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-supreme/49-39236/\">Marvel Zombies Supreme</a></li><li><a href=\"/marvel-zombies-evil-evolution/49-29427/\">Marvel Zombies: Evil Evolution</a></li><li>Marvel Zombies: The Covers</li></ul><h2>Related Issues</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-official-handbook-of-the-marvel-universe-the-official-handbook-of-the-marvel-universe-alternate-universes-2005/37-106689/\">The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe #17</a></li></ul>",

This doesn't sit well with some heroes and the Super-Hero community is divides into sides: <a href=\"/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>'s Pro-Registration Act team enforced by SHIELD and its new director <a href=\"/maria-hill/29-40824/\">Maria Hill</a>, and Captain America's Anti-Registration Act team called the <a href=\"/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a>. This separation causes a super-human Civil War that pits the two teams against each other physically and morally.</p><p>The Civil War has many consequences including the separation of the <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a> and the <a href=\"/fantastic-four/65-3804/\">Fantastic Four</a>, the revelation of <a href=\"/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man's</a> secret identity to the world, the departure of the <a href=\"/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> to France, the death of <a href=\"/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a> and finally the death of <a href=\"/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a> himself at the end of the War.</p><h2>Full Plot</h2><h3>Whose Side Are You On?</h3><p><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Tony Stark</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Peter Parker</a> go to Washington D.C. to try to refute the Super-human Registration Act. Peter is to act as Tony's eyes and ears. However, things go awry and an assassination is plotted against Tony by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/titanium-man/13823/\">Titanium Man</a>. However, it is later revealed to the reader that Iron-Man (Tony Starks) planned the assassination in order to show the need for a Super-human Registration Act. When <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/1442/\">Captain America</a> is approached by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/3775/\">SHIELD</a> to see if he could neutralize all of those against the Super-Human Registration Act, he refuses and has to run out after they try to shoot him down. Captain America is denounced as a criminal by the President, and he is ambushed by S.H.I.E.L.D, yet still escapes.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/new-warriors/65-11896/\">New Warriors</a>, a group of mutants with their own TV show, trying to get higher ratings ambush <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nitro/3160/\">Nitro</a>, <a href=\"/coldheart/29-26244/\">Coldheart</a>, <a href=\"/cobalt-man/29-3286/\">Cobalt Man</a>, and <a href=\"/speedfreek/29-25735/\">Speedfreek</a>. But Nitro, powers amplified by <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mutant-growth-hormone/12-42280/\">Mutant Growth Hormone</a>, sets off an explosion, killing around 600-1200 people, at least 60 confirmed to be children. Of the super-human individuals involved in the incident only <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/robbie-baldwin/29-2104/\">Robbie Baldwin</a> and Nitro survived. Speedball was rocketed from the incident, hanging on to life, and Nitro jumped into the back of a passing pickup truck and fled the scene. This horrific event rushes the Super-human Registration Act, and within a week it gets passed. Although it is not necessary for a superhuman to give away his secret identity to the public, he or she is required to register with SHIELD, giving away all personal information. In return, SHIELD will provide some sort of safe-haven, pay heroes a salary, and they will be scheduled holiday breaks. This is seen as a slap in the face to a large portion of heroes, being forced to choose between become a federal employee, or stop fighting crime. Others, such as Iron Man, see this just as an evolution of Super-humans' roles in society. As a sort of reward for his support of the act, Stark gives Spider-Man an new \"Iron Spider\" suit that will enhance Spider-Man's abilities with technology similar to Stark's own Iron man outfit.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"80016\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war_super.jpg\" title=\"I am Peter Parker.\"><img id=\"80016\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/533/80016-158709-civil-war_medium.jpg\" alt=\"I am Peter Parker.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">I am Peter Parker.</div></div></div></div><p>In a move that would shock the world, Spider-Man would demonstrate his support for both Iron-Man and the bill by coming out publicly in support of the Bill as Peter Parker and Spider-Man. In a shocking conclusion to the secret identity that Peter spent his entire adult life protecting he pulls off his mask in a news conference, saying \"I'm Peter Parker, and I've been Spider-Man since I was 15 years old. Any Questions?\" It is in this instant that Peter's life will change forever. Friends and enemies are hurt and shocked by the deception. Now knowing that his most hated enemy and one of his most faithful employees are one in the same <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/j-jonah-jameson/29-1487/\">J. Jonah Jameson</a> fires Parker and begins contemplating legal action he can take against Peter for fraud. Also enraged by the perceived betrayal, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-octopus/29-1485/\">Doctor Octopus</a> attacks Peter outside of the high school at which he teaches. Other former villains also begin to launch attacks on Peter and those closest to him, making him realize one of the greatest fears he had of losing his secret identity. In order to protect those he loves <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mary-jane/29-13380/\">Mary Jane</a> and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/aunt-may/29-1780/\">Aunt May</a> are moved into <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stark-tower/34-40830/\">Stark Tower</a> where they can receive 24 hour protection and monitoring.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the U.S. government is constructing a secret facility that will come to be known as the Negative Zone prison. Designated Facility 42, it is located in the Negative Zone, and will be accessible at first through a portal controlled by Stark, <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, and S.H.I.E.L.D. The prison was designed by Tony Stark, Reed Richards, and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a> with the intention of housing superpowered individuals that did not comply with the Superhuman Registration Act. Meant for security, there are facilities for neutralizing and restraining individuals with just about any power imaginable.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"108529\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108529-20367-civil-war_super.PNG\" title=\"Cyborg Thor kills Goliath\"><img id=\"108529\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108529-20367-civil-war_medium.PNG\" alt=\"Cyborg Thor kills Goliath\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Cyborg Thor kills Goliath</div></div></div></div><p>As many current and former superheroes and villains begin signing up for the registration act an underground resistance movement begins to grow. Other superheroes begin to band together with Captain America against the act including <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak/29-1474/\">Cloak</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagger/29-1935/\">Dagger</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a> and many others. The growing friction escalates until the first major battle between Iron Man's registration act support and Cap's \" <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a>\". This battle involves all of the heroes associated with either side of the conflict, and comes to a climax with the unveiling of a cyborg version of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thor/29-2268/\">Thor</a> (presumed to be the actual Thor at the time) as being in support of the Registration Act. The appearance of Thor surprises both sides of the conflict, as few knew of his existence before this point. The clone is much more violent than the real Thor and kills Bill Foster with a lightning blast through the chest. Horrified at what has happened, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> creates a force field around the battered remainder of the resistance allowing Cloak to teleport the team to safety. After the battle Thor is revealed to be a cyborg rather than the original that was made by Iron Man and Reed Richards and that his violent behavior was an unintentional glitch in their work. This event move begins shaking the resolve of some pro-registration heroes such as Spider-Man and the Invisible Woman and causing anti-registration heroes Nighthawk and Stature to switch sides.</p><p>After the death of Bill Foster, the Civil War now spills into the personal lives of Susan Storm and Reed Richards and threatens their marriage by disagreement over the course of action which Reed and Tony have carelessly embarked upon. Offended and hurt when Reed says that he is doing what he is to protect Sue, she erects a cylindrical forcefield that comes crashing through the center of all 35 floors of the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/baxter-building/34-41454/\">Baxter Building</a> and asks Reed if she looks like she needs protection. Unable to come to an agreement, Susan and <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a> leave the Baxter building under the cover of night to join Captain America's underground resistance to the act. The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a> also finds himself increasingly torn by the direction of the Civil War. He is watching those he loves and respects fight and take sides against each other. On one hand he is against the Superhuman Registration Act because he does not believe in what it stands for. On the other hand he believes himself to be a patriot, and as such does not believe that it is proper for him to be fighting his own government.</p><p>At this point the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thunderbolts/65-23977/\">Thunderbolts</a> have already began a recruitment drive, attacking and capturing other former villains for the government to train and employ as a means to capture more of the renegade super-heroes and super-villians. The Super-Human Restraint Unit, a sub-division of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/shield/3775/\">SHIELD</a> also starts to neutralize mutants who still display their powers (e.g., stop crime) without registering with SHIELD. Individuals such as <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/prodigy/40475/\">Prodigy</a> even get taken down by Iron Man himself.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192246\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192246-ff538010_col_super.jpg\" title=\"The Thing leaves\"><img id=\"1192246\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192246-ff538010_col_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Thing leaves\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Thing leaves</div></div></div></div><p>While transporting captured heroes to the containment facility Spider-Man finds himself uneasy when Iron Man asks him to remain at the head of the caravan of vehicles because of his ability to sense danger. Since he has never disclosed his Spider-Sense to Stark, Stark may have found out about his ability by using the suit to monitor him. A battle erupts when the Secret Avengers meet the caravan to release the captured members of the resistance. Using info from the Yancy Street Gang the anti-registration group tries to free captured heroes. Going after Captain America himself, Spider-Man finds himself in a fight he may not win. The two eventually stop fighting because Spider-Man cannot bring Captain America in himself even if he does win. Meanwhile, the Thing has been unintentionally drawn into the battle despite the Things insistence on remaining neutral. Both sides of the conflict mistake his intervention as acting on their behalf. After the battle the Thing angrily states that he cannot take any more of the fighting, and will be leaving for France. The government puts a hold on all of his finances and closely monitors him. Despite the unwanted attention, Ben Grim makes his way to France away from the conflict.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192208\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192208-svsi_super.jpg\" title=\"Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man\"><img id=\"1192208\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192208-svsi_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Line 11-Peter v.s Tony Spider-man v.s Iron-man</div></div></div></div><p>Possibly because he trusted Peter more (or possibly to watch him turn) Tony Stark takes Peter Parker on a tour of the Negative Zone prison so that Peter can finally see more of the inner workings of the act. Peter's faith in the act had been shaky ever since first agreeing to assist Tony, however it is finally broken as he sees the inhuman conditions in which former allies and enemies are to be kept in the negative zone for their civil disobedience. Occupants are locked up in their cells, and many will never leave because of the escape threat they pose. Some are fully restrained to the point they cannot move their bodies at all and others yet are put in virtual reality goggles to immerse them in a fake world to pacify them. Before leaving Tony leaves Peter alone with Reed briefly. Unbeknownst to Peter, Tony is monitoring their entire conversation (presumably using the bugs designed into Peters suit) where Peter questions a nearly broken Reed Richards about what they have found themselves in. When he gets back to Stark Tower Peter rushes Aunt May and Mary Jane to grab what they can and flee Tony Stark's grasp. Tony crashes in through the wall of the building and begins a fight with Peter that would flow into the streets of New York. Tony incapacitates Peter with a fail-safe he built into Peter's suit. Peter is able to gain the upper hand by reversing the fail-safe (Peter being quite adept with computer technology had already secretly discovered the secret code in his new suit and hacked Tony's programming). Peter flees into the sewer and Stark unleashes several of Spider-Man's enemies in the Thunderbolts into the sewers to capture Peter.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"107586\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war_super.jpg\" title=\"Punisher saved my life.\"><img id=\"107586\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/107586-132386-civil-war_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Punisher saved my life.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Punisher saved my life.</div></div></div></div><p>Captured and beaten nearly to death, Peter is saved in the nick of time by the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a> who shoots and kills his attackers. Carrying Peter over his shoulder, the Punisher breaks into Captain America's secret hideout to get Peter medical attention. The Punisher did not have much patience for costumed superheroes before the Civil War, and probably would not have become involved had it not been for Stark's alliance with the Thunderbolts allowing costumed villains to become government sponsored bounty hunters. Captain America disagrees with Castle's involvement because of his track record, yet tentatively allows him to remain with the group. His tenure with the Secret Avengers is cut short when a pair of costumed villains come to the Secret Avengers hideout with offer of truce to join the cause. Castle automatically shoots and kills them in cold blood causing Captain America to give the Punisher a severe beating. Castle would not fight back due to his respect for Captain America (who as it turns out also played a role in training Castle's army regiment), and simply takes the attack.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1192256\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192256-hulkling_reveal_super.jpg\" title=\"Hulkling Disguise\"><img id=\"1192256\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64148/1192256-hulkling_reveal_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Hulkling Disguise\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Hulkling Disguise</div></div></div></div><p>Knowing that one of the members of the resistance is actually a double agent for Stark (specifically it is <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tigra/29-21188/\">Tigra</a> that is double-crossing them), Captain America plans the most massive assault yet on the Registration Act. The plan is to infiltrate the Negative Zone prison and catch Stark off guard. What Tony does not know is that the morning of the attack Captain America sends <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulkling/29-2259/\">Hulkling</a> disguised as Hank Pym to incapacitate Pym and take his place. As one of the key members of Stark's group, Pym has full access to everything about the Negative Zone Prison. Teddy, disguised as Pym, infiltrates the Prison and releases all of the anti-registration heroes and villains that had been captured until this point. Tony along with the registered heroes attempts to head off the Secret Avengers only to discover that the fixed fight that he had prepared in order to put an end to the resistance was now evenly matched. Attempting to stop the fight from leaving the prison, prison officials attempt to close down the portals to the Positive Zone, stranding everyone in the Negative Zone until things are resolved and the Secret Avengers are captured. Not allowing this to happen, Cloak uses everything he has to teleport all of the heroes and villains involved in the conflict through the portal into the middle of the skies of New York.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"108526\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war_super.jpg\" title=\"The last and final battle.\"><img id=\"108526\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/462/108526-84993-civil-war_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The last and final battle.\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The last and final battle.</div></div></div></div><p>Raining down from the skies, flying heroes are instructed to assist non-fliers to the ground regardless of their affiliation. Once mobile, both groups begin fighting again, and inadvertently begin destroying everything around them. At the climax of the battle Iron Man has Captain America in his sights, and is ready to take him out of the battle. As instructed by Captain America, the <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/young-avengers/65-40426/\">Young Avengers</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a> phases into Iron Man's armor and partially solidifies to take his weapons out of the equation. Caught off guard and with his heavy armor effectively useless, Captain America is able to gain the upper hand against Iron Man. Pummeling him with his fists and his shield, Captain America raises his shield over the smashed helmet of Iron Man. Looking through the pieces of his broken armor up at Captain America he simply challenges \"Do it.\" Before Captain America is able to bring his shield down upon Tony's face he is tackled by nearby government workers: police, firemen, and other emergency personnel. At first struggling against them, Steve Rogers stops and drops down. The battle around him begins to stop almost immediately. Rogers is horrified by the realization that he was no longer fighting for the people that he was sworn to protect. Looking at the carnage around him and seeing for the first time the true cost to everyone involved (civilian and super power alike), Captain America surrenders and tells his team to stand down. For better or for worse, Steve Rogers has single handedly ended the Civil War. While some heroes including Captain America are taken into custody following the final battle of the War, many escape including some key members of the Secret Avengers.</p><h3>Involvement in the Civil War</h3><p>While sides were changed during the war, this is a tally of the main characters and teams involved on either side of the Civil War at the end and the official stance they took on registration</p><p><b>Pro-Registration Characters:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-man/29-1455/\">Iron Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hank-pym/29-2247/\">Hank Pym</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr. Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/she-hulk/29-1449/\">She-Hulk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Ms. Marvel</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/sentry/29-1454/\">Sentry</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wonder-man/29-1465/\">Wonder Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tigra/29-21188/\">Tigra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/stature/29-40516/\">Stature</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bishop/29-1503/\">Bishop</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doc-samson/29-4315/\">Doc Samson</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-widow/29-3200/\">Black Widow</a>, <a href=\"/ragnarok/29-47573/\">Thor clone</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wasp/29-1502/\">Wasp</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/henry-gyrich/29-9711/\">Henry Gyrich</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/valerie-cooper/29-14860/\">Val Cooper</a>, Venom</p><p><b>Pro-Registration Teams:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/great-lakes-initiative/65-23989/\">Great Lakes Initiative</a></p><p><b>Anti-Registration Characters:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/captain-america/29-1442/\">Captain America</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-man/29-1443/\">Spider-Man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/goliath/29-3470/\">Goliath</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/iron-fist/29-1492/\">Iron Fist</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hercules/29-2503/\">Hercules</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/black-panther/29-1477/\">Black Panther</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/storm/29-1444/\">Storm</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/spider-woman/29-1453/\">Spider-Woman</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/human-torch/29-2120/\">Human Torch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/luke-cage/29-1450/\">Luke Cage</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cloak/29-1474/\">Cloak</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/dagger/29-1935/\">Dagger</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/hulkling/29-2259/\">Hulkling</a>, Wiccan, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/arachne/29-16197/\">Arachne</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/punisher/29-1525/\">Punisher</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/falcon/29-1451/\">Falcon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/typeface/29-40637/\">Typeface</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vision/29-1504/\">Vision</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/madrox/29-7910/\">Madrox</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cable/29-2157/\">Cable</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/nick-fury/29-3202/\">Nick Fury</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/jessica-jones/29-2265/\">Jessica Jones</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/namor/29-1476/\">Namor</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/patriot/29-2258/\">Patriot</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/bucky-barnes/29-40470/\">Bucky Barnes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/kate-bishop/29-2262/\">Kate Bishop</a></p><p><b>Anti-Registration Teams:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/secret-avengers/65-40904/\">Secret Avengers</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-factor/65-24131/\">X-Factor</a></p><p><b>Neutral Characters:</b> The <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/thing/29-2114/\">Thing</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/doctor-strange/29-1456/\">Doctor Strange</a>, <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/firestar/29-2101/\">Firestar</a>, Deadpool</p><p><b>Neutral Teams:</b> <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a></p><h3>Casualties of War</h3><p>A list of those that died during the course of the Civil War.

Registration is required of all Mutants and other Super-Powered individuals. Anyone without powers that wishes to don a costume to fight crime is also required to register. Individuals that accept and register will effectively become government S.H.I.E.L.D.. Agents and will be trained by S.H.I.E.L.D. and are required to work for the government on government salary. Amnesty for past actions is also offered as an incentive to registrants. Parallels can be drawn between the Super-human Registration act and the Mutant Registration Act.</p><p>See: <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/super-human-registration-act/12-40639/\">Super-Human
