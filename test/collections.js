Garth had hoped to make some money to look for his brother, but quit the team soon after due to McCauley's lack of morals. Despite aiding the Legion against Daxamite terrorists, Garth was still not allowed to rejoin, so he went off again to find his brother. When he found Mekt, his mind had snapped, and he was a deadly criminal. Mekt abducted Garth and shot his right arm off.

When Cosmic Boy disappeared after the Dominators attempted to take over Earth, a public election was held for Legion leadership. <a href=\"/supergirl/29-2351/\">Supergirl</a> was elected with Lightning Lad her deputy. She soon left for the 21st century and Garth became the team leader. Garth was quickly overwhelmed with the responsibilities of leadership, especially dealing with the various organizations of the United Planets. This put a strain in he and Saturn Girl's relationship which led her to have a psychic affair.

The Legion founders went to the <a href=\"/batcave/34-31340/\">Batcave</a> to find proof that <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> was actually a Kryptonian and not an Earthling like Earth-Man was leading the people to believe, but Garth and the others were captured.

They succeeded in saving the rocket and keeping he timeline intact. During the battle, Garth's right arm was apparently destroyed off-panel.

Live Wire wasn't comfortable with the idea and shortly thereafter hosted a leadership election for a replacement. Once the team was reunited, he began a relationship with Saturn Girl and ultimately proposed. Garth and Imra were one of several Legionnaires lost in a spatial rift. Saturn Girl's manipulation of the team put a strain on their relationship.

Bruce falls into a well and into a cave, where he is attacked by a horde of bats. His dad eventually gets him out and takes him into the house, and then Bruce awakens from the dream. He is a young adult in a foreign prison, where he fights criminals one by one. Eventually Bruce meets a man named Henri Ducard, who offers him a chance to join the League of Shadows as long as he gathers a rare flower. Bruce succeeds and climbs the mountain up to Henri Ducard. After he arrives, he meets <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra\u2019s al Ghul</a> and tells Ducard about how his parent</p><p>died and the guilt and anger that he carries. Ducard begins training Bruce the way of the ninja. During the training, Bruce tells Ducard about the reason he did not avenge his parents during the trial of Joe Chill (killer of the Waynes and also the same killer in the comics), and then how he became a criminal in order to learn how they think, which is how Bruce ended up in prison in the first place. Bruce completes his final test; however, he has to execute a criminal in order to become a full member. But Bruce does not want to become an executioner. He instead flings a hot brand onto the explosives, detonating them all. Bruce fights Ra\u2019s Al Ghul until the roof collapses onto the latter. Bruce then saves Ducard from falling off the cliff, then he returns to Gotham via private jet with Alfred. Back in Gotham, Bruce discovers a huge cave underneath the mansion. Later, Bruce shows up at Wayne Enterprises, surprising all the executives because Bruce had been declared dead years ago.</p><p>Bruce asks for a job at the applied sciences department. Heading over there, he discovers the vast amount of technology there. He meets Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) and gets a tour. Bruce asks to \u201cborrow\u201d the suit for cave diving. He then continues working on the cave, installing lights and then discovering more areas in the cave. Bruce then began ordering parts from dummy corporations to build himself a Bat costume. Later that night, Bruce goes out with the armor and a ski mask. He sneaks up on Officer James Gordon, and tells him about the plan to put criminals behind bars. He tells him to look for his sign.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2128354\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128354-batmanbeginsprofpic_super.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2128354\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128354-batmanbeginsprofpic_medium.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>Bruce eventually gets all the equipment needed to make his Bat Suit and on his first night out on patrol he encounters Carmine Falcone and his goons exporting /importing drugs with a crooked cop. Once he takes care of all Falcone's men he goes after Falcone after asking who he is he simply says \"I'm Batman.\" Afterward Gordon arrives seeing Falcone's men, but doesn't think anything of it because there is no connection to Falcone. However he learns that Falcone is on the grounds tied up to a Flood light and when Gordon looks out to see how it shines we get our first crude Bat Signal.</p><p>After Bruce''s first night out on the job, Alfred notices the bruises and advises Bruce to get an alibi for all his injuries, he suggests Polo. Dr. Crane goes to see Falcone in prison, who wants to be transferred to Arkham. We learn that Crane is working for someone and shows <a href=\"/carmine-falcone/29-42288/\">Falcone</a> the scarecrow mask. Bruce goes out to insure his Public identity as Bruce Wayne, coming across as a spoiled playboy, buying a hotel after his dates start swimming in a pool. He later goes on Patrol and finds Crane's hideout, however he is affected by the fear gas and has to flee, calling Alfred for help.</p><p>Days go by and eventually Bruce recovers, Alfred tells him Lucius Fox helped supply an antidote for the weaponized hallucinogen. Bruce asks Fox to make some more. Rachel stops by and drops off his birthday present before having to go to the Narrows to talk to Crane. Bruce rushes to his cave telling Alfred to entertain his guests until he returns.</p><p>At Arkham when Rachel asks too many questions Crane is forced to give a concentrated dose of his fear Toxin. Batman arrives and having been immunized against the toxin, uses it on Crane, who talks. He says Ra's Al Ghul is the person behind everything, including adding the toxin to the water supply. Before Batman can get anything more out of him the police arrive. The cops want to wait for SWAT but Gordon goes in anyway. Batman grabs him explaining the situation and asks him to take her and meet him out back. Once there Batman takes her to the Bat Cave, although making some additions to the nightly news on the way. When he releases Rachel from the Toxin he gives her a sedative and goes upstairs to the party. Alfred tells him he needs to be careful and not show off to which Bruce replies Rachel is downstairs, take her home. As Bruce enters the party he goes to Fox, who tells him he was just fired, but Bruce wants him back at Wayne Enterprises to make more Vaccines for the Toxin. As Bruce tries to make his way around the party he is introduced to Ra's Al Ghul, who he believes to be dead, however it turns out that Ra's is actually Ducard. Ra's tells him to either get the people out of the house or he will make a scene. Bruce takes this time to become \"drunk\" and tells his guests to get the hell out. As the guest leave Bruce sees all the Assassins in the room. Ra's tells him his plans of destroying Gotham and wants Bruce to join him. He also learns that this isn't the first time Gotham has been targeted for destruction. Bruce tells him Gotham isn't beyond saving. Ra's gives the order to his men to start burning his house, as Ra's tells him he never minded his surroundings as a beam falls on Bruce. \"You burned my house and left me for dead. Consider us even.\" As Wayne Manor is burning Alfred returns and finds Bruce helping him down to the cave.</p><p>Bruce is distraught, everything his father built is burning because of him. Alfred sees that Bruce is bleeding but tells him \"Why do we fall, Sir? So we can learn to pick ourselves back up.\" A line his father told him when he was little. As Bruce heads out to save Gotham, Rachel goes to the Narrows to give Gordon his anti-Toxin. As the bridges close and the gas released Gordon is the only one left and calls for back-up. Commissioner Loeb tells him there is no one left, as Batman, in the <a href=\"../../batmobile/18-41463/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batmobile</a> jumps the gap. He has Gordon go to Wayne Tower to try to Blow up the tracks as he goes to fight Ra's. Along the way, he saves Rachel, who asks who he is. He responds \"It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.\" Something she told Bruce Wayne earlier and realizes who Batman really is. As Bruce begins to fight Ra's on the train, Ra's believes he's trying to stop the train, but instead he insures that the train doesn't stop. As Gordon blows up the tracks he tells Ra's he never did mind his own surroundings. Ra's believes Bruce is going to kill him to which he replies \"I won't kill you, but I don't have to save you.\" As he leaves Ra's on the train as it crashes.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"2128359\"><div class=\"wiki-img-center\"><div class=\"wiki-img-super\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128359-batman_begins_1_1_.jpg\" title=\"\"><img id=\"2128359\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/10/100264/2128359-batman_begins_1_1__super.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\"></div></div></div></div><p>The following day Bruce hires Fox as CEO and fires the previous one. Heading back to Wayne Manor he talks to Rachel who tells him, if one day Gotham doesn't need Batman she will be there waiting for him. When asked what he will do with the Manor he replies \"Rebuild it, Brick by Brick\" exactly the way it was. Alfred tells him they could do something in the southeast corner, referring to the <a href=\"../../batcave/34-31340/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat-cave</a>.</p><p>Jim Gordon has been promoted and signals Batman with a <a href=\"../../bat-signal/18-55819/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bat Signal</a>, joking that he couldn't find any mob bosses. He then questions about the escalation that is going to happen because of Batman. He gives Batman a case. Double Homicide and leaves a calling card. It is revealed to be a Joker card. Batman says he'll look into it. Gordon says he never got to thank him, to which Batman replies \"and You'll never have to.\" Batman jumps off the building and circles around as the movie ends.</p><h3>Comic Book Adaptations</h3><p>1) <a href=\"/batman-begins-the-movie-and-other-tales-of-the-dark-knight/49-31294/\">Batman Begins: The Movie and Other Tales of the Dark Knight</a></p><p>2) <a href=\"/batman-begins-official-movie-adaptation/49-44587/\">Batman Begins: Official Movie Adaptation</a></p>");

DC was formed by the merging of National Allied Publications and Detective Comics. The Company changed it's name as a result of its nickname: DC Comics. People had nicknamed it DC because of one its most popular comic series; <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a> It is perhaps the world's most recognizable comic companies and rivals <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> publishing.</p><p>DC Comics has its official headquarters at 1700 Broadway, 7th, New York, New York. Random House distributes DC Comics' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comics Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1837076\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58424/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large_super.jpg\" title=\"Justice League # 1\"><img id=\"1837076\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/5/58424/1837076-dc_comics_reinvents_pg564mg_x_large_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Justice League # 1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Justice League # 1</div></div></div></div><p>National Allied Publications' first comic was <i>New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1</i> which was released in the February of 1935. It hit off, and was surprisingly popular. Later that year, a second title was released: <i>New Comics #1.</i> The size and length <i>New Comics #1</i> became the archetype for many comics afterwards, and it became the longest running comic series of all time.</p><p>With the establishment of DC as the major comic book company and with many of the most marketable names in the early years of comics, it became the main company that other companies tried to compete with. Companies tried different approaches, for instance <a href=\"/fawcett-publications/57-34/\">Fawcett Publications</a> tried to copy the formula of <a href=\"/superman/29-1807/\">Superman</a> and to have an all-powerful hero with a supporting \"family\", whereas other companies such as <a href=\"/charlton/57-125/\">Charlton Comics</a> created entire new worlds. Further along in the <a href=\"/silver-age-of-comics/12-55821/\">Silver Age</a> many of these companies failed and either DC or Marvel bought the rights to the characters. Thus although they had once been competitors the properties of Fawcett and Charlton both eventually came under DC's control.</p><p>With the reinvigoration of Marvel in the 1960s under the leadership of <a href=\"/stan-lee/26-40467/\">Stan Lee</a> and <a href=\"/jack-kirby/26-5614/\">Jack Kirby</a>, DC found itself a new and more potent competitor. Marvel succeeded by breaking what had become by then generic archetypes of superheroes by introducing characters which were younger and more flawed (and thus appeared more human and appealed to a younger crowd in a more direct manner.) After falling behind Marvel in sales, DC was finally forced to adopt much of the same system which Marvel had, by introducing such young teams as the <a href=\"/teen-titans/65-19081/\">Teen Titans</a> to compete with the <a href=\"/x-men/65-3173/\">X-Men</a>.</p><p>With the same concept in mind, in 2011, DC announced they were cancelling all the main titles and starting over with all <a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">New 52's</a> as part of a relaunch. In charge of the relaunch is <a href=\"/geoff-johns/26-40439/\">Geoff Johns</a> and <a href=\"/jim-lee/26-2399/\">Jim Lee</a>. The relaunch started with the release of <a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/justice-league-justice-league-part-one/37-290431/\">Justice League # 1</a> on August 31st. this was done partially to revitalize the company and to deage the characters and thus make them more dynamic. On January 12, 2012, it was announced that there would be a second wave of the new 52 where six titles would be getting canceled with another six to replace them, though the plan to stay at 52 ongoing monthlies seems to be consistent.</p><p>DC comics now has 28 live action movies, 16 animated films (in all likely hood more), 42 television series's and 39 video games based on the DC universe. <b>DC Imprints and Sub-Imprints Both Past and Present</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/vertigo/57-521/\">Vertigo</a> (1993-Present)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/wildstorm/57-708/\">WildStorm</a> (1999-2010)*</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cmx/57-2345/\">CMX</a> (2004-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/helix/57-602/\">Helix</a> (1996-1998)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/2000ad/57-2358/\">2000AD</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/americas-best-comics/57-731/\">America's Best Comics</a> (1999-2010)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/cliffhanger/57-2287/\">Cliffhanger</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/tangent-comics/57-638/\">Tangent Comics</a> (1997-2008)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/paradox-press/57-1982/\">Paradox Press</a> (1993-2001)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/piranha-press/57-2083/\">Piranha Press</a> (1989-1994)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/humanoids/57-1346/\">Humanoids</a> (2004)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/milestone/57-538/\">Milestone</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/impact/57-483/\">Impact!</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/minx/57-2227/\">Minx</a> (2007-2008)</li><li><a href=\"/zuda-comics/57-2069/\">Zuda</a> (2007-2010)</li></ul><p>*the imprint was founded in 1992 but as part of the <a href=\"/image/57-513/\">Image</a> conglomerate and only moved to DC in 1999</p><h2>DC Movies (Cinematic Releases)</h2><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-the-movie/223-55/\">Batman: The Movie</a> (July 30, 1966)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman/223-2/\">Superman</a> (December 15, 1978)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-ii/223-5/\">Superman II</a> (June 19, 1981)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-iii/223-6/\">Superman III</a> (June 17, 1983)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/supergirl/223-171/\">Supergirl</a> (November 21, 1984)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-iv-the-quest-for-peace/223-9/\">Superman IV: The Quest For Peace</a> (July 24, 1987)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman/223-4/\">Batman</a> (June 23, 1989)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-returns/223-7/\">Batman Returns</a> (June 19, 1992)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-forever/223-8/\">Batman Forever</a> (June 16, 1995)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-robin/223-10/\">Batman &amp; Robin</a> (June 20, 1997)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/league-of-extraordinary-gentlemen/223-28/\">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> (June 11, 2003)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/constantine/223-26/\">Constantine</a> (February 18, 2005)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/batman-begins/223-12/\">Batman Begins</a> (June 14, 2005)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/superman-returns/223-11/\">Superman Returns</a> (June 28, 2006)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-knight/223-15/\">The Dark Knight</a> (July 18, 2008)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/watchmen/223-1/\">Watchmen</a> (March 19, 2009)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/green-lantern/223-926/\">Green Lantern</a> (June 17, 2011)</li><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/the-dark-knight-rises/223-1214/\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> (July 20, 2012)</li></ul><h4>Coming Attractions (Cinematic Releases)</h4><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.comicvine.com/man-of-steel/223-1375/\">Man of Steel</a> (June 14, 2013)</li></ul>");

Mimic sought out the X-Men in an attempt to make his powers permanent, but was defeated and became an ally for a short time.

Stan Lee created the title 'X-Men' when publisher <a href=\"../../martin-goodman/26-43801/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Martin Goodman</a> turned down the original name ' The Merry Mutants' because he felt that people would not understand what a mutant actually was. Throughout the Marvel Universe, it is believed that the X-Men were named after Professor Xavier, their mentor but it is claimed that they were actually named after the X-Gene, the gene that created mutants.</p><p>One of the reasons for creating X-Men was the amount of mail Marvel was getting from the readers demanding a new superhero team because of all the solitary heroes in Marvel roster. Stan Lee wanted the heroes to have similar origin background, and because \"I could not get everyone bitten by radioactive spider\", Lee came up with the \"Homo Superior\" concept.</p><p>Some have pointed out that it is possible that the team was inspired by <a href=\"/dc-comics/57-10/\">DC Comics</a>' Doom Patrol. At the time <a href=\"/marvel/57-31/\">Marvel</a> was a new force on the comics scene and took a lot of its motivation and inspiration from DC (for instance the Fantastic Four were patterned after the <a href=\"/challengers-of-the-unknown/65-16341/\">Challengers of the Unknown</a>). The similarities between numerous characters, and especially Professor X to <a href=\"/the-chief/29-35126/\">the Chief</a> have led to this speculation.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h3>The Early Years</h3><p>The Silver and early Bronze ages of comics published stories more in line with the standard at the time, meaning issues that consisted of self contained stories with little overall development of characters. One of the developments of Marvel is that the company became much more interested in character development, but this change was slow and the early years of the X-Men were marred with the same problems as other comics, if perhaps to a lesser degree.</p><h3>Late 70's</h3><h3>Deadly Genesis/Giant-sized X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"13286\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men_super.jpg\" title=\"All New All Different\"><img id=\"13286\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/0/4/13286-2763-14890-1-giant-size-x-men_medium.jpg\" alt=\"All New All Different\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">All New All Different</div></div></div></div><p>The first big shake-up for the team came when the original team (plus Havok and Polaris, minus Beast) were abducted by the living island of Krakoa. First Professor X sent a brand new team of untried students trained by <a href=\"/moira-mactaggert/29-8304/\">Moira MacTaggert</a>. This team included Kid Vulcan, Darwin, Sway,and Petra, but they were quickly overtaken by the island. Petra and Sway were killed but Vulcan was left in suspended animation (partially due to Darwin's powers). When Krakoa released Cyclops to bring more mutants to feed on, Professor X gathered several young mutants who already had experience in their powers: Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Thunderbird, Sunfire, and Banshee. Due to Professors X's mental manipulations, Vulcan's team was completely forgotten and Storm's team became known as the X-Men second generation. Following this mission, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Angel, Havok, and Lorna Dane (as well as Sunfire) all left the team allowing the remaining new members and Cyclops to become the new X-Men.</p><h3>New X-Men</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833613\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Phoenix Rises\"><img id=\"1833613\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833613-387606_100958_jean_grey_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Phoenix Rises\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Phoenix Rises</div></div></div></div><p>The\nnewly formed team was comprised of diverse but strong personalities, making\nthem very different from the original team. The\nnew team consisted of adults rather than impressionable teenagers, and both Scott and\nXavier found it challenging to get the team to work together. On their second mission, the team battled Count Nefaria, and despite earlier warnings, Thunderbird had sacrificed himself for his teammates, and became the first X-Man to die in the line of duty. Subsequent missions had also put the new team against former X-Men members such as Havok and Lorna Dane (now going by the name of Polaris), who were under the influence of Shi\u2019ar agent Eric the Red, and Kierrok and his N\u2019gari. It was during these early periods that readers got their first glimpses of Moira MacTaggert, <a href=\"/black-tom-cassidy/29-4568/\">Black Tom Cassidy</a>, and <a href=\"/lilandra/29-6144/\">Lilandra</a>.</p><p>During a Christmas trip to New York City, the X-Men and Marvel Girl were attacked by <a href=\"/sentinels/65-4296/\">Sentinels</a>, which led to the capture of Jean, Banshee and Wolverine. The remaining X-Men were dispatched to space to save the Starcore space station and their teammates. The team was attacked by Erik the Red, and robot duplicates of the original team along with Havok and Polaris. On the escape back to Earth, the spaceship was badly damaged and could not be piloted through use of auto pilot. After telepathically absorbing the information necessary to pilot\nthe ship from Dr. Peter Corbeau, Marvel Girl volunteered to fly the ship back\nto Earth. She assumed that by creating a psionic shield of telekinetic energy she would be safe, and simultaneously forced Cyclops to sleep as she flew the ship back to Earth. Unfortunately, her body could not handle the strain and she perished. The ship landed in the Hudson Bay with all the X-Men safe, but they could not find Jean. While searching for Jean, she emerged from the river in a completely different costume and a fiery voice, and declared a new identity as the Phoenix. The team was uneasy but grateful that Jean had survived, but they quickly noticed that her powers were much more than they were before. She easily performs feats that she was never able to as Marvel Girl.</p><h3>Phoenix Saga</h3><p>Immediately after, the team (except Scott and Charles who were looking after Jean) battled the <a href=\"/juggernaut/29-1445/\">Juggernaut</a> and Black Tom Cassidy in Ireland, but before they were defeated, Jean as the Phoenix saved them. The team then faced foes such as Magneto, which saw the division among the team, and each side thought that the other had perished; Moses Magnum, who held Japan hostage and cost Banshee his mutant power; Proteus, the reality warping son of Moira MacTaggart who was killed by the soft hearted Colossus. There was also a mission in the Shi\u2019ar galaxy to defeat the mad Emperor D\u2019Ken.

He initiated \"time slips\" to convince her that she was living in the past as his lover. Jean goes to the club and became fully entranced under Masterminds mind control. The X-Men attempted to intervene, but it only led to their capture with the exception of Wolverine, who makes a famous stand against the club's security and Inner Circle. Jean eventually overpowered Mastermind, and through the powers of the Phoenix, she put his mind in touch with the universe, which essentially overwhelmed his mind into catatonia. Her actions had caused her to become overwhelmed by her own powers, thus transforming her into the Dark Phoenix.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833617\"><div class=\"wiki-img-left\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833617-831402_dofp_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Wolverine and Katherine\"><img id=\"1833617\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833617-831402_dofp_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Wolverine and Katherine\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Wolverine and Katherine</div></div></div></div><p>After defeating the X-Men and heading to space where she destroyed a star system, Dark Phoenix returned to Earth. The X-Men had allied with the newly deputized <a href=\"/avengers/65-3806/\">Avengers</a>, and Beast confronts Jean in an attempt to calm and help her. The teams are quickly defeated, but Professor X, aided with the help of Jean Grey, defeated the Phoenix persona. Once he won, the X-Men were interrupted by Lilandra and the Shi'ar imperial guard. As empress, Lilandra is bound by Shi'ar laws to kill the Phoenix for the crimes she had committed against their empire, which was the \"eating\" of a star, and condemning a planetary system in death. The team is transported to the Blue Area of the Moon and Xavier reads Lilandra's mind and invokes Arin'n Haelar, a duel of honor that cannot be denied. The X-Men face off against the Imperial Guard of the Shi'ar. Once the X-Men are defeated, Jean lost control of her powers and personality, and the Dark Phoenix persona arises. Before Lilandra could order the destruction of the solar system to prevent Phoenix from becoming a threat again, Professor X instructed the X-Men to subdue Jean. Once she regained her senses, Jean used a Kree weapon to commit suicide.</p><h3>Days of Future Past</h3><p>With the death of Jean Grey, Cyclops left the team and Angel returned. Professor X promoted Storm to team leader and they welcomed Kitty Pride, now codenamed Sprite, onto the team. In an attempt to deter an assassination plot on <a href=\"/robert-kelly/29-15026/\">Senator Kelly</a> by Mystique's Brotherhood of Mutants, Kitty's psyche had switched with that of an alternate time line. In that time line, the world is ruled by Sentinels, and mutants were sent to internment camps and killed. Most of the known X-Men at the time had perished with the exception of Colossus, Storm, Wolverine and Magneto. They were joined with the son of <a href=\"/invisible-woman/29-2190/\">Invisible Woman</a> and <a href=\"/mr-fantastic/29-2151/\">Mr Fantastic</a>, <a href=\"/franklin-richards/29-2469/\">Franklin Richards</a>, and the daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey, <a href=\"/rachel-summers/29-3566/\">Rachel Summers</a>. In order to prevent the apocalyptic future, Kitty traveled back to the past to prevent the death of Senator Kelly. She is successful, however, the alternate time line that she had encountered remained intact.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833618\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833618-663504_1_super_super.jpg\" title=\"The Brood\"><img id=\"1833618\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833618-663504_1_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"The Brood\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">The Brood</div></div></div></div><p>The next few months are tumultuous for the X-Men.

The X-Men, along with house guest <a href=\"/ms-marvel/29-21561/\">Carol Danvers</a>, traveled to space with the Starjammers and were kidnapped by Lilandra\u2019s sister <a href=\"/deathbird/29-6089/\">Deathbird</a> and the terrifying <a href=\"/brood/65-4987/\">Brood</a>. This lead to Danvers being transformed into the cosmically powered Binary and the X-Men almost being transformed into Brood creatures themselves. The X-Men returned to Earth to destroy the Brood embryo inside Professor X and discover that in their absence, the Professor has gathered a new group of young mutants, the New Mutants. Kitty was briefly demoted to the junior team until she proved herself against a Sidri Hunter on her own.</p><h3><b>Morlocks</b></h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1833621\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super_super.jpg\" title=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\"><img id=\"1833621\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/7/79967/1833621-79291_114501_morlocks_super_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Callisto and the Morlocks\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Callisto and the Morlocks</div></div></div></div><p>The X-Men discovered that Angel had been kidnapped by a community of underground dwelling mutants calling themselves <a href=\"/morlocks/65-3191/\">Morlocks</a> and led by a fierce woman named <a href=\"/callisto/29-3423/\">Callisto</a>. In a duel to the death, Storm fought Callisto for Angel\u2019s life and the leadership of the Morlocks.

She isn't accepted into the team right away and must prove herself by saving Lady <a href=\"/mariko-yashida/29-3196/\">Mariko</a>, Wolverine's betrothed. During their stay in Japan, Storm spends time with a thief, <a href=\"/yukio/29-9843/\">Yukio</a>, and sees drastic changes to her looks and personality. She adopts a more punk look, cutting her incredibly long hair into a Mohawk and wearing leather and spikes. Combined with her Morlock vest, it is a vast change from her previous looks and temperament. During this time, Storm was rendered powerless by <a href=\"/mystique/29-1469/\">Mystique</a>, who shot her with a gun used to suppress mutant gene's when aiming for her foster daughter, Rogue.</p><h3>The Summers Family Expands</h3><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"808196\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-medium\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/808196-madelyne_pryor1_super.jpg\" title=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\"><img id=\"808196\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/3/36894/808196-madelyne_pryor1_medium.jpg\" alt=\"Scott and Madelyne get married!\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Scott and Madelyne get married!</div></div></div></div><p>Around this same time, Scott married a woman named <a href=\"/madelyne-pryor/29-10981/\">Madelyne Pryor</a> who was the spitting image of Jean Grey.

He was slowly on the path to dying and refused to burden his students with it. At this point, he also invited Magneto to stay at the mansion with them as he had begun to repent for his past misdeeds. Also at this time, it was decided that Storm and Cyclops could no longer share the leadership responsibilities and there must be a decision made.

The X-Men join with the new government sponsored version of X-Factor and members of X-Force to clear Cable's name and find the missing X-Men.

The <a href=\"../../legacy-virus/12-42281/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Legacy Virus</a> was a disease that attacked only mutants and caused their powers to become powerfully out of control to a fatal end. The virus hit close to home with mutants suffering that had close ties to the X-Men like Pyro, <a href=\"../../revanche/29-9709/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Revanche</a> and Colossus' young sister Illyana Rasputin. Illyana, who had been reverted to childhood following the events of the Inferno, was still a latent mutant in her current form and was the first casualty of the virus. It hit Colossus hard as he had just lost both of his parents soon before. The X-Men held a vigil in her honor with all X-Teams in attendance to mourn her death. Wishing to pay his respects and offer asylum to any and all mutants interested, Magneto crashed the funeral in a show of misplaced aggression. He attacked the X-Teams and if not for the intervention of Colossus, would have lost. Colossus then states that he has lost faith in the dreams of other men, namely Xavier, and wishes to make his own path in a new world and joins Magneto in Asteroid M.</p><p>The X-Men waste little time putting together a strike force to infiltrate Asteroid M and discover the true intent of Magneto and the <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a>. The Professor chooses a small team of <a href=\"../../quicksilver/29-1467/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quicksilver</a>, Wolverine, Rogue, Gambit, Jean Grey and himself. The mission is successful until confronted by Magneto. In his rage, Magnus attacks the X-Men and makes short work of most of the team. In one of the most shocking moments in comic history, he aggressively fights Wolverine and rips out his adamantium skeleton. The Professor decides that enough is enough and his former friend cannot be saved and wipes his mind. Jean Grey then takes over leadership and forces the team back to the craft while keeping the Professor breathing and Wolverine alive. In the end, Wolverine is left in a feral state with very little active healing ability and unsure of his life and purpose.</p><p>With the Acolytes now in a power struggle, <a href=\"../../fabian-cortez/29-9728/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabian Cortez</a> assumes leadership over Magneto's followers. He kidnaps Magneto's granddaughter and daughter to Quicksilver and the Avenger, <a href=\"../../crystal/29-2115/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Crystal</a> and claims her in the name of Magneto. This enrages the Avengers and the X-Men who join forces to save <a href=\"/luna/29-10962/\">Luna</a> and take back Genosha. Cortez is defeated and <a href=\"../../exodus/29-4567/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus</a> takes a leadership role with the Acolytes.</p><h3>Phalanx Covenant</h3><p>For more information regarding this arc, see: <a href=\"../../phalanx-covenant/39-42176/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phalanx Covenant</a></p><p>After recently returning to the mansion, Banshee notices small oddities with the mansion and its inhabitants.

Meanwhile, Jean Grey and Cyclops have been on vacation away from the X-Men, saving themselves from imprisonment by the <a href=\"../../phalanx/29-9651/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phalanx</a>. They join with Cable and Wolverine and search for the missing X-Men. Professor X, who had been offsite as well, gathered X-Force, X-Factor and Excalibur together in an old Acolyte base to form a plan. Knowing that the X-Men have been compromised, the other X-Teams split into three strike forces: one to infiltrate the Phalanx with \" <a href=\"../../warlock/29-7223/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Douglock</a>\", a resurrected Warlock with the memories of Doug Ramsey; one to confront a cluster of the Phalanx serving as the breeding grounds to a new generation of Earth born Phalanx; and one team to stay at the Acolyte base if all else fails. Forge is successful in creating a feedback which disables the birth of the new Phalanx. Douglock and his team stop the heralding beacon from summoning the rest of the Phalanx.</p><p>Cyclops team finds and rescues the captured X-Men almost simultaneously and discovers that Cameron Hodge plays a huge role in allowing the Phalanx entry and knowledge of our world.

Later while fighting Sentinels the team recruited Iceman. The Brotherhood of Mutants sent a spy to infiltrate the X-Men group to kill Professor X. They sent Wolverine. Magneto, The Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, <a href=\"../../toad/29-1470/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Toad</a>, Multiple Man, the <a href=\"../../blob/29-3182/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blob</a> and Mastermind form the Brotherhood and they had kidnapped the President\u00b4s daughter. The X-Men saved her and in the last moment Wolverine had a change of heart and instead of killing Xavier he tried to kill Magneto, while he sent Sentinels to kill humans. In the end Xavier killed Magneto with the help of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.</p><p>Xavier then started helping Wolverine to find out where were the people who gave him the metal implants. <a href=\"../../weapon-x/65-50418/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weapon X</a> did all the implants and they found it. Then the X-Men were abducted by Weapon X and were tortured and they even made Beast blue.</p><p>Ultimate <a href=\"../../alpha-flight/65-14616/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Alpha Flight</a> arrived and seemingly kill Iceman and now the X-Men face these strange super powered team. Beast puts Iceman back together but Alpha Flight arrive to take Northstar, something that Colossus isn't very happy about. Alpha Flight was under the influence of a power enhancing drug called <a href=\"../../banshee/18-55849/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Banshee</a>. Taking <a href=\"../../northstar/29-3190/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Northstar</a> had Colossus so mad Dazzler, Nightcrawler, Rouge and him went after Alpha Flight. Cyclops went along to prevent anything stupid from happening. The <a href=\"../../acolytes/65-9730/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acolytes</a> appeared into the picture and caused the death of Northstar. Colossus and the rest of the people who went along went under Banshee drug and enhanced their powers. Dazzler could maneuver her powers to create anything, Rouge could keep the power she absorbed, Nightcrawler could go to greater lengths, Colossus became stronger, and Cyclops could control his eye beams and fly.</p><p>Jean Grey had taken it into her own hands to lead the X-Men and she was driving them around pretty hard. Nightcrawler contacted her saying that they needed help from themselves because they were addicted to the power enhancer. Wolverine had figured out that he was positive to have been dosed with Banshee so he went to <a href=\"../../spider-man/29-1443/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Peter Parker</a> for help to sort things out. Kitty and Peter were dealing with Banshee addicts themselves when Wolverine arrived. Peter explained that he was positive because he was Banshee the drug was made by taking properties of him. The X-Men went after the addicted X-Men and fought it off. Jean went off for a moment while she talked to her father as Phoenix when then she fell unconscious. Logan blamed Colossus for it so he took his heart out for it.</p><p>Both X-Men embark on a flight until Phoenix stops it all. Everyone cools down for the exception of Cyclops that flies to the moon. During the fight Wolverine looses a leg to Colossus. Phoenix show to Colossus that Northstar is okay except that he is paralyzed from the waist down. Colossus and Wolverine are fixed up by Jean after that and then Jean heads to the moon. Wolverine using some of the Banshee Colossus bought he tracked it down to Muir Island blaming Xavier for it. Jean talked to Scott and after that he said he wanted to keep the power the Banshee started wearing off so she put his glasses back on. The Prof. was who created Banshee from Wolverine along with Magneto but Moira distributed it. She fought Wolverine with her \"Screaming\" powers. In the end Wolverine destroyed the whole facility. Quicksilver then arrived an told Moira that Magneto had newer plans for the near future.</p><p>20 Years into the future a new X-Men team that consisted of <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Captain America</a>, Wolverine, Shadowcat, Rogue and a male Phoenix wanted to prevent the events of <a href=\"../../ultimatum/39-55745/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimatum</a> so they traveled back in time to stop it.</p><p>Reed and Sue were going to go on a date when the future X-Men arrived trying to kill Reed. Reed not having any internal organs couldn't be killed so they kidnapped him. The rest of the Fantastic Four went to the present X-Men for help. Reed discovered that the future male Phoenix was actually his son Franklin Richards. Then future Wolverine attempted to kill Phoenix. Then the rest of the future X-Men discovered that future Wolverine was actually a Sentinel from the future. By the time the FF and present X-Men got there many Wolverine Sentinels had been destroyed had killed Rouge and had taken Reed into the future. Captain America was dying and Jean unmasked him revealing he was actually Scott. He told the group that himself, Jean and the original Cap had been stripped away of their powers so he took over as Captain America after <a href=\"../../captain-america/29-1442/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Steve Rogers</a> aged 100 years, then he died. In the future Iceman was captured by the Sentinels and Reed escaped his cell when he followed a trail of fire. Thinking it to be <a href=\"../../human-torch/29-2120/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Johnny</a> he then saw the future Fantastic Four: Invisible Woman, Iron Thing, <a href=\"../../namor/29-1476/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Namor</a> and <a href=\"../../liz-allan/29-15408/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Firestar</a>.</p><p>The future X-Men, or what was left of them told the present X-Men and FF that the reason that they needed to stop it all was because the new ruler was getting rid of mutants. That new ruler was Sue. Future Sue convinced present Reed to fix a machine that would strip away people of their powers just like Cyclops\u00b4s Reed gave to her request while the present X-Men, present FF, and future X-men went into the future to find out what was going on. <a href=\"../../thing/29-2114/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben</a> and Firestar found out that both of them in the future were in love and Iceman found himself being killed by Namor. Sue met <a href=\"../../mr-fantastic/29-2151/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nihil</a> again then just to find out that he was actually future Reed. Future Phoenix turned everyone in to his mother. Reed then took away future Sue\u00b4s powers since clearly she had gone crazy because of her brother\u00b4s death. Everyone let the future hero\u00b4s free from a prison in the <a href=\"../../the-negative-zone/34-40699/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Negative Zone</a> Sue had made to maintain the super powered heroes. The present FF and X-Men went back to their own time and Sue and Reed left to be alone. Sue told Reed she was worried that would eventually happen to them, but Reed assured that it would not. Sue left and then from a drawer Reed took out a ring, sure that, that future would not happen.</p><p>In <a href=\"../../ultimate-x-men/49-7258/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ultimate X-Men</a> #100 we find that The Academy of Tomorrow has been attacked by Madrox on behalf of Magneto.

Professor Xavier believes sociopath is the next step in human evolution. The X-Men are framed for killing their own member Jean Grey by way of three cuts over the back and face. Leader of the police force known as \" <a href=\"../../brotherhood-of-evil-mutants/65-17652/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Brotherhood</a>\" named <a href=\"../../magneto/29-1441/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magnus</a> is put in charge of the investigation. As the search for the X-Men continues more and more of them are found dead. When a member of the city's police tracks down the X-Men's new leader Scott Summers and is informed that someone is setting them up. When he tells them to go to the police Scott responds. \"We're the X-Men, and no one is on our side\". Meanwhile a mysterious man in a bright red cape is investigating the crimes himself. After Warren Worthington is thrown from a roof top and Hank McCoy is shot and killed in a run in with The Brotherhood, Magnus orders the Brotherhood to take down <a href=\"../../sebastian-shaw/29-2175/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sebastian Shaw</a> (a powerful mob boss) and his Hellfire Club. Magnus believes with the X-Men out of his way and the Hellfire club killed off, the city will be \"his\". He meets with <a href=\"../../rogue/29-1446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Anne-Marie Rankin</a> to learn the whereabouts of the last few X-Men but she kills him instead. The caped figure later realizes that Jean Grey is not dead. What happened was that she killed Anne-Marie Rankin and took her place, because she wanted to avoid being studied by Xavier or exploited by Magnus. She then says she knows that the caped figure cannot kill her and pulls a gun on him but he then reveals that he is the twin brother of who she thinks he is and then pushes her off the roof causing them both to fall to their death. His twin, accompanied by Scott finds their bodies and says that he lost him years ago by what he had become. He recants about how when he and his brother both worked at a prison they started the whole cape thing because it made the inmates think he was in two places at the same time (making it seem like he has super powers). They meet up with <a href=\"../../wolverine/29-1440/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Logan</a> and sail off together.</p><h3><b>Egg's Men</b></h3><p>In the Showcase No. 65, It's revealed on Earth-Twelve the X-Men exist as the Egg's Men.

Both creators however, share credit for this character. As for the <a href=\"/joker/29-1702/\">Joker</a>, the first concept sketch was drawn by <a href=\"/jerry-robinson/26-9680/\">Jerry Robinson</a>, but Kane disputed that his input was \"minimal\" suggesting he and Bill came up with the idea. Kane also finagled many legal aspects of Batman related print and media. Every movie and comic reads \"Batman created by Bob Kane\" when it should read \"Batman created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger\". However It is not disputed that Robinson and Finger came up with the character, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Robin</a> after \"Robinhood\" . Bob Kane and Sheldon Moldoff co-created numerous bat-creations including <a href=\"/alfred/29-5556/\">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, <a href=\"/poison-ivy/29-1697/\">Poison Ivy,</a> <a href=\"/mr-freeze/29-3715/\">Mr. Freeze</a>, <a href=\"/batwoman/29-9052/\">Batwoman</a>, <a href=\"/batgirl/49-7205/\">Batgirl</a> as well as <a href=\"/bat-mite/29-23170/\">Bat-Mite</a> and <a href=\"/ace-the-bat-hound/29-31302/\">Ace the Bat Hound</a> just to name a few. <a href=\"/bill-finger/26-43591/\">Bill Finger</a> also co-created <a href=\"/penguin/29-4885/\">Penguin</a>, <a href=\"/riddler/29-3718/\">Riddler</a>, and <a href=\"/catwoman/29-1698/\">Catwoman</a>.</p><div class=\"js-item-cage\" rel=\"image\" title=\"image\" id=\"1681131\"><div class=\"wiki-img-right\"><div class=\"wiki-img-thumb\"><a href=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/1681131-batman1ad_super.jpg\" title=\"Ad for Batman #1\"><img id=\"1681131\" src=\"http://media.comicvine.com/uploads/6/64507/1681131-batman1ad_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Ad for Batman #1\" /></a><div class=\"item-caption\">Ad for Batman #1</div></div></div></div><p>One of DC's longest running books showcasing the adventures of the Dark Knight, <a href=\"/batman/29-1699/\">Batman</a>. Through out the years, a majority of Batman's marquee story lines have happened within the pages of this book including, but not limited to the death of the second Robin, <a href=\"/jason-todd/29-6849/\">Jason Todd</a>, and <a href=\"/bane/29-6129/\">Bane</a> breaking Batman's back, leading to <a href=\"/jean-paul-valley/29-12834/\">Jean-Paul Valley</a> to assume the role of Batman for a period of time in the 90s.</p><p>In 2006, super-star writer <a href=\"/grant-morrison/26-40434/\">Grant Morrison</a> took over the book. Morrison wrote stories that introduced readers to Bruce's son <a href=\"/damian-wayne/29-42413/\">Damian Wayne</a> as well as putting Bruce through a series of near fatal trials against <a href=\"/black-glove/65-54825/\">The Black Glove</a> and <a href=\"/doctor-hurt/29-54826/\">Doctor Hurt</a>, leading up to the epic 2008 story lines of <a href=\"/batman-rip/39-55116/\">Batman RIP</a> and <a href=\"/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a> where Bruce Wayne had apparently died at the hands of the evil god <a href=\"/darkseid/29-2349/\">Darkseid</a>.</p><p>After Bruce's \"death,\" and the <a href=\"/battle-for-the-cowl/39-55808/\">Battle for the Cowl</a>, <a href=\"/dick-grayson/29-1691/\">Dick Grayson</a>, the first Robin, took up the mantle of Batman, continuing to protect Gotham exactly as his mentor had. He even took in Damian as his own Robin. With the exception of two issues set prior to the events of <a href=\"/final-crisis/39-51642/\">Final Crisis</a>, Dick Grayson has been the star of the book since issue #687.</p><p>When the super hero community learned that Bruce Wayne had never actually died, and was sent back in time by Darkseid, Dick Grayson eventually knew that his time as Batman would soon end. But with Bruce's return, and formation of <a href=\"/batman-inc/65-57839/\">Batman Incorporated</a>, Bruce deemed Dick Grayson the Batman of Gotham City, as he traveled the world, searching for more recruits for his new organization.</p><p><a href=\"/charles-paris/26-38494/\">Charles Paris</a> has drawn the most issues of Batman thus far at 128. <a href=\"/dennis-oneil/26-40861/\">Denny O'Neil</a> is a long time writer and editor at DC with 211 issues. He also contributed the location of <a href=\"/arkham-asylum/34-31682/\">Arkham Asylum</a> as well as the characters <a href=\"/man-bat/29-6131/\">Man-Bat</a>, <a href=\"/ras-al-ghul/29-40816/\">Ra's al Ghul</a> and <a href=\"/talia-al-ghul/29-4917/\">Talia al Ghul</a>.</p><p>In September 2011, DC Comics relaunched their entire line in an event known as \"<a href=\"/the-new-52/12-56061/\">The New 52</a>\" which would see the premiere of fifty-two new titles, thus the long-running Batman series ended with #713 during <a href=\"/tony-daniel/26-4663/\">Tony S. Daniel</a>'s run on the title. In the new line, however, Tony Daniel will continue writing in the \"Batman universe\" but under the character's other main title, <a href=\"/detective-comics/49-18058/\">Detective Comics</a>. The new Batman series will be written instead by Scott Snyder (who was writing Detective Comics pre-relaunch).</p><h4>For Post <a href=\"/flashpoint/39-56280/\">Flashpoint</a> volume 2, refer to <a href=\"/batman/49-42721/\">Batman</a>.</h4><p><b>Trade Volumes that collect Batman issues:</b></p><p><b>Classic and Archived Batman:</b></p><ul><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-one/37-233426/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 1</a> (Batman #1, Detective Comics #27-37)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-two/37-233429/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 2</a> (Batman #2-3, Detective Comics #39-45, New York World's Fair Comic #2)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-three/37-233431/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 3</a> (Batman #4-5, Detective Comics #46-50, World's Finest #1)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-four/37-233433/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 4</a> (Batman #6-7, Detective Comics #51-56, World's Finest #2-3)</li><li><a href=\"../../the-batman-chronicles-volume-five/37-233436/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Batman Chronicles Volume 5</a> (Batman #8-9, Detective Comics #57-61, World's Finest #4)</li></ul><p><i>see also Batman Archives, Batman: The Dark Knight Archives, Batman: The Dynamic Duo Archives etc...</i></p><p><b>Modern Batman</b> (Post-Crisis)</p><ul><li><a href=\"/batman-year-one/49-18960/\">Batman: Year One</a> (Batman #404-407)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-the-many-deaths-of-batman/49-37883/\">Batman: The Many Deaths of Batman</a> (Batman #433-435)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-ten-nights-of-the-beast/49-34113/\">Batman: Ten Nights of the Beast</a> (#417-420)</li><li><a href=\"/batman-a-death-in-the-family/49-25187/\">Batman: A Death in the Family</a> (Batman #426-429)</li><li><a href=\"/robin-the-teen-wonder/49-38554/\">Robin: The Teen Wonder</a> (Batman #428 and 442, <span>Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight #100, Nightwing #101, Batman #428 and 442, Robin #126 and 132, and Teen Titans #29)</span></li><li><a href=\"/robin-a-hero-reborn/49-20003/\">Robin: A Hero Reborn</a> (Batman #455-457 and Robin #1-5)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-knightfall-vol-1-broken-bat/37-217582/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Knightfall Part 1: Broken Bat</a> (Batman #491-497, Detective Comics #659-663)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-knightfall-vol-2-who-rules-the-night/37-217584/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Knightfall Part 2: Who Rules the Night</a> (Batman #498-500, Detective Comics #664-666, Showcase '93 #7-8, Shadow of the Bat #16-18)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-knightfall-vol-3-knightsend/37-217586/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: Knightfall Part 3: Knightsend</a> (Batman #509-510)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-1/37-118196/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 1</a> ( Batman #563-564, No Man's Land #1, Shadow of the Bat #83-84, Detective Comics #730-731, Legends of the Dark Knight #116)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-2/37-131427/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 2</a> (Batman #565, Shadow of the Bat #85-87, Detective Comics #732-733, Legends of the Dark Knight #117, #119, Batman Chronicles #16)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-three/37-131428/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 3</a> (Batman #566-569, Shadow of the Bat #88, Detective Comics #734-735, Legends of the Dark Knight #120-121)</li><li><a href=\"../../batman-no-mans-land-volume-four/37-131446/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Batman: No Man's Land Vol. 4</a> (Batman #571-572, Shadow of the Bat #92-93, Detective Comics #736, #
